ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      The present Revision Petition is against the impugned order dated 26.09.2013 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Bhopal (for short “State Commission”) whereby the appeal by the complainant was partly allowed.
2.      The issue is the determination of compensation if the consumer is victim of unfair trade practice.
3.      Brief facts are that the complainant purchased a car from the M/s. Star Automobiles Ltd with an assurance that model was of year 2011 and its average will be 24 km/ltr. The complainant paid  Rs. 5,65,000/- as price of the car. On verification it was noticed that the vehicle was manufactured in August, 2010 and not giving the mileage as promised. Therefore, alleging deficiency on the part of the OPs, the complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum, Katni (M.P.).
4.      The complaint was resisted by the OPs by filing their respective replies and denied the allegations.
5.      The District Forum, after hearing both the parties dismissed the complaint as the complainant failed to prove any deficiency in service of the OPs.
6.      The complainant appealed in the State Commission. The appeal was partly allowed by the State Commission holding the OP-1 Star Automobiles, guilty of unfair trade practice and vide its Order dated 26.09.2013 directed the OP-1 to pay  Rs. 5,000/- to the complainant within a month failing which it shall bear interest @ 9 % from the date of this order.
7.      Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the complainant approached this Commission.
8.      There is a delay of 55 days in filing the present Revision Petition. For the reasons stated in the application for condonation of delay and in the interest of justice, the delay of 55 days is condoned.
9.      We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the material on record.
10.    This case is the glaring example of Unfair Trade Practice from the vehicle dealer. On perusal of record we are surprised to note that the dealer issued two Sale Certificates for one vehicle mentioning different month and year of manufacture. Admittedly, the vehicle was manufactured in 2010 (Model: 2010) but sold in 2011.
11.    It is pertinent to note that, the complainant is 74 years old, resident of Katni. The incidence was of 2011, now we are in 2020. The complaint suffered monetary loss and mental agony due to such unfair act of OP-1, however we note the State Commission’s award of Rs. 5000/- is very meagre and is not just and adequate in the ends of justice.
12.    We upheld and affirm the unfair trade practice as determined by the State Commission in its impugned order dated 26.09.2013. The unfairness is writ large committed by the OP-1 dealer and it should be dealt with stern hand.
13.    In respect of the said unfair trade practice, the  OP-1 dealer is put to stern advice of caution through imposition of cost of Rs. 2,00,000/- to be paid to the complainant and cost of Rs. 50,000/- to be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum within four weeks from today, failing which it shall attract interest at the rate of 9% per annum after expiry of four weeks from today till its actual realisation.
14.    Hence, disposed off.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
15.  In the interest of justice, considering the reasons stated in the application for condonation of delay, and in order to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing the Petition is condoned.
16.  The short point in this case is that the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, purchased a car from the Dealer, the Respondent No. 1 herein, in June 2011. The Dealer delivered a car manufactured in August 2010, after conveying and making to understand that it was manufactured in the year of sale i.e. 2011. That is to say, when payment of the entire consideration amount was made in June 2011, a car of the make 2010 was delivered to the Complainant, rather than a car of the make of the year of sale i.e. of the make 2011.
","17.  The District Forum dismissed the Complaint.
In Appeal filed by the Complainant, the State Commission appraised the evidence and vide its impugned Order dated 26.09.2013 conclusively determined that a car of the make August 2010 was delivered in June 2011, when it was conveyed and understood that it would be of the make 2011. The State Commission held the Dealer liable for ‘unfair trade practice’, and awarded a sum of Rs. 5,000/- to the Complainant, to be paid within one month, failing which it would carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum.
The Complainant filed the instant Petition before this Commission, seeking enhancement in compensation.
18.  From the record placed before this Commission, it is noted that the Complainant made payment of a sum of Rs.5,65,000/- to the Dealer vide a demand draft dated 24.06.2011. A Retail Invoice dated 25.06.2011, issued by the Dealer, shows the total consideration amount (inclusive of all accessories) to be Rs. 5,65,000/-.
As such, the Complainant paid the entire consideration amount to the Dealer in June 2011.
The Dealer issued a Sale Certificate dated 25.06.2011 in which the “Month, Year of manufacturer” was written as “August, 2010”. The Dealer subsequently issued another Sale Certificate dated 25.06.2011 in which the “Month, Year of manufacture” was written as “JUNE, 2011”.
As such, it is well evinced that a car manufactured in August 2010 was delivered in June 2011, and, on the Complainant objecting, an ex facie suspicious second Sale Certificate was issued (dated the very same day as of the first Certificate) in which the month and year of manufacture were shown to be June 2011.
19.  The State Commission has succinctly appraised the case in para 4 of its impugned Order:
4. However, the two certificates issued by the dealer-respondent No. 1, in respect of description of the vehicle and in both different dates of manufacturing having been mentioned, it is a clear case where the dealer tried to pass on a vehicle of old model as current model and thereafter to patch up this misconduct, he issued another certificate/invoice showing that the vehicle was manufactured in June, 2011. Thus, an old model car was passed on as a merchandise of the year 2011, which was not true. We find that the dealer-respondent No. 1-, Star Automobiles, is guilty of unfair trade practice and is liable to pay compensation to the appellant.
20.  In respect of the facts of the case the State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order, no palpable error in appreciating the evidence is visible.
21.  It may be noted here that ‘unfair trade practice’ is a specific provision unique to The Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
Section 2(1)(r) says of “a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following practices, namely:-”.
The list provided in Section 2(1)(r) is illustrative and not comprehensive.
That is to say, an unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice, as is judiciously determined, on fact and reason, on fair and objective appraisal of the evidence and material on record, would qualify as ‘unfair trade practice’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r).
In the instant case, on obtaining the total consideration for a new car in June 2011, the selling of an old car of the make August 2010, when it was conveyed and understood that the car would be of the make of the year of sale i.e. of the make 2011, is decidedly unfair and deceptive within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r).
22.  In addition to ‘deficiency in service’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(g) & (o) of the Act 1986, ‘unfair trade practice’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) is well and truly evident.
23.  It may also be noted that this is one particular instance that has come to notice before the Consumer Protection Fora. The eventuality of other such instances, with other ‘consumer’(s), as an intermittent or regular practice, cannot be ruled out.
24.  All this is not viewed favourably.
25.  On the basis of the examination made hereinabove, the findings and Award are firmed-up as below:
[a]   The State Commission’s impugned Order is modified to the extent that the Dealer is unequivocally held liable for both ‘deficiency in service’ and ‘unfair trade practice’.
It may be added that the liability qua the Complainant initiated the day he paid the full consideration amount for a new car to the Dealer, and it continues, as a continuing wrong.
[b]   The Award made by the State Commission is modified to the extent that the Dealer shall pay a sum of Rs. 2 lakh to the Complainant, to compensate him for his loss and injury, within four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
In addition, the Dealer is put to stern advice of caution through imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/-, which shall be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum within four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
The afore shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of expiry of four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this Order till the date of actual realisation.
[c]   The Manufacturer, the Respondent No. 2 herein, through its Chief Executive, is ordered under Section 14(1)(f) of the Act 1986 to most immediately pass appropriate directions to all its dealers to ensure that such unfair and deceptive acts are forthwith discontinued by its dealers, and ‘consumer’(s) are not put to such loss and injury.
The Chief Executive is also advised to imbibe accountability and systemic improvements for future.
The Chief Executive shall furnish a report-in-compliance to the District Forum within eight weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
26.  For failure or omission in compliance, within the respective stipulated period, the District Forum shall undertake execution, for ‘Enforcement’ under Section 25(3) and for ‘Penalties’ under Section 27 of the Act 1986, as per the law.
27.  A copy each of this Order be sent by the Registry [a] to the District Forum, [b] to the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, [c] to the Dealer, the Respondent No. 1 herein, and [d] to the Chief Executive of the Manufacturer, the Respondent No. 2 herein, within three days of its pronouncement.

","HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents no.1 in these appeals booked residential flats with the appellant in a project namely ‘Morpheus Pratiksha’ which the appellant was to develop on Plot No.GH-16A in Sector-1 of Greater Noida (West).  On allotment of residential flats to them, they executed agreements with the appellant in May 2015.  In terms of clause 19(a) of the agreement, the development was to be completed within 36 months of start of excavation/signing of the agreement which could vary by + six months.  The possession, calculated from the date of the execution of the agreements, therefore, ought to have been offered after completing the construction by November 2018 after giving the benefit of the grace period of six months to the appellant.
2.      The purchase of the apartments was financed by the complainants partly through loan taken from respondent no.2 DHFL under a subvention scheme.  Under the said scheme designed by the appellant by way of a special arrangement with DHFL, the flat buyers were not liable towards any interest or pre-EMI for 36 months or till the date of possession whichever was to be earlier.  The liability of the flat buyers to pay the EMIs was to commence on completion of 36 months or on receiving possession whichever was to be earlier.
3.      The grievance of the complainants is that the project was not completed and consequently, the possession was not offered to them despite they having made substantial payment to the appellant directly as well as through the loan taken from DHFL under the subvention scheme of the appellant.  The complainants therefore, approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking refund of the amount which they had paid alongwith compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the appellant which admitted the allotment made to the complainants as well as the arrangement under subvention scheme.  Though a written version was filed by the appellant, its lawyer did not appear after filing the said written version and consequently, no affidavit on behalf of the appellant was filed.
5.      Vide impugned order dated 16.04.2019, the State Commission directed as under:
On the basis of aforesaid conclusion the complaint is partly allowed and the opposite party No.1 and 2 is directed to pay a sum of Rs.22,94,138/- i.e. sanctioned loan amount to the opposite party no.3 with interest and to pay the complainant a sum of Rs.4,55,000/- with interest @ 18% per annum from the date of payment till realization.
The opposite party No.1 and 2 is further directed to pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- as cost to the complainant.
Apartment from the above referred opposite party No.3 is directed not to recover the loan in question from the complainant.
6.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission.
7.      The admitted position is that the appellant had allotted residential flats in the above noted project to the complainants.  It is also an admitted position that an agreement was executed by the appellant with the complainants incorporating the respective rights and obligations of the parties in respect of the allotment made to the complainants.  It is also an admitted position that the appellant has not been able to complete the construction of the apartments by November 2018.  Though technically speaking, the Consumer Complaints can be said to be pre-mature having been instituted before November 2018, the aforesaid circumstance would become irrelevant considering that the deadline of November 2018 also expired more than one year ago and even before the impugned order came to be passed by the State Commission.
8.      The learned counsel for the appellant states that in view of the directions given by NCLAT on 04.06.2019 in Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No.211 of 2019, the appellant shall offer possession of the allotted flats to the complainants by November 2020.  The complainants who are present in the Court clearly state that they do not want to wait till November 2020 and want refund of the amount paid by them directly as well as through DHFL to the appellant, alongwith compensation on that amount.  They however, state that as far as the amount paid by them to the appellant from their own funds is concerned, they are pressing for payment of interest only @ 10% per annum from the date of each payment till the date of refund but on the amount which the DHFL paid to the appellant on their behalf, the appellant should pay interest which DHFL has charged from them.
9.      In my opinion, considering the past conduct of the appellant, which failed to deliver possession in almost five years from the date on which allotment was made to the complainants, there is no guarantee that the appellant will comply with the order passed by NCLAT and will deliver possession to the complainants after obtaining the requisite Occupancy Certificate by November 2020.  The appellants therefore, cannot be made to wait further and thereby expose themselves to the risk of faced with the same situation, in which they are placed today.  The complainants therefore, are entitled to refund of the amount which they paid to the appellant directly as well as through DHFL with appropriate interest by way of compensation.
10.    The learned counsel for the appellant relying upon clause 19(c) of the Agreement, submits that the complainants are entitled only to agreed compensation of Rs.5/- per sq. ft. per month of the super area of the apartment.  Such clause in the Apartment Buyers Agreement have consistently been held to be unfair and unreasonable being wholly one-sided on which the flat buyer has no control.  A reference in this regard can be made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghavan (2019) 5 SCC 725 which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
“6.4. A perusal of the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement dated 08.05.2012 reveals stark incongruities between the remedies available to both the parties.
For instance, Clause 6.4 (ii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant – Builder to charge Interest @18% p.a. on account of any delay in payment of installments from the Respondent – Flat Purchaser.
Clause 6.4 (iii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant – Builder to cancel the allotment and terminate the Agreement, if any installment remains in arrears for more than 30 days.
On the other hand, as per Clause 11.5 of the Agreement, if the Appellant – Builder fails to deliver possession of the apartment within the stipulated period, the Respondent – Flat Purchaser has to wait for a period of 12 months after the end of the grace period, before serving a Termination Notice of 90 days on the Appellant – Builder, and even thereafter, the Appellant – Builder gets 90 days to refund only the actual installment paid by the Respondent – Flat Purchaser, after adjusting the taxes paid, interest and penalty on delayed payments. In case of any delay thereafter, the Appellant – Builder is liable to pay Interest @ 9% p.a. only.
6.5. Another instance is Clause 23.4 of the Agreement which entitles the Appellant – Builder to serve a Termination Notice upon the Respondent – Flat Purchaser for breach of any contractual obligation. If the Respondent – Flat Purchaser fails to rectify the default within 30 days of the Termination Notice, then the Agreement automatically stands cancelled, and the Appellant – Builder has the right to forfeit the entire amount of Earnest Money towards liquidated damages.
On the other hand, as Clause 11.5 (v) of the Agreement, if the Respondent – Flat Purchaser fails to exercise his right of termination within the time limit provided in Clause 11.5, then he shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement thereafter, and shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.
6.6. Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines ‘unfair trade practices’ in the following words :
“‘unfair trade practice’ means a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice …”, and includes any of the practices enumerated therein. The provision is illustrative, and not exhaustive.
6.7. A term of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat purchasers had no option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the builder.
The contractual terms of the Agreement dated 08.05.2012 are ex-facie one-sided, unfair, and unreasonable. The incorporation of such one-sided clauses in an agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of selling the flats by the Builder.”
","11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of with the following directions:-
(i)      The entire amount which DHFL paid to the appellant on behalf of the complainants, shall be refunded by the appellant to DHFL within three months from today, alongwith such interest to which DHFL is entitled from the complainants.  It shall however be open to the appellant to arrive at a settlement with DHFL with respect to the said amount but the said settlement has to ensure that no liability comes upon the complainants either in respect of the principal amount paid by DHFL or in respect of interest or penalty, etc. on that amount.
(ii)     The amount which the appellant received directly from the complainants, shall be refunded to the complainants within three months from today alongwith compensation on that amount in the form of simple interest @ 10% per annum with effect from the date of each payment till the date of full refund.
(iii)    The complainants shall be entitled to the cost of litigation as awarded by the State Commission.

  For the Respondent      :For the Punjab and Sind Bank	Mr M S Rana, Advocate 
","PER MR PREM NARAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
The present appeal no. 337 of 2014 has been filed by the Punjab and Sind Bank and appeal no. 781 of 2015 has been filed by Jaipal Singh Soor against the orders dated 27th March 2014 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in FA no. 62 of 2012.
2.     Brief facts are that the father of the complainant had fixed deposit nos. 853186, 853187, 853188 and 853189 with the opposite party bank. Though there was a nominee in the fixed deposits, however, the nominee pre-deceased the holder of the fixed deposits. After the death of the holder of the fixed deposits, the complainant filed an application for giving the proceeds of the fixed deposits to him on the basis of Letter of Administration from the High Court of England dated 24.07.2009. The bank asked formalities to be completed before the payment could be made. As the complainant felt aggrieved by the demands of the Bank for completing the formalities, he filed a consumer complaint no. 62 of 2012 before the State Commission. The complaint was resisted by the opposite party Bank by filing the written reply stating that the original of the Letter of Administration of the High Court of England was not filed with the Bank and therefore, it was not possible to honour the same and release the proceeds to the complainant. During the pendency of the complaint, the complainant filed the original Letter of Administration of the High Court of England and the State Commission released the amount to the complainant. However, the State Commission finally decided the complaint and ordered the opposite party bank to pay Rs.2.00 lakh as compensation to the complainant for delaying the payment and for harassing the complainant.
3.     The bank has filed an appeal no.337 of 2014 against the order dated 27.03.2014 of the State Commission on the ground that there was no deficiency of service on the part of the Bank, therefore, award of compensation of Rs.2.00 lakh was not justified. The complainant has also filed cross appeal no. 781 of 2015 against the same impugned order on the ground that the State Commission has not paid the amount spent on air tickets from England to India as the complainant had to come three-four times for this purpose only.
4.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record. Learned counsel for the respondent Bank stated that when the photocopy of the Letter of Administration of High Court of England was filed by the complainant, the Bank asked for the death certificate of the nominee so that the claim of any other LR may be processed. The complainant has not filed the death certificate of the nominee till today. It is mentioned on the 1st page of the Letter of Administration issued by the High Court of England that this grant is not valid unless it bears the impressed seal of the court. Thus, the original Letter of Administration was required from the complainant and the same was mentioned in the written statement filed by the Bank. As soon as the complainant submitted the original copy of the Letter of Administration, the bank immediately released the amount of FDs to the complainant as per the rules of the bank. Thus, there is no deficiency of service on the part of the Bank in releasing the proceeds of FDs to the complainant, rather the complainant was deficient in many respects. The State Commission has even then awarded compensation of Rs.2.00 lakh to the complainant to be given by the opposite party Bank. The present first appeal has been filed for setting aside the order of the State Commission for award of compensation of Rs.2.00 lakh. There is a delay of 17 days in filing the present appeal. The delay has happened due to the requirement of getting higher orders from the Headquarter of the Bank for filing the appeal in the matter. As the delay is of 17 days, the same may be condoned.
5.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the complainant stated that the opposite party demanded various documents to satisfy themselves, even though the photocopy of the Letter of Administration of High Court of England was already filed with the Bank. Had the bank informed immediately that the original Letter of Administration was required, the complainant would have received the amount in time. As different documents were demanded at different times by the Bank, the complainant had to come 3-4 times to India from England where he is settled. It was stated by the learned counsel that it is not correct to say that there was no deficiency on the part of the Bank in not intimating timely to the complainant that the original Letter of Administration was required. The present appeal by the complainant has been filed for enhancing the amount of compensation, as the State Commission has not considered the compensation for the Air Tickets from England to India 3-4 times.  Learned counsel for the complainant further states that there is a delay of 501 days in filing the present appeal. The delay has happened due to the fact that the complainant had to come from England and when he came from England he attended to this case and decided to file the appeal, hence, the delay has happened which may be condoned in the circumstances mentioned in the application for condonation of delay.
6.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the parties and have examined the record.   First of all, it is seen that there is a delay of 17 days in filing the appeal by the Bank and the delay of 501 days in filing the appeal by the complainant. As the delay in filing the appeal by the bank is only 17 days, the delay is condoned on the grounds mentioned in the application for condonation of delay. There is a huge delay in filing the appeal by the complainant and the reason given by the complainant in the application for condonation of delay is as follows:
“2.    That the impugned order has been passed on 27.03.2014 and the copy of the same was prepared and delivered on 15.04.2014, hence, there is delay of 498 days in filing the accompanying appeal, filed on 24.09.2015.
3.     That it is relevant to state that the appellant is citizen of UK and is at present 76 years old. The appellant suffered various ailments due to which he had to remain under treatment for number of days and it is only after recovering, he could visit India only in February – March 2015, for the purposes of marriages of poor girls at Baba Nanki Gurudawara at Sultanpur, Kaputhala. It is only in the month of June 2015, the appellant again visited India for the present matter and copy of his passport is attached as Annexure A - 2. The copy of the medical record is Annexure A 3 received through e-mail in last week of August 2015 and Annexure A 1, received in September 2015, whereby reasons for delay in filing of the present appeal can be verified and thereafter the present appeal is being filed without any further delay on 24.09.2015.”
7.     From the above, it is clear that the complainant had received the order in time,  however, the complainant did not take any action to prefer an appeal. Even the complainant was in India in the month of February and March 2015, however, he did not file the appeal. When he again visited India in the month of June 2015, even then the appeal was not filed. It is stated that the medical record was received by e-mail in September 2015, thereafter the appeal was filed on 28.09.2015. Thus, it is clear that if the complainant had taken decision to file an appeal he should have brought the medical record along with him and the delay in getting the medical records on e-mail is not a proper reason for condoning the delay. It seems that the complainant has filed this appeal to counter the appeal filed by the opposite party Bank. The special periods of limitation have been prescribed in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for speedy disposal of consumer disputes. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, IV (2011) CPJ 63 (SC), wherein the Apex Court has highlighted the object of Consumer Protection Act particularly expeditious and in expensive remedy to the consumers.
“It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this Court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the Consumer Foras”.
8.         The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of R.B. Ramlingam Vs. R.B. Bhavaneshwari, 2009 (2) Scale 108, it has been observed:
“We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
","9.     The above authoritative judgments are fully applicable in appeal no. 781 of 2015, clearly the appellant/ complainant has not shown reasonable diligence in pursuing his appeal. Accordingly no case is made out for condoning the huge delay of 501 days as examined above. Consequently, the application for condonation of delay is dismissed.
10 .  Now coming to the merit, there was a nominee already mentioned in the FDRs and therefore until the death certificate of the nominee was submitted to the Bank it was not possible for the bank to initiate proceedings to give the amount of FDRs to any other LR. Moreover, in India, succession certificate from a Civil Judge/ District Judge is required for the release of the amount of FDs where no nominee is mentioned or where the nominee has also expired. Thus, the bank was initially right in proceeding on these lines. However, the present complainant/ LR presented copy of the Letter of Administration from the High Court of England but the same was not the original copy. The complainant was duty bound and responsible to submit the original copy to the Bank, as it is mentioned on the first page of this Letter of Administration that the Grant is not valid unless it bears the impressed seal of the Court. When the complaint was filed, the Bank in their written statement had mentioned that the proceedings of the FDRs could not be released to the complainant as the original letter of Administration was not submitted by the complainant. Once the original Letter of Administration was filed with the Bank, the bank released the amount to the complainant. Thus, there seems to be no deficiency on the part of the Bank.
11.   The State Commission has observed that as per Section 82 of the Evidence Act, the bank should have acted on the photocopy of the Letter of Administration and therefore, the State Commission has attributed deficiency on the part of the Bank. I am not in agreement with the observation of the State Commission because, the document itself mentions that the copy of this grant is not valid without the impressed seal of the court and therefore, in this situation, Section 82 of the Evidence Act may not be applicable in respect of this document and moreover, nobody would like to take any risk by accepting this document without the impressed seal of the Court when it is fore-warned to act on this document when there is impressed seal on the document. Moreover, this was a matter of release of huge amount and therefore, the Bank was justified in taking greater precaution than in non-money matters. Accordingly, I do not find any substance in the observation of the State Commission that the Bank was deficient in service.
12.   Coming to the assertion of the learned counsel for the complainant that compensation for air tickets should also be given to the complainant as he had come to India from England 3-4 times only for this purpose, it is not clear from the case file as to why the complainant had to come 3-4 times from England to India and why the work could not be finished during one visit. If there were various requirements from the Bank, the same could have been managed within one visit. It was open to the complainant to complete the formalities during one visit, or to go and come back again. As would be clear from the application for condonation of delay, that the complainant used to come to India for his other engagements/ obligations, it cannot be said that the complainant came to India 3-4 times only for release of amount of FDRs. The State Commission has also not found any substance in the demand of the complainant and I also agree with the same. Moreover, Section 14 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, clearly provides that the compensation should be for the injury and loss suffered by the complainant due to negligence by the opposite party. In the present case, as observed above, that there was no negligence on the part of the bank, hence, there should be no question of any compensation to the complainant.
13.   Based on the above discussion, the First Appeal no.337 of 2014 filed by the Bank is accepted and the order of the State Commission dated 27.03.2014 in respect of award of Rs.2.00 lakh as compensation is set aside. However, I do not find any merit in the First Appeal no. 781 of 2015 and the same is dismissed on the ground of limitation as well as on merit.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Abhishek Kumar, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :For the Respondent No. 1       :   NEMO
For the Respondent No. 2       :   Mr. Kunal Chatterjee, Advocate 
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner/OP-1, New India Assurance Company Ltd. against the order dated 14.07.2016 passed in First Appeal No. 382 of 2009 by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, West Bengal, Kolkata (For short, State Commission’) wherein the appeal filed by the petitioner herein has been dismissed and the order of the District Forum has been upheld.
2.       Brief facts of the case are that respondent no.1/complainant, Smt. Kailash Devi had taken an insurance policy styled, “Janta Personal Accident Policy” for sum insured of Rs.1,00,000. During the insurance period, on 14.05.2005, while cutting fodder she was hit by buffalo resulting in injury in the eye.  She was brought to the concerned PHC and later on to Nayandeep Eye Research Centre on 15.05.2005 and was discharged on 16.05.2005.  Inspite of treatment, her left eye was removed. The insurance claim was filed by the complainant /respondent no.1 which was not settled by the OPs. Hence, the case was filed before the District Forum.  The District Forum vide its order dated 20.08.2009 has allowed the claim of Rs.50,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 9% per annum as well as Rs.1,000/- towards litigation cost.
3.       Being aggrieved, petitioner preferred First Appeal No. 382 of 2009 before the State Commission which was dismissed vide order dated 14.07.2016.
4.       Hence, the present revision petition.
5.       Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at the admission stage. Learned counsel for respondent no. 2 was also present & heard.  Notice was not served to respondent No.1/complainant and the same was dispensed with in the light of order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in a similar matter where the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 25.11.2016 in SLP no.7732 of 2016  New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. Sugiya Devi and another, has  already observed that it is not necessary to serve the complainant and the Insurance Company to deposit the amount with the District Forum. Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the respondent no.1 was in no way connected with respondent no. 2. Claimant is not an employee of respondent no. 2 & has not filed any proof of agency license/investment certificate/office staff of respondent no. 2. Both the fora below have passed erroneous orders without looking at the objections filled by the petitioner insurance company.  It has been further argued that this Commission vide order dated 27.11.2015 in cases involving the similar policy and respondent no.2/GTFS, being the Revision Petition No.3095/2010 as lead case, has held that respondent no.2/GTFS is also negligent, besides holding the Insurance Company liable towards the payment of claim.  This Commission has also made the liability as joint and several stating as under:
“We are convinced that these are cases of composite negligence on the part of the Insurance Company and GTFS.  It is on account of this composite negligence that the nominees of the insured are suffering.  Nevertheless, at this juncture, we do not have sufficient evidence on record to determine the extent of negligence on the part of GTFS so as to bifurcate amounts payable under the policies.  Therefore, under the circumstances, we hold that liability to pay the amounts in terms of the order passed by the fora below, to the complainants before us will be joint and several on the Insurance Company and GTFS.  It will be open to the complainants to enforce the orders in their favour against both or any of them.”
6.       The learned counsel emphasized that on this basis, the order may be passed in the present revision petition also. The learned counsel further stated that there has been a delay of 43 days in filing this revision petition and this delay has happened due to time taken in obtaining legal advice and obtaining higher orders for filing the revision petition.  The delay is nominal and inadvertent.  It was requested to condone this delay and to decide the revision petition on merit.
7.       On the other hand, it was stated by learned counsel for respondent no.2 that there is no question of ordering any joint liability of the respondent No.2 because neither the District Forum nor the State Commission has found respondent No.2 deficient in service.  The concurrent finding of the fora below are based on the facts of the case and against the concurrent finding of facts by the fora below, the scope under the revision petition is quite limited and facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission. In a matter with similar facts, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 25.11.2016 in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. Sugiya Devi and another has ordered the total insurance amount to be deposited by the insurance company before the District Forum and the same would be released to the complainant by the District Forum without asking for any security. Therefore nothing remains pending in this revision petition as the same may be disposed of by ordering the insurance company to deposit the insurance amount before the District Forum and the same should be released in favour of complainant/respondent no.1 by the District Forum.  The learned counsel also stated that the revision petition has been filed with delay, hence, the same may be dismissed on this count.
8.       I have carefully perused the record and have considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties.  First of all, it is seen that there is a delay of 43 days in filing the present revision petition.  As the delay is only of 43 days and being a government undertaking, it has to undergo legal consultation as public money is involved, before finally taking a decision for filing the revision, I deem it appropriate to condone the delay in the light of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Manoharan Vs. Sivarajan & Ors, Civil Appeal No.10581 of 2013, decided on 25.11.2013 (SC) wherein the following has been observed:-
“9. In the case of State of Bihar & Ors. v. Kameshwar Prasad Singh & Anr., it was held that power to condone the delay in approaching the Court has been conferred upon the Courts to enable them to do substantial justice to parties by disposing the cases on merit. The relevant paragraphs of the case read as under:
“11. Power to condone the delay in approaching the Court has been conferred upon the Courts to enable    them to do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on merits. This Court in Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag v. Mst. Katiji (1987)ILLJ 500 SC held that the expression 'sufficient cause' employed by the legislature in the Limitation Act is adequately elastic to enable the Courts to apply the law in a meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice-that being the life purpose for the existence of the institution of Courts. It was further observed that a liberal approach is adopted on principle as it is realised that:
1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the parties.
3. 'Every day's delay must be explained' does not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or  on  account  of  culpable  negligence,  or  on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.”
9.       It is also seen that the fora below have given concurrent finding of facts that the complainant had obtained Janta Personal Accident policy from the petitioner Insurance Company and that she suffered loss of one eye resulting in the claim.  Both the fora below have also given concurrent finding on the fact that the insurance policy was issued by the New India Assurance Company Ltd. and not by the respondent No.2 as alleged by the petitioner herein.  In this regard, the following observations of the District Forum are important:-
“5.          The contention of GTFS is that policy has been issued by the insurance company whereas insurance company has alleged that the policy has been issued by GTFS.  Policy itself shows that policy is issued by insurance company.  Opposite party have tried to shift their liability upon each other.  As per M.O.U. insurance company is liable for effective operation of scheme and GTFS was entitled to collect the premium and remit the same to the insurance company.  GTFS has filed list of insurance persons sent to insurance company in which name of the complainant is mentioned.
Further premium has been made to the insurance company on 01.03.2000.  Subsequent to which policy has been received by the opposite party no.1 which is also to confirm from facts that the signature found on policy and on MOU are same and they have been made on behalf of New India Insurance Company.     …………….. …………………………………………”
6. On consideration of material placed on record and arguments advanced on behalf of the parties.  This court finds that premium was collected by GTFS and remit to the insurance company subsequently to which policy has been issued by opposite party no.2 as per policy the complainant is entitled for the claim amount of Rs.50,000/- along with interest…………….”
10.     In these circumstances, this Commission cannot take an independent view on facts contrary to the concurrent findings of the fora below.  In taking this view, I am supported by the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286, wherein, the following has been held:
“23.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
11.     In fact, no legal issue has been raised in the present revision petition and the facts have been decided by the fora below against which this Commission cannot make any reassessment and therefore, there seems to be no opportunity to interfere with the concurrent orders passed by the fora below.  Otherwise also, the amount involved in the present case is not a substantial amount for a Government Insurance Company which justifies further litigation despite concurrent decisions of the fora below against the petitioner Insurance Company.  In taking this view, I am supported by the following observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Gurgaon Gramin Bank Vs. Khazani & Anr., IV (2012) CPJ 5 (SC):-
""2.  Number of litigations in our country is on the rise, for small and trivial matters, people and sometimes Central and State Governments and their instrumentalities Banks, nationalized or private, come to courts may be due to ego clash or to save the Officers’ skin. Judicial system is over-burdened, naturally causes delay in adjudication of disputes. Mediation centers opened in various parts of our country have, to some extent, eased the burden of the courts but we are still in the tunnel and the light is far away. On more than one occasion, this court has reminded the Central Government, State Governments and other instrumentalities as well as to the various banking institutions to take earnest efforts to resolve the disputes at their end. At times, some give and take attitude should be adopted or both will sink. Unless, serious questions of law of general importance arise for consideration or a question which affects large number of persons or the stakes are very high, Courts jurisdiction cannot be invoked for resolution of small and trivial matters. We are really disturbed by the manner in which those types of matters are being brought to courts even at the level of Supreme Court of India and this case falls in that category.”
The Apex Court further held;
“10. The Chief Manager stated in the affidavit that no bill was raised by the counsel for the bank for conducting the matter before the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. We have not been told how much money has been spent by the bank officers for their to and fro journeys to the lawyers’ office, to the District Forum, State Forum, National Commission and, to the Supreme Court. For a paltry amount of ₹15,000/-even according to the affidavit, bank has already spent a total amount of ₹12,950/- leaving aside the time spent and other miscellaneous expenses spent by the officers of the bank for to and fro expenses etc. Further, it may be noted that the District Forum had awarded ₹3,000/-towards cost of litigation and compensation for the harassment caused to Smt. Khazani. Adding this amount, the cost goes up to ₹15,950/-. Remember, the buffalo had died 10 years back, but the litigation is not over, fight is still on for ₹15,000/-.
11. Learned counsel appearing for the bank, Shri Amit Grover, submitted that though the amount involved is not very high but the claim was fake and on inspection by the insurance company, no tag was found on the dead body of the buffalo and hence the insurer was not bound to make good the loss, consequently the bank had to proceed against Smt. Khazani.
12. We are of the view that issues raised before us are purely questions of facts examined by the three forums including the National Disputes Redressal Commission and we fail to see what is the important question of law to be decided by the Supreme Court. In our view, these types of litigation should be discouraged and message should also go, otherwise for all trivial and silly matters people will rush to this court.
13.  Gramin Bank like the appellant should stand for the benefit of the gramins who sometimes avail of loan for buying buffaloes, to purchase agricultural implements, manure, seeds and so on. Repayment, to a large extent, depends upon the income which they get out of that. Crop failure, due to drought or natural calamities, disease to cattle or their death may cause difficulties to gramins to repay the amount. Rather than coming to their rescue, banks often drive them to litigation leading them extreme penury. Assuming that the bank is right, but once an authority like District Forum takes a view, the bank should graciously accept it rather than going in for further litigation and even to the level of Supreme Court. Driving poor gramins to various litigative forums should be strongly deprecated because they have also to spend large amounts for conducting litigation. We condemn this type of practice, unless the stake is very high or the matter affects large number of persons or affects a general policy of the Bank which has far reaching consequences.
","14.  We, in this case, find no error in the decisions taken by all fact finding authorities including the National Disputes Redressal Commission. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with cost of ₹10,000/- to be paid by the bank to the first respondent within a period of one month. Resultantly, the Bank now has to spend altogether ₹25,950/- for a claim of ₹15,000/-, apart from to and fro travelling expenses of the Bank officials. Let God save the Gramins.”
12.     Based on the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 14.07.2016 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Consequently, revision petition No.3596 of 2016 is dismissed.

","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Dr. Ajay Kumar against the order dated 13.03.2014 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Bihar, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal Nos.37 & 70 of 2008.
2.      Brief facts of the case as mentioned in the order of the State Commission are that the complainant Smt. Indu Bala Mishra filed a complaint case in the concerned District Forum against the appellant- Dr. Ajay Kumar, Palm View Hospital, Patna with allegation of deficiency in service in providing medical services to her husband late Shri S.N. Mishra, due to which it caused death to the patient who went to opposite party doctor for the purpose of treatment at Palm View Hospital on 26.7.2003, with a complain of burning sensation while passing urine.  The appellant/opposite party doctor after examining the patient and after conduction of different tests, suggested surgery of prostate of Sri S.N.Mishra.  The patient was operated on 30.7.2003 at the said hospital by the appellant/opposite party Dr. Ajay Kumar.  The patient was discharged from the Hospital on 4.8.2003 with some instructions regarding precautions to be followed by the patient and with advice to report for follow up in one month.  But, just after the operation, the condition of the patient started deteriorating day-by-day and some other complications developed.  The patient was again brought and admitted in the same Palm View Hospital on 15.8.2003 and he was advised to consult a psychiatrist.  But, as per the complainant, when no proper hospital services were rendered to the patient by the opposite party doctor, the patient was brought to PMCH in an unconscious state and was admitted on 16.8.2003 in Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, Patna where the patient died on 17.8.2003.
3.      The complainant then filed a consumer complaint bearing no.382 of 2003 before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Patna, (in short ‘the District Forum).  The complaint was resisted by the opposite party by filing the written statement before the District Forum.  The District Forum after hearing both the parties allowed the complaint and directed the opposite party to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation and Rs.5000/- as cost of litigation.
4.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the complainant as well as the opposite party both filed appeals bearing No.37 & 70 of 2008 respectively.  The State Commission dismissed the appeal bearing No.70 of 2008 filed by Dr. Ajay Kumar and allowed the appeal No.37 of 2008 filed by the complainant by enhancing the compensation from Rs.1,00,000/- to Rs.5,00,000/- and also directed to pay litigation cost of Rs.10,000/-.
5.       Hence the present revision petition.
6.       Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that District Forum had not given any opportunity to any of the parties to file evidence. Though the proceedings before the District Forum are called summary proceedings, however, this does not mean that the procedure laid down in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 can be ignored.  In fact, the District Forum has based its decision on the two reports filed by the complainant as expert reports of two doctors. One of the doctors is son-in-law of the complainant and other is a friend doctor who is working as Junior doctor in U.K.  The District Forum had asked to produce the registration number of these doctors and the same were not produced by the complainant.  None of these doctors have any knowledge about urology and none of them is a urologist. Only a specialist on the subject matter can give an expert opinion.  Thus, the expert opinions submitted by the complainant are of no value. In support of his argument, learned counsel referred to the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Chandra Agrawal Vs. Regency Hospital Limited & Ors., (2009) 9 SCC 709, wherein the following has been observed:-
“EXPERT OPINION:
16.  The law of evidence is designed to ensure that the court considers only that evidence which will enable it to reach a reliable conclusion. The first and foremost requirement for an expert evidence to be admissible is that it is necessary to hear the expert evidence. The test is that the matter is outside the knowledge and experience of the lay person. Thus, there is a need to hear an expert opinion where there is a medical issue to be settled. The scientific question involved is assumed to be not within the court's knowledge. Thus cases where the science involved, is highly specialized and perhaps even esoteric, the central role of expert cannot be disputed. The other requirements for the admissibility of expert evidence are:
i) that the expert must be within a recognized field of expertise
ii) that the evidence must be based on reliable principles, and
iii) that the expert must be qualified in that discipline.”
7.      It was further stated by the learned counsel that the opposite party had filed an application before the District Forum to take expert opinion in the matter under Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  The District Forum did not order to take expert opinion on the subject and passed the final order. In a medical negligence case, it is necessary to give opportunity to both the parties for filing their evidence.  As proof of burden lies on the complainant to prove medical negligence, the complainant was required to file evidence and once the evidence was filed by the complainant, the opposite party should have also been allowed to file their evidence.  The District Forum has not proceeded as per the provision of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Hence, the proceeding before the District Forum is totally illegal and should be quashed. In respect of his arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the following judgments:-
1.  Mathura Mahto Mistry Vs. Bindeshwar Jha (Dr.) & Anr., I (2008) CPJ 109 (NC).  It has been held that:-
“4. Disposing of the complaint, especially in a case of medical negligence, without directing the parties to file evidence by way of affidavits, illegality is writ large on the face of it. Both the parties obviously did not get an opportunity to prove their respective case, in view of which, we are unable to sustain the order passed by the State Commission, which is set aside and the case is remanded back to the State Commission to give an opportunity to both the parties to lead evidence by way of affidavits as also permit cross-examination, if so requested. The State Commission may also consider obtaining an expert opinion, if so requested by the complainant, and only then pass the orders on merits. Both the parties are directed to appear before the State Commission on 10.12.2007.”
2.     C.P.Sreekumar (Dr.) Vs. S. Ramanujam, II (2009) CPJ 48 (SC).   It has been held that:-
“15.  ….The bald statement of the respondent (in the course of his arguments and in his written submissions) with respect to the lack of expertise in performing the internal fixation procedure on which the appellant had chosen to go in for hemiarthroplasty, cannot thus, be accepted.
16.   …… We find from a reading of the order of the Commission that it proceeded on the basis that whatever had been alleged in the complaint by the respondent was in fact the inviolable truth even though it remained unsupported by any evidence. As already observed in Jacob Mathew's case the onus to prove medical negligence lies largely on the claimant and that this onus can be discharged by leading cogent evidence. A mere averment in a complaint which is denied by the other side can, by no stretch of imagination, be said to be evidence by which the case of the complainant can be said to be proved. It is the obligation of the complainant to provide the facta probanda as well as the facta probantia.”
8.    Learned counsel further stated that this is a pure question of law that can be raised at any stage.  It was accepted by the learned counsel that the issue of evidence was not raised before the State Commission in appeal, however, when the State Commission has increased the amount of compensation five folds, this issue has become more important for being raised before this Commission.  In support of his argument, learned counsel referred to the following judgment:-
1.      Seth Badri Prasad and Ors. Vs. Seth Nagannal and ors., 1959 Supp (1) SCR 769.  It has been held that:-
","“8.   We proceed now to consider these contentions of learned counsel for the appellants.  The first contention that Respondent 1 should not be allowed to raise an objection of the kind which he has now raised at this late stage can be disposed of very easily.  The objection taken rests on the provisions of a public statue which no court can exclude from its consideration.  The question is a pure question of law and does not require the investigation of any facts….”
2.      Hero Vinoth (minor) Vs. Seshammal, (2206) 5 SCC 545.  It has been held that:-
“15. In Neelakantan and Ors. v. Mallika Begum (2002 (2) SCC it was held that findings of fact recorded must be set aside where the finding has no basis in any legal evidence on record or is based on a misreading of evidence or suffers from any legal infirmity which materially prejudices the case of one of the parties.”
9.      Apart from the issue of evidence, the learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the patient was all right for about 11 days after the operation of prostate. On 11th day, the patient was admitted in the hospital, however, he was shifted on same day to other hospital.  The respondent had not filed any medical treatment record of the other hospital.  When the patient was all right for 11 days after operation and no complication developed during that period, it cannot be said that there was any fault in the operation of prostate.  In fact, the cause of death mentioned in the death certificate is the cardiac arrest due to ventricular failure.  The cardiac arrest has nothing to do with the operation of prostrate and the respondent is trying to extract money from the hospital and the doctor.
10.    Learned counsel for the petitioner has filed all the daily order sheets of the District Forum and has shown that at no point of time the District Forum fixed date for filing evidence.  Thus, the District Forum has clearly violated the procedure given in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
11.    On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that though the patient was discharged after operation, however, the patient was not in good health and his condition slowly and slowly deteriorated from the date of discharge.  Though, the patient was asked to come after 20 days, however, he was taken to the opposite party hospital just after 10 days as the condition of the patient was deteriorating.  Whatever complications developed in the patient, they were due to the operation of the prostate and the two experts have given their report opinion confirming the allegation of the complainant.  The District Forum has rightly relied on these reports. The complainant has had to file the appeal against the order of the District Forum as the District Forum had granted very meagre compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-.  It was argued by the learned counsel that these reports were filed as evidence before the District Forum and the opposite party also filed CD of the operation before the District Forum, therefore, it cannot be said that the parties did not file evidence before the District Forum.
12.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and have examined the material on record. It is seen from the daily order sheets filed by the petitioner that the District Forum has not given any date for filing the evidence. After filing of the written statement, the matter was listed for hearing and after many dates of hearing the complainant filed two expert reports and the opposite party filed CD of operation.   Though, these may be considered as evidence filed by the complainant and opposite party respectively, however, this evidence may not be sufficient to decide the medical negligence case.  The responsibility of proving medical negligence lies on the complainant and no evidence by way of affidavit has been filed by complainant or by the opposite party in this case. Clearly, the District Forum has not observed the procedure given in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for deciding the complaint. It is also seen that there is also a force in the arguments of the learned counsel for the complainant that no objection was raised by the petitioner before the District Forum or before the State Commission that due procedure had not been followed and no opportunity has been granted for adducing evidence.  After decision by two fora below, the petitioner is raising this question at the stage of revision petition.  Learned counsel for the petitioner also admitted that in the appeal before the State Commission, the question of evidence was not raised.  I also agree with the contention of the petitioner that the legal point can be raised at any stage, however, by not raising this point before the appropriate forum, District Forum or the State Commission, the delay in disposal of the complaint as per law has been caused by the petitioner.  Clearly, if the procedure has not been followed an opportunity is required to be granted to both the parties for producing evidence. The order passed by the District Forum suffers from material irregularity consequently, the order passed by the State Commission also suffers from material irregularity.  In such situation, orders of the fora below cannot be sustained.  The matter needs to be remanded to the District Forum for deciding complaint after giving opportunity to both the parties for filing evidence in support of their case.  The complainant needs to be suitably compensated for the delay caused by the petitioner by not raising this issue of evidence at the appropriate time before the District Forum or the State Commission.
13.    Based on the above discussion, the revision petition 551-552 of 2019 is allowed and the order of the State Commission dated  13.3.2014 and the order dated 30.11.2007 of the District Forum are set aside and the matter is remanded to the District Forum for giving opportunity to both the parties for filing the evidence and then decide the complaint following procedure given in Section 13 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 at a cost of Rs.60,000/- (rupees sixty thousand only) to be paid to the respondent/complainant by the petitioner by way of demand draft on or before the next date of appearance before the District Forum.  The District Forum shall proceed with the case after the cost has been paid by the petitioner to the complainant.  The District Forum shall be empowered to extend the period of payment if it is absolutely necessary upto a period of 30 days and if the cost is not paid, the order of the State Commission shall become effective.  Parties to appear before the District Forum on 14.04.2020.  As the original complainant has expired, the cost of Rs.60,000/- (rupees sixty thousand only) should be given to the LRs of the complainant. If there is any dispute among the LRs over this cost, the District Forum shall sort it out.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Mithilesh Sinha, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :NONE 
","The present Revision Petition under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) has been filed challenging the order dated 03.04.2018 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U.P., Lucknow (for shot “the State Commission”) in Appeal No.314 of 2017 of the Petitioner against the order dated 27.12.2016 of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Jhansi (for short “the District Forum”) whereby the District Forum had allowed the Complaint           Case No.58/ 2012 of the Respondent.
2)       Brief facts of the case are that the husband of the Respondent No.1 was an agriculturist having its agricultural land in Village Riya, Thana Earach, District Jhansi and his name was also entered in the Khatauni of Village.  The Government of U.P., for the benefits of its farmers formulated a welfare scheme.  Pursuant to that, they had entered into an agreement with the petitioner on 19.11.2009.  As per Clause 2 of the said Policy, all the farmers for age group 12 to 70, both inclusive, whose names appear in the Khatauni records of the State of Uttar Pradesh as the owner of the agricultural land in the State U.P. automatically got covered under the said Policy.  The said Policy was valid for one year i.e. from 19th November, 2009 onwards.  The deceased Mangal Singh died in a fight with some persons on 17.11.2010.  The FIR was registered.  A claim was filed claiming benefits under the said policy.  A complaint was also filed before the District Forum claiming benefits under the said Policy.
3)       In the Written Statement, the petitioner has not denied the facts that deceased was an agriculturist and was covered under the said policy.  It is also submitted that he has died due to personal enmity and not accidentally and, therefore, petitioner was not liable to pay compensation.  It was contended that the Policy had expired and was not valid on the date of accident.  Therefore, nothing was payable under that Policy.
4)       The District Forum after hearing the parties held that deceased Mangal Singh had died in an accident and was covered under the said Policy of the Government and thereafter issued following direction:-
“Consumer Complaint of the complainant is allowed and opposite party is directed to pay Rs.1,00,000/- with interest @ 12 % p.a. to the complainant.  This amount of interest shall be payable from the date of filing Consumer Complaint till actual payment.  Rs.2,500/- (Rupees two thousand five hundred only) towards mental pain and agony and Rs.2,500 (Rupees two thousand five hundred only) for the cost of the case are also payable.”
5)       This order was impugned by the petitioner in an appeal before the State Commission and the State Commission while dismissing the appeal has held as under:-
“Indisputably the policy in question has been issued by appellant Insurance Company in pursuance of M.O.U. signed by appellant Insurance Company and Government of State of U.P.  The M.O.U. has been signed by appellant Insurance Company and Government for providing insurance policy for the period extending from 19.11.2009 to 18.11.2010.  In case of any default in payment of premium by State Government, the appellant Insurance Company was at liberty to repudiate contract.  But when appellant Insurance Company has opted to perform the contract, the contract shall be performed as it is without any unilateral modification.  In case of short payment of premium by State Government, the Insurance Company may recover it from State Government in accordance with law but it cannot reduce period of policy unilaterally.
In view of discussion made above appellant Insurance Company is bound by M.O.U. and in view of M.O.U. the policy was effective on the date of death of husband of respondent/ complainant.
In view of discussion made above the District Consumer Forum has rightly ordered appellant Insurance Company to pay insured amount of policy to respondent/ complainant.
For the reasons recorded above we find no sufficient ground for any interference in impugned judgement.
","The appeal is dismissed.”
6)       This order is impugned before me in this Revision Petition.  The only contention raised by the ld. Counsel is that the said Policy had expired, since the Government who exercised the option to pay the premium defaulted in paying the installment.  The said MoU therefore was not valid and there was no valid insurance policy in favour of any of the beneficiary under the said MoU on the date on which beneficiary Mangal Singh had died.  It is also argued that the Government of U.P. had also failed to comply with Section 64 VB of the Insurance Act.
7)       I have heard the arguments and perused all the records.  Undisputedly, the deceased was a beneficiary under the MoU executed between the Govt. of U.P. and the petitioner pursuant to a Welfare Policy called Janata Personal Accident Policy.  This agreement was executed on 19.11.2009.  Clause 2 of the said Policy reads as under:-
“This is an unnamed policy and all farmers in the age group of 12 to 70 years, both inclusive, whose names appear in the Khatauni records of the State of Uttar Pradesh as the owner of agricultural land in the state of Uttar Pradesh shall be covered under this policy, without any selection, if a farmer attains 12 years of age on any date during the currency of policy period, he/she will be deemed to be covered from such date.  But if a farmer crosses 70 years of age during the tenure of this policy, he/she will also remain covered till the end of the policy period.”
8)       This clause clearly shows that the insurer is Govt. of U.P., hence the deceased was beneficiary as per JPA Policy.  This further confirms that this policy was for the welfare of the unnamed farmers and was automatically covering all those farmers of the State of U.P. who own agricultural land and whose names were recorded in the Khatauni records of State of U.P. and are between the age group of 12 to 70.
9)       There is no dispute that the deceased was the farmer who is the owner of agricultural land in the State of U.P. and his name also appeared in the Khatauni records of State of U.P.  He, therefore, was automatically covered under the said Policy.  Clause 3 of the said agreement reads as under:-
“The JPA policy period shall be for one year from 19th November, 2009.”
10)     The validity of the said Policy was therefore till 18.11.2010.  The deceased, died on 17.11.2010 i.e. during the validity of the JPA Policy.  The beneficiary, therefore, needs to be paid under the said Policy.  The Insurance Company, the petitioner can put his claim if the executor of this agreement has violated any terms and conditions of this MoU.
11)     I found no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.  The present Revision Petition is dismissed with no order as costs.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Ajit Nair, Advocate
                                    Mr. Manas Raghuvanshi, Advocate 
","1.      This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Manager DTDC express limited challenging the order dated 21st  August 2017 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, West Bengal (in short ‘the State Commission’) in First Appeal No.A/ 638/2016.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant had booked a consignment for delivery to Guwahati from Kolkata on 4th March 2014 which was to be delivered on 8th March 2014. However the consignment was not delivered to the consignee till the stipulated time. The complainant pursued with the opposite party however no response was there and therefore the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum being CC number 612/2014. The complaint was contested by the opposite party by filing the written statement in which it was mainly alleged that the complainant had given incomplete postal address and therefore it was not possible for the opposite party to find out the address of the consignee. However the District Forum partly allowed the complaint and directed the opposite parties to pay rupees 10,000/- to the complainant for mental harassment and rupees 1000/-  towards the cost of litigation within one month from the date of this order failing which OPs will pay 9% per annum interest.
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum dated 30th June 2016 the complainant as well as the opposite party filed the appeals before the State Commission. The State Commission vide impugned order dated 21st August 2017 dismissed the appeal of the opposite party and allowed the appeal filed by the complainant as under :-
“The Appeals are accordingly disposed of.
Hence,
That A/638/2016 A/703/2016 be and the same are dismissed and allowed on contest, respectively.  The impugned order is modified as under:
The OPs shall pay the entire cost of goods, i.e., Rs.60,676/- to the complainant together with compensation for a sum of Rs.20,000/- and litigation cost amounting to Rs.1,000/- within 45 days hence. In default, OPs shall be liable to pay simple interest @9% on Rs.60,676/- from the date of filing of the complaint, i.e., 11-11-2014 till full and final payment is made.”
4.      Hence the present revision petition.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for both the sides and perused the record. Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that when the consignment was being booked it was suggested by the counterperson to take insurance for the consignment however, no insurance was taken and the consignment was booked under D series. It is mentioned on the receipt that for every consignment the liability of the petitioner will only be up to rupees 5,000. Therefore the petitioner cannot be burdened with more compensation than the liability arising out of the contract between the parties. Moreover, the petitioner is not concerned with the valuation of the consignment if no insurance premium is paid. If a person is sending valuable item, then precaution should be taken to send the same by obtaining the insurance cover as well. Otherwise for normal items, the liability is up to rupees 5,000/- only as mentioned in the receipt which forms the contract between the two parties.
6.      It was further argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that as alleged, the consignment consisted of a makeup kit which was sold by the complainant to the consignee and the transaction was of commercial nature and the service of the petitioner was availed for commercial purpose. Consequently the complainant is not a consumer under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986.
7.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant stated that the complainant has not done any commercial business with the petitioner and it was a sale to the consignee by the complainant who is running this business for earning her livelihood by means of self-employment. Since, State Commission has already dealt with this issue and has reached to the conclusion that this was not a commercial transaction and it was only an availment of courier service which is covered under Section 2(1) (o) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986.
8.      It was further argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that though it has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complainant was suggested to take insurance, however, no such letter or any proof has been filed by the petitioner to prove the same. Hence no value can be attached to this assertion of the petitioner.
9.      With respect to the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner about the limited liability of the petitioner, the learned counsel for the complainant stated that this issue has been examined by the State Commission and it has been concluded that mere printing of a specific liability clause does not constitute any conscious agreement between the parties and therefore the argument of limited liability has not been accepted by the State Commission. In support of his argument, the learned counsel referred to the judgment of this Commission in Roadwings International Vs. Hindustan Copper Limited & anr., III (1999) CPJ 23 (NC) wherein it has been observed:-
“9. The plea taken on behalf of the appellant that there was a specific contract to oust his liability as a common carrier is not acceptable in the facts of the case. The owner of goods did not enter into any specific contract in writing with the appellant as required in Section 6 of the Act. The contention of the appellant is that there is a printed Terms and Conditions of the carriage. These Terms and Conditions were binding on the owner of the goods. But, from what has been produced before us we do not find any signature of the owner in the document containing terms and conditions of the carriage of goods. It will be wrong to presume that the owner had consented to these terms and conditions before the delivery of the goods to the common carrier. Condition mentioned in a goods receipt issued by the carrier but not signed by the owner cannot constitute a special contract contemplated by Section 6 of the Act.”
10.    The learned counsel for the complainant also referred to the judgment of this Commission in Air Star Express Courier Vs. Inder Medical Store & anr., II (2012) CPJ 167 (NC) wherein it has been observed:-
“7.   Counsel for the petitioner then invited our attention to Clause 2 of the terms and conditions printed on the receipt which provides that “this Company limits its liability to a maximum of Rs.100 per consignment in any case”.  That the petitioner’s liability is limited and the petitioner is not liable to pay more than Rs.100 for the loss of consignment.  We do not find any substance in this submission.  Written statement filed by the petitioner before the District Forum has not been placed on record.  From the order of the District Forum, it appears that in the written statement petitioner had nowhere stated that the liability of the petitioner was limited to Rs.100 only.  We are not sure whether the receipt now shown to us was produced in evidence before the District Forum.  Otherwise also, this point has neither been considered or decided either by the District Forum or the State Commission.  Under these circumstances, the plea now taken by the petitioner that liability was limited to Rs.100 only, cannot be accepted.”
11.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and have examined the material on record. District Forum in its order has mentioned the following:-
“We are satisfied that the complainant is able to prove that the deficiency in service of the O.Ps.  Under such circumstances, we find it is a fit case wherein the complainant deserves the compensation and litigation cost because that the consignee has already received the goods.”
12.    From the above, it seems that the District Forum has given a finding that the consignment had reached the consignee though the same may have reached late and that is why the District Forum has only allowed the compensation and not ordered the cost of the consignment to be paid. However the State Commission has also awarded the cost of the consignment and has observed as under:-
“The essence of the bone of contention, i.e. non-delivery of consignment is not in dispute.  It appears from the copy of Tax Invoice that the complainant sent goods worth Rs.60,676/- through the OP Courier after paying due service charge for this purpose.  As a carrier, the OP Courier Company was duty bound to ensure safe and timely delivery of the consignment to the addressee, which it could not ensure.  Therefore, there is no reason, why a hapless consumer should bear the brunt of laxity on the part of the service provider for which they charge a consumer through the roof.  Accountability can only be restored if we show zero tolerance towards acts of laxity.  In my considered view that the OP should be held liable to make good every penny of the loss suffered by the complainant.”
13.    The State Commission has mentioned that the non-delivery of the consignment is not in dispute, though the District Forum has given a clear observation that the consignment was received by the consignee. The State Commission has not mentioned whether the State Commission has found the finding of the District Forum as wrong and on what basis. The State commission has also not given any finding that the consignment did not reach the consignee. It is also very strange that the opposite party has also not mentioned in written statement whether the consignment was received by the consignee or not.  Thus, the position in respect of the delivery of the consignment was doubtful and therefore this Commission vide it's order dated 3rd April 2019 gave time to the learned counsel for the petitioner to file any document or any other proof for delivery of the consignment to the consignee. The learned counsel had stated that he will seek instruction in this regard, however, nothing has been filed by the learned counsel for the petitioner and therefore the conclusion needs to be derived that the petitioner does not have any proof to establish that the consignment was delivered to the consignee. The consignment note reads as under:-
“Consignment note for 5 kg & above or 1 kg & above when paired with secure pack in Lite service.”
14.    This is a Consignment note for 5 kg and above or 1 kg and above when paired with secure pack in Lite service. However, no weight is mentioned on this consignment note. There are columns for description of content and value of goods. However all these columns are blank. The column of total value of goods in rupees is also blank. In column number 5 declared value for courier has to be mentioned in rupees, however, the same is also blank.
15.    This consignment note is not signed by the sender though there is a specific space mentioned for the signature of the sender. It is thus clear that the petitioner opposite party has not even completely filled up this consignment note for the reasons best known to them. Had the value been quoted in this consignment note, the delivery persons of the opposite party would have given more attention to the correct delivery of the consignment. It is nowhere mentioned in the consignment note that these columns are to be filled only if insurance is taken. Therefore, in my view, the petitioner has been deficient in completing the consignment memo as per the actuals.  In a similar case where mobile sets of about Rs.8.00 lacs were sent by the same courier but did not reach the consignee, this Commission in Ashish Verma Vs. DTDC Courier & Cargo Limited & Ors., RP No.886 of 2015, decided on 06.8.2018 has observed the following:-
“9.       First of all, the OPs’ policy of liability does not distinguish between envelope containing a letter and a carton weighting heavily like carton of mobiles sets etc.  However, this depends on the policy of the OPs  and they have established that they are liable to pay only Rs.500/- as per that policy. Clearly, there is no insurance taken by the complainant and as per the version of the OPs, even  the risk coverage policy of the OP was not taken by the complainant, though the complainant has stated that he never denied paying for the insurance and whatever money was asked,  he had paid the same and he was under the genuine impression that risk cover was already paid for. So far as the liability of the OPs with respect to loss or misplacement of the two packets is concerned, as per the terms  and conditions that is rightly assessed by both the fora below as Rs.500/- only. But the question of deficiency in service has not been considered  by any of  the fora below. The deficiency is not only in respect of loss of  the packets, however, the deficiency is also in the processing of the  receipt, dispatch and delivery of these packets. It is seen from the booking receipt/risk coverage consignment note that most of the columns are not filled by the OPs and it only mentions five packets.  On the right hand side of this note,  following is  mentioned:
“ 100% money back guarantee.
Use our Assured Second Business Day Delivery Service to place Far & Wide Across the Country”
10.     The OPs have not even returned the fee paid  to the OPs by  the complainant as per this promise when  the items were not delivered. This shows that the OPs are not even honoring their own commitment which is printed on this note. Moreover, it is seen  that in  this booking receipt/Risk Coverage Consignment Note, most of the columns are blank and no details of the packaged boxes  have been given and  the claim column relating to value of box has been  left blank. It is also not  clear that if risk coverage was not there  then why risk coverage note  was issued to the complainant. If this is just the booking receipt,  then why  the amount charged is not mentioned in this document.   It seems that the OPs have not filled up this form completely to avoid their liability in future. So it means that their intentions were not good and their employees may be involved in  the whole incident. Thus, this is clearly an unfair trade practice which has been adopted by the respondents/ OPs and even if this is due to mistake of some employees of the OPs company,  the company would be liable for the same on the principle of vicarious liability. Due to this unfair trade practice, the complainant has suffered and he has not been able to recover the cost of the consignment from the OPs. Thus, the complainant is required to be compensated for this unfair trade practice adopted by the respondents/OPs.  In  the facts and circumstances of the case, I deem it appropriate to allow a compensation of Rs.1 lakh to be paid by the respondents/OPs to the petitioner/complainant  for this unfair trade practice. The total cost of the misplaced consignments cannot be allowed as compensation because the complainant has also been negligent in not getting the form filled up by the OPs with all the details and he also did not check it at the time of booking the consignments. The value of cartons is not proved on the basis of these receipts/risk coverage note.”
16.    On similar lines, in the present case, I deem it appropriate to allow a compensation of Rs.30,000/- (rupees thirty thousand only) along with interest @6% p.a. from the date of filing complaint till actual payment.
17.    Based on the above discussion, the revision petition no.3124 of 2017 is partly allowed and the petitioner is directed to pay Rs.30,000/- along with interest @6% p.a. from the date of filing the complaint till actual payment.  As interest is being awarded, no justification is there for separate compensation of Rs.20,000/- and this part of the State Commission’s order is set aside. Cost of litigations of Rs.1,000/- is enhanced to Rs.5,000/-.  The orders of the fora below stand modified accordingly.  This order be complied by the petitioner/opposite party within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of this order.

","This first appeal has been filed by the appellants Chairman, Shrriram Group of Companies & Ors. against the order dated 10.6.2011 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Andhra Pradesh, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in CC No.36 of 2008.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent became a member of a Chit of Rs.5,00,000/- and he paid Rs.5,000/- as instalment per month. It is the case of the complainant that after paying 34 instalments his membership was terminated by the opposite parties/appellants without any reason and the opposite parties did not accept further instalments. The opposite parties informed that the membership of the complainant was rightly cancelled and the registration department was also informed.  The complainant inquired from the registration department, it was told that there was no cancellation recorded in the registration department.  He then filed the complaint before the State Commission.  The complaint was resisted by the opposite parties/appellants herein.  The State Commission vide its order dated 10.06.2011 directed the opposite parties No.1 to 4 jointly and severally to pay Rs.1,88,015/- to the complainant with interest @9% p.a. from 20.7.2006 till the date of realization together with cost of Rs.10,000/-.
3.      Hence the present appeal.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well as the respondent in person.  Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the respondent was an agent of the appellant company and therefore, he cannot file complaint against the appellants as there is relationship of principal and agent.  An agent cannot file complaint against the principal.  Apart from this, learned counsel stated that the State Commission did not have the pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint as the total amount involved along with interest was not more than Rs.5,00,000/-.  This point was also raised in their written statement, however, the State Commission has not considered the same.  Thus, the order passed by the State Commission is without jurisdiction.
5.      It was further stated by the learned counsel for the appellants that the respondent has written letter to the company that he is ready to pay the amount due on him.  Clearly, there was some amount due on him as agent, which he accepted himself.  Thus, he is not entitled to Rs.1,88,015/-.
6.      On the other hand, respondent in person stated that apart from being agent of the opposite party company, he was also a member of a Chit of Rs.5,00,000/-. After paying 34 instalments his membership was unauthorisedly cancelled  by the opposite parties and at that time an amount of Rs.1,88,015/- was to be refunded by the company.  The complaint has been filed in the capacity of member of a Chit and not as agent of the company.  He further stated that the letter referred to by the learned counsel for the appellants is a forged letter and the original has never been brought before any forum.  Later on, the opposite parties stated that the original was lost.  Neither any amount due on the complainant is mentioned in this letter, nor opposite parties are able to tell any such amount.
","7.      I have given a thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by both the sides and have examined the record.  Learned counsel for the appellants has raised the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction as the amount involved was below Rs.5,00,000/-.  It is seen from the complaint that complainant had demanded more than Rs.20,00,000/-.  Thus, prima facie there was no bar for the State Commission to entertain this complaint, however, the State Commission should have examined this aspect when the same was raised in the written statement filed by the appellants/opposite parties. As the matter has been decided on merits by the State Commission and apparently complaint was filed for an amount more than Rs.20,00,000/-,  I do not see any point to set aside the order of the State Commission on this ground and remand the matter to the State Commission for deciding the complaint afresh because already period of 11 years has passed since the complaint was filed.  It is to be seen whether any injustice has been done to the appellants.  There is no denying the fact that an amount of Rs.1,88,015/- was due to be paid to the complainant by the opposite parties. The opposite parties may dispute this amount on the basis of the letter allegedly written by the complainant for adjusting the amount due on him. The State Commission has recorded that the opposite parties have not been able to tell exact amount that was to be adjusted. The letter on which the opposite parties are relying also does not indicate any such amount.  Moreover, even during the arguments learned counsel for the opposite parties could not tell the amount that was to be adjusted and she stated that this information was not available on record.  The opposite parties must be keeping accounts of all the agents and therefore, they should have been able to clearly tell the amount that was to be adjusted.  On the other hand, letter allegedly written by the complainant has been disputed by the complainant, who states that this a forged letter and the opposite parties have not been able to file the original letter.  Clearly, in these circumstances, it cannot be assumed that there was any amount to be adjusted against Rs.1,88,015/-, which was to be paid to the complainant.  Thus, I do not see any injustice having been done to the opposite parties except the order for the refund of Rs.1,88,015/-, which is actually the money of the complainant.  So, in fact, no injustice has been done to the opposite parties.
8.      Based on the above discussion, I do not see any merit in the First Appeal No.307 of 2011 filed by the appellants.  Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.

","JUSTICE V. K. JAIN (ORAL)
The appellant late Shri Harinarayan Sharma owned plot No.D-69A in Bapunagar, Jaipur. He entered into an agreement with the respondent No.2 Dinesh Kumar Jain, whereunder Dinesh Kumar Jain was to construct residential flats on the aforesaid plot at his own cost. The flats proposed to be constructed by Dinesh Kumar Jain were to be shared between him and late Shri Harinarayan Sharma.
The complainant entered into an agreement with Sh. Dinesh Kumar Jain on 18.4.2014 for purchase of one of the flats proposed to be constructed by Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain for a consideration of Rs.88,50,000/- and made part payment of Rs.1327500/- to him. The construction of the flat having not been completed, he approached the State Commission by way of a consumer complaint impleading the builder Dinesh Kumar Jain as well as the land owner late Shri Harinarayan Sharma as the opposite parties in the complaint.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the appellant who interalia stated in his written version that he had no knowledge of the agreement between the complainant and Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain. He also stated in his written version that no payment was received by him from the complainant and Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain had got his signature on the agreement between him and the complainant without explaining the contents of the document to him, taking advantage of his old age and his weak physical and mental condition.
3.      The builder Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain did not come forward to contest the consumer complaint. The State Commission allowed the consumer complaint against both the opposite parties, i.e. the builder Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain as well as the appellant late Shri Harinarayan Sharma by directing them to refund of Rs.1327500/- to the complainant alongwith 9% interest and compensation quantified at Rs.25,000/-. Being aggrieved, the appellant approached this Commission by way of this appeal.
4.      It is not in dispute that the plot on which construction was proposed to be raised by Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain was owned by the appellant. The agreement executed between the appellant and Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain clearly shows that it was solely for the builder Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain to construct a multistoried building on the plot of the appellant. The agreement also shows that the entire expenditure on the construction was to be incurred by the builder alone without any monetary contribution by the appellant. The agreement also shows that on receiving possession of the plot, the builder was to pay rent equivalent to rent of two houses to the appellant till the construction of the building was completed by him. The entire responsibility to get the property subdivided,  approval of the plans and completion of the construction rested with the builder, without the appellant being in any manner responsible for the same. Both, the builder as well as the appellant could book the units following to their respective shares. A Power of Attorney was also executed by the appellant in favour of the developer. Thus, the appellant had absolutely no role to play in the construction of the building on the plot though the plot on which construction was planned belonged to him. Thus the said agreement was not a Joint Development Agreement.
5.      A perusal of the Agreement to Sell executed with the complainant would show that  it was executed between only two parties to the said agreement, the first being the developer Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain and the second party being the complainant Vijay Kumar Soni. There was no third party to the agreement. It was clearly stated in the agreement that the first party i.e. Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain would construct a multistoried residential complex on Plot No.D-69A owned by the appellant Shri Harinarayan Sharma and he wanted to sell to the complainant, front side of the third floor in the proposed building which he was competent to sell. Under the agreement, it was for Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain to start construction within three months of the execution of the agreement with the complainant. The entire sale consideration was to be paid by the complainant to Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain. No payment to the appellant was envisaged in the said agreement.
6.      Thus, it is evident that not only the responsibility to construct the building on the plot of the appellant was of Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain the entire payment from the complainant was to be received by him alone.
7.      It is an admitted position before me that no payment whatsoever was made by the complainant to the appellant Shri Harinarayan Sharma. As noted earlier, the Agreement to Sell with the complainant was executed only by Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain. Though the said agreement also bears signature of the appellant the said signature does not make him a party to the aforesaid agreement when it was clearly stated in the document that the agreement was executed between Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain as the first party and the complainant Vijay Kumar Soni as the second party. Obviously, the signature of the appellant would have been taken on the agreement on account of his being the owner of the land on which  a building was proposed to be constructed by Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain, in order to ensure transfer of title in the land underneath the proposed flat, to the complainant, which could be done only by the appellant.
8.      Since (i) there is no privity of contract between the complainant and the appellant (ii) no consideration has been received by the appellant from the complainant and (iii) obligation to construct a building in the said plot rested solely with Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain, the complainant, in my opinion, cannot be said to be a consumer of the complainant.
9.      Even otherwise a consumer complaint can be instituted against the seller of the goods or the service provider as the case may be only if there is a defect or deficiency on the part of the seller of the goods or the service provided in the goods sold or the services rendered, as the case may be. Since the construction was to be made solely by Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain, there was no defect or deficiency on the part of the appellant in rendering services to the complainant, even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the complainant was a consumer of both, Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain as well as the appellant Shri Harinarayan Sharma.
10.    The learned counsel for the appellant refers to the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in Mrs. Jaya Bhandari & Ors. Vs. Malhan Builders & Ors. [(2010) 7 AD (Delhi) 683], decided on 25.8.2020. The aforesaid decision in my opinion, has absolutely no application to the present case when no defect or deficiency on the part of the appellant in rendering services to the complainant is even alleged.
","11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeal is allowed and the order of the State Commission, to the extent the said order is directed against the appellant, is set aside. However, the impugned order to the extent it is directed against Shri Dinesh Kumar Jain, is confirmed. The appeal stands disposed of.

IA/940/2015 (C/DELAY OF DELAY)
For the reasons stated in the application, the delay of 23 days in filing the revision petition is condoned. The application stands disposed of.
RP/350/2015
2.      The complainant/petitioner booked a residential flat admeasuring 1110 sq.ft. with the respondent in a project, namely, TDI City at Kundli in District Sonepat of Haryana, making an initial payment of Rs.3 lakh on 26.2.2006 followed by payment of Rs.2,50,000/- on 29.9.2006. The grievance of the complainant is that no allotment was made to him despite the payment which he had already made. He, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking possession of a residential flat in the above-referred project alongwith compensation etc.
2.      The complaint was not resisted by the respondent which did not come forward to file any written version.  The District Forum vide its order dated 30.10.2013 directed the respondent to refund the amount received from the complainant alongwith interest @ 9% p.a.
3.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission  by way of an appeal. Since there was a delay of 275 days in filing the appeal, an application seeking condonation of delay of the said delay was also filed. The appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed by the State Commission as barred by limitation as well as on merits. Being aggrieved, the petitioner/complainant is before this Commission.
4.      As noted earlier, the respondent did not come forward to contest the consumer complaint before the District Forum. Admittedly, the order passed by the District Forum directing refund with interest @ 9% p.a. was also not challenged by the respondent. It was the petitioner alone who challenged the order passed by the District Forum since he wanted possession of the flat and not refund of the amount which he had paid to the respondent.
5.      The learned counsel for the petitioner / complainant states that though the complainant / petitioner was agitating for the possession of the flat, he will be satisfied if the interest awarded by the Fora below is enhanced to the agreed rate of interest @ 12% p.a.
6.      The learned counsel for the complainant / petitioner has drawn my attention to the application which he had submitted for allotment of a residential flat in this project. Clause (c) of the application reads as under:-
“That in the-event, offer of provisional allotment for a residential flat is made after six months, a simple interest @12% per annum shall be paid to me/us for the period beyond six months on the amount paid by me/us from encashment of  application money up to the date the offer of provisional allotment is made.”
7.      It would thus be seen that interest @ 12% p.a. was payable to the complainant / petitioner was payable to the complainant if provisional allotment was made to him after six months and such interest was payable w.e.f. six months after encashment of the application money till the offer of provisional allotment. The same in my view would be the position, if no allotment at all is made. A person who is denied allotment cannot be worse than a person with delayed allotment.
8.      The learned counsel for the respondent has drawn my attention to the letter dated 9.3.2007 sent by them to the complainant which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
“With reference to your registration for a residential flat ""Kingsbury Apartments"", at TDI City Kundli, we invite you to visit us and choose a flat(s) of your choice before March 17th 2007.
In case you opt for a preferential location, i.e. First, Second or Third floor, 5% of basic value will be charged as PLC towards the same, subject to availability. .
Please note that the allottnent of flat(s) shall be done by the Management if we do not receive any request for priority from your side till above mentioned date.”
9.     The submission of the learned counsel is that it was for the complainant to come forward to opt for a flat of his choice. The above-referred letter would show that if the complainant did not come forward to opt for a flat of his choice, the respondent was to make allotment of its own in case no such choice is exercised before 17.3.2007. There is no evidence of any allotment at all having been made to the complainant even after 17.3.2007. Though the learned counsel for the respondent submits that as per the instructions received by her from the respondent, they had made allotment  in the year 2006 itself, there is no evidence on record to substantiate  the said averment, the respondent having not contested the consumer complaint and having not filed any document. The case of the petitioner in the consumer complaint, however, was that no allotment had been made to him. Therefore, it would be difficult to accept at this stage that a specific flat was actually allotted to the complainant in the year 2006 as is submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent.
10.    Since the respondent failed to make any allotment to the complainant, the complainant is entitled either to allotment of a suitable flat in the above-referred project or to the refund of the amount which he had paid to the respondent with interest. The interest awarded by the Fora below requires the respondent to refund the amount received from the complainant with interest @ 9% p.a. The learned counsel for the complainant / petitioner having taken instructions from the complainant / petitioner submits   that the complainant / petitioner now wants refund of the amount which he had paid to the complainant alongwith agreed interest of @ 12% p.a.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove and also considering the grounds given in the application seeking condonation of delay in filing the appeal before the State Commission,  the delay in filing the appeal before the State Commission  is condoned and the order passed by the Fora below is modified to the extent that the respondent shall refund the entire principal amount received from the complainant to him within three months from today alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 12% p.a. w.e.f. six months from the date of realization of the first cheque on the amount of Rs.3 lakh and w.e.f. the date of realization of the second cheque on the balance amount of Rs.2,50,000/-.
","12.    The learned counsel for the respondent submits on instructions that the respondent is ready to give possession of a flat in this very project to the complainant with lump sum compensation of Rs.2 lakh or in the alternative to make refund in terms of the order passed by the Fora below. The parties are, therefore, given liberty to explore the possibility of the respondent delivering possession of a suitable flat to the complainant / petitioner on mutual acceptable terms. If such a settlement is reached, they shall comply with the said settlement instead of complying with this order. The revision petition stands disposed of.

","Heard.
2.     This appeal has been filed by Sahara Prime City Ltd., against the order dated 02.11.2017 passed by the Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Jaipur (‘the State Commission’) in CC no. 109 of 2016.
3.     Learned counsel for the appellant states that the principal amount has already been paid to the respondent/ complainant. However, now only the question of interest remains. The State Commission has awarded 15% per annum interest on the amount of refund from the respective dates of deposits. Learned counsel for the appellant states that in a recent judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd., vs Devasis Rudra – Civil Appeal no.3182 of 2019 – 2019 SCC online SC 438 decided on 25.03.2019, the apex court has awarded 9% per annum interest on the amount of refund.
4.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant states that there is an agreement between the parties wherein it is provided that the respondent will pay 15% per annum interest if the instalments are delayed. The learned counsel stated that the State Commission has ordered 15% per annum interest on the amount of refund on the basis of parity.
","5.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record. Firstly, there is no agreement between the parties that if the amount is to be refunded it will be refunded with 15% per annum interest. In fact there is no contract for paying any interest on the amount of refund. A builder utilises the amount given by the allottee in construction. We have seen the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd., vs Devasis Rudra (Supra) wherein the rate of interest on the amount of refund has been reduced from 12% per annum as awarded by this Commission to 9% per annum. The facts of the two cases are different. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we deem it appropriate to order interest @ 10% per annum instead of 15% per annum as awarded by the State Commission. Accordingly, the order of the State Commission dated 02.11.2017 stands modified by this order and the order be complied within a period of 45 days as both the parties are present. Appeal stands disposed off accordingly.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.        In FA No. 97 of 2013 husband of the complainant/appellant and in FA No. 237 and 238 of 2013 wife of complainants/appellants purchased Bharat Darshan package from respondent  No. 1 IRCTC by paying a sum of Rs. 6156/- to IRCTC for the said package. Under the package the appellants/complainants were to be taken on a tour namely Bharat Darshan. According to the complainants the package included journey by train, bus and streamers from New Delhi and back.
2.      On 15.09.2018 the above-referred persons boarded a boat/ steamer which was to take them from Lal Bazar to Gangasagar. According to the complainants that said steamer was provided/hired by IRCTC. The requisite safety measures such as divers and lifeguards on-board the steamer were not provided nor any medical facility was available on the steamer. When the steamer reached near Kakdwip in West Bengal it suddenly turned, turtle as a result of which nine passengers including the above-referred family members of the complainants died by sinking in the water. No compensation, however, was paid to the complainants. Alleging negligence, carelessness and defect in the service rendered to them by IRCTC the complainants approached concerned State Commission by way of three consumer complaints.
3.      The Complaints were resisted by the respondents.
4.      The State Commission having dismissed the consumer complaints the appellants/complainants are before this Commission.
5.      The question which arises for consideration in these appeals is as to whether the package which the deceased persons had taken from IRCTC included steamer ride or not. The learned counsel for the respondent  No. 1 has drawn my attention to note  forming part of the terms and conditions of Bharat Darshan train itinerary which the appellants themselves have filed and is available on page 42 of the paper book. The said note to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
“Only Rail and Road journeys are included in the itinerary, other journey such as by Boat/Ships/Ferry is not included in the itinerary, the passengers undertaking water journey will be solely on their own risk and expenses, IRCTC will not be responsible for any mishap during the water journey.”
It is thus evident that the package/itinerary sold to the deceased persons did not include journey by boat/ship/ferry. If the passengers wanted to undertake journey by boat/ship/ferry they had to make their own arrangement and had to perform the water journey at their own risk. It was also made clear to them that IRCTC will not be responsible for any mishap during the water journey.
6.      The learned counsel for the complainants has drawn my attention to the information provided by West Bengal police  on 22.11.2011 under Right to Information Act. The said information to the extent relied upon by the learned counsel for the complainants, reads under:-
“2. About 80 passengers were boarded in that trawler at the time of accident.
5. That trawler was got accident due to rough & negligence navigation and over-loading.
7.  Nothing were taken by IRCTC as safety/lifeguard for the passengers.
8. The case has been ended in charge sheet vide Kakdwip P.S.C.S. No. 396/10, Dkt. 25.12.2010 U/S, 280/282/304/120B IPC sent to the Court of Ld. ACJM, Kakdwip.  The case is now Subjudice.”
7.      The information extracted hereinabove does show that the  trawler/steamer met with an accident due to negligence on the part of its driver/captain who had not only overloaded the trawler/steamer but was also navigated it in a negligent manner. However since the trawler/streamer in which the passengers were travelling was not provided to them by IRCTC nor was it required to provide trawler/steamer to them, water journey being outside the purview of the package sold to them by IRCTC, the said company cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence committed by the driver/captain of the ship/trawler in which the passengers were travelling. Though it was stated in the information provided by West Bengal police that nothing was done by IRCTC to safeguard the life of the passengers no such obligation, in my opinion, was cast upon IRCTC, the company having not arranged the steamer/trawler in which the passengers were travelling nor it being liable to arrange a trawler/streamer for them.
8.      The learned counsel for the complainants/appellants has drawn my attention to a letter dated 19.10.2011 written by IRCTC to the complainants in which it is stated that the passengers were provided group insurance vide insurance policy issued by Oriental Insurance Company Limited and a sum of Rs.100000/- was payable in terms of the said policy to the legal heirs of each deceased. The said letter does not in any manner show or even indicate that that trawler/steamer in which the passengers travelled was arranged/hired by IRCTC.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, I have no hesitation in holding that no case of deficiency on the part of respondents in rendering services to the deceased passengers is made out. The order passed by the State Commission, therefore, does not call for any interference by this Commission  in exercise of it appellate jurisdiction. The appelas are, therefore, dismissed with no orders as to costs.
10.    It is, however, made clear that dismissal of the consumer complaints cannot come in the way of the complainants availing such remedy as may be open to them against the entities other than the IRCTC. They shall also be entitled to the amount, if any, payable to them under the group insurance policy issued by Oriental Insurance Company to IRCTC. However, IRCTC will not be under any obligation to pay that amount which the complainants will have to claim directly from the insurer.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Bharat J. Joshi,  Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :NEMO 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
No one is present for the respondents. I have therefore heard the learned Counsel for the appellants and have considered the record.
The complainants/appellants entered into agreements with the respondents wherein the respondents offered residential plots to the complainants and undertook to construct villas for the complainants on the said plots. The parties executed agreements incorporating their respective obligations in respect of the transactions. In FA No. 218 of 2019 and 219 of 2019 the construction of the Villa was to be completed within 18 months though a grace period of 6 months was also available to the respondents for the purpose. In FA No. 225 of 2019 the construction was to be completed within 24 months and the grace period of 6 months was available to the respondents. In the other appeals the construction was to be completed within 12 months and again a grace period of six months was available to the respondents for completing the construction. The construction of the villa having not been completed and the possession having not being offered to the complainants/appellants they approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the respondents who admitted the agreement with the complainants/appellants but claimed that the construction could not be completed in time on account of non-payment of dues by some other allottees of the project. The respondents also took a preliminary objection that the State Commission lacked jurisdiction to entertain the complaints and that even otherwise the complaints were barred by limitation.
3.      The State Commission vide impugned order dated 08.01.2019 directed the respondents to complete the remaining work and deliver possession to the complainants within one month. The respondents were also directed to pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation to the complainants along with cost of litigation quantified at Rs.10,000/- in each case. Being aggrieved  from the order of the State Commission as far as the quantum of compensation is concerned, the appellants are before this Commission.
4.      When these appeals came for hearing on 29.03.2019 the learned  Counsel for the appellants stated on instructions that he was pressing the appeals only against respondent 1 to 3 and was not pressing the same against respondents 4 and 5. Accordingly notice was issued only to respondents 1 to 3 and was accepted on their behalf on 29.03. 2019. 5.     A perusal of the impugned order would show that the state Commission held against the respondents on all the counts, clearly held that the defence taken by them to justify the delay in construction of the villa was only  a lame excuse and they were expected to take appropriate steps against the purchasers who were in default and complete the work of the villas sold to other purchasers. It was also noted by the state Commission that though the respondents had claimed that 95% of the construction had been completed, they had not produced any evidence to show their bonafides.
6.      Clause 5.8 of the agreement subject matter of FA No. 218 of  2019 reads as under:-
“The Builder shall be liable to pay to the purchaser at the rate of Rs. 2/- per square feet per month by way of liquidated damages, after expiry of the stipulated period mentioned in point No. 5.7 above, upto one year.  In case, if the Builder cannot complete the construction even after said extended period of one year then an amount of Rs. 10,000/- per month (as rental value) shall be paid to the Purchaser till the date of completion of construction.  However no amount by way of damages are otherwise shall be payable by the Vendor to the purchaser in case the construction is delayed for reasons beyond the control of the Vendor or if the purchaser has failed to pay agreed amounts on time or the purchaser failed to fulfill any other obligations.  The purchaser hereby undertakes to cooperate with the Vendor for due, proper expedient completion of all works.”
7.      Similar clause forms part of the agreement subject matter of FA No. 219 of 2019. However, the relevant clause in the agreement subject matter of the other appeals reads as under:-
“The Builder shall be liable to pay to the purchaser at the rate of Rs. 2/- per square feet per month by way of liquidated damages, after expiry of the stipulated period mentioned in point No. 5.7 above, upto the date of completion of construction. However, no amount by way of damages are otherwise shall be payable by the Vendor to the purchaser in case the construction is delayed for reasons beyond the control of the Vendor or if the purchaser has failed to pay agreed amounts on time or the purchaser failed to fulfill any other obligations.  The purchaser hereby undertakes to cooperate with the Vendor for due, proper expedient completion of all works.”
8.      It would thus be seen that in all the matters except FA No. 218/2019 and 219/2019 the agreement provided for payment of liquidated damages @ Rs.2/- per square feet per month, after the time period stipulated in clause 5.7 of the agreement for completion of the construction, whereas the agreements subject matter of FA No. 218/2019 and 219/2019 provided for payment of liquidated damages @ Rs.2/- per square feet per month for 1 year and thereafter liquidated damages were agreed to be paid @ Rs 10,000 per month that being the rental value of the villa.
9.      The learned counsel for the appellants/complainants states on instructions that in all the cases, the complainants are pressing for payment of the liquidated damages @ Rs 2/- per square feet per month for one year after the time period stipulated in clause 5.7 of the agreements and thereafter at the rate of Rs. 10,000/- per month.  In my opinion, considering all the facts and circumstances, including the failure of the respondents to justify the delay in completion of the construction, all the complainants should be awarded compensation as per clause 5.8 of the agreement subject matter of a No. 218 and 219 of  2019. In other words in all the matters the respondents should at least pay compensation @ Rs 2/- per square feet per month for 1 year and thereafter pay compensation at the rate of Rs. 10,000/-  per month till the possession in terms of the order of the State Commission is offered to the complainant after completing construction of the villas in all respects and obtaining the requisite occupancy certificate. Thus, the compensation shall be payable w.e.f. 18 months from the date of agreement in FA No. 510, 511, 512, 513, 514 & 845 of 2019, w.e.f. 24 months from the date of the agreement in FA No. 218 & 219 of 2019  and  w.e.f. 30 months from the date of the agreement in FA No. 225/2019.
10.    For the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned order is modified to the following extent:-
(a)     The respondents shall complete the construction of the villas, obtain the requisite occupancy certificate and then offer possession to the complainants in terms of the order of the State Commission within 3 months from today.
(b)     Respondents No. 1 to 3 shall pay compensation @ Rs. 2/- per square feet per month for 1 year and at the rate of Rs 10,000 per month after 1 year till the possession in terms of this order is offered to the complainants/appellants. The compensation shall be payable from the date computed in terms of clause 5.7 of the agreement after giving benefit of grace period of 6 months to the respondents.
(c)     The complainants/appellants shall also be entitled to cost of litigation awarded by the state Commission.
(d)     The compensation in terms of this order shall be paid while offering possession to the complainants/appellants within 3 months from today.
","(d)     The compensation in terms of this order shall be paid while offering possession to the complainants/appellants within 3 months from today.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
On 01.08.2003 an agreement was executed between Reddy Construction Company (hereinafter referred to  as “the builder”), appellant in FA No. 462 of 2012, and Prakash @ Deepak Dattaram @ Dattu Gaikwad  (hereinafter referred to as “the owner”),  appellant in FA No. 281 of 2012 whereunder a building was to be constructed by the builder on the land of the owner and total built-up area of 4245 sq. ft. exclusive of balcony and staircase area was to be provided by the builder to the owner.   Out of the said area 1595 sq. ft. of built-up area was to be constructed for commercial purpose on the ground floor of the proposed building whereas 2650 sq. ft. of the said area was to be constructed for residential purposes on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the proposed building.
2.      A tarpartite agreement was thereafter executed between the builder, owner and the complainant on 15.10.2003, whereunder the complainant, who was a tenant of the owner in the old structure which the builder was to demolish, was to be given 600 sq. ft. carpet area of the residential construction on the 6th floor of the proposed building and 70 sq. ft.  carpet area of the commercial construction on the ground floor, facing road.  The residential area was to be provided within 18 months whereas the commercial area was to be provided within six months.
3.      The case of the complainant is that the actual area of the residential flat provided to him was short by 77 sq. ft., his other grievance being that the commercial area in the form of a shop having carpet area of 70 sq. ft. on the ground floor of the building was not provided to him.  He, therefore, approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint.
The complaint was resisted by the builder as well as by the owner.  The builder alleged that the area of flat No. 602 which was in the use of the complainant was about 66/12 sq. ft. of carpet area.  As regards the commercial area it was claimed by that the complainant had given up her right to the said commercial area and had received cash compensation in lieu thereof.
The State Commission vide impugned order dated 04.04.2012 directed as under:-
“2. The opponents, jointly and severally do pay compensation of Rs. 10 Lakhs towards less area of the flat and Rs. 2 lakhs towards mental agony and sufferance of the complainant to the complainant.  This compensation be paid within period of 45 days from today and failing which it shall carry interest @ 18% p.a. till its realization.
3. The opponents, jointly and severally, do hand over possession of 70 sq. ft. commercial carpet area situated on ground floor, facing road as synonymous to description of shop No. 1 in the original plan to the complainant from the building known as “Reddy’s Shree Shivdatta” constructed on land bearing CTS No. 801/1 to 801/6, 746/3 and 746/4, Survey No. 104(pt) admeasuring about 423 st. mtrs. At Village Pahadi, Goregaon Taluka Borivali, Mumbai.
ALTERNATIVELY
The opponents, jointly and severally shall pay a compensation of Rs. 21 lakhs to the complainant along with interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of filing of this complaint i.e. 27.07.2010 till its realization.”
Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the complainant, the builder as well as the owner are before this Commission by way of these appeals.
4.      It would thus be seen from the agreement that the builder was to construct 1595 square feet of commercial area out of which 1078 square feet was to be constructed on the ground floor and provide the same to the owner who in turn, was to provide 70 square feet of commercial area on the ground floor to the complainant. Admittedly, no commercial area has been provided to the complainant though the residential flat has been provided to him. The case of the owner is that pursuant to an understanding between him and the complainant some compensation was paid to the complainant in lieu of the commercial space to be provided on the ground floor. However, there is no written agreement between the parties for giving compensation to the complainant in lieu of the commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet on the ground floor. Admittedly, no payment by way of cheque/demand draft etc. has been made by the owner to the complainant in lieu of the commercial area. I am unable to accept the oral agreement/understanding pleded by the owner in this regard. Considering that the parties and executed a detailed agreement incorporating their respective rights and obligations in respect of the bargain agreed between them it is difficult to accept that the owner had arrived at an oral understanding without reducing the alleged oral understanding into writing and thereafter made cash payment without making even a part of the alleged payment by way of a cheque/demand draft. Such a course of action was not likely in the ordinary course of human conduct considering that the agreement between the parties had been executed in writing and was a detailed agreement to which not only the owner and the complainant but the builder was also a party. Therefore, I have no hesitation in accepting the finding returned by the State Commission in this regard and confirming that a complainant is entitled to be suitable compensated either by providing a commercial space of equal size in a comparable building and locality or he is entitled to suitable monetary compensation in lieu of the said commercial area.
5.      The State Commission awarded an amount of Rs.21 lakhs to the complainant based upon the newspaper reports. The newspaper report do not constitute legal admissible evidence to prove the market value of a property. No sale deed was produced before the State Commission to prove the market value of the commercial area in the building constructed by the builder or in a similarly situated commercial property. Even the ready reckoner price prevailing on the date of complaint was not brought to the notice of the State Commission. The ready reckoner price reflects the minimum market price of the property in a particular area, be it a rehabilitation building or otherwise.  The prevailing market price is not likely to be less than the ready reckoner price, though it can be on the higher side.  Considering all the facts and circumstances including the failure of the parties to produce any evidence with respect to the market value of a comparable commercial premises, I am the considered  view that instead of paying Rs. 21 lacs along-with interest awarded by State Commission the owner as well as the builder should pay an amount equivalent  to the current ready reckoner price of a commercial space admeasuring 70 square feet in the locality in which this building has been constructed by the builder. The said amount shall be calculated and paid to the complainant within 6 weeks from today failing which  it will be  recoverable through the process of the State Commission.
6.      It is submitted by learned counsel for the owner that the builder should be responsible to compensate the complainant for the commercial space since commercial space admeasuring 1078 sq. ft.on the ground floor was not provided by the builder to the owner. The submission of the learned counsel for the developer on the other hand is that it is for the owner alone to compensate the complainant in this regard since commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet was to be provided to her by the owner out of the area to be given to him by the builder and the builder handed over the area as per the agreement between the parties to the owner. The learned counsel for the owner however maintains that commercial area admeasuring 1078 sq. ft on the ground floor was never provided to the owner by the builder. Be that as it may the builder as well as the owner both are jointly and severally liable to compensate the complainant in respect to the commercial area both of them being party to the agreement executed with the complainant in this regard on 15.10.2003. In fact had the builder not been a party to the said agreement the complement, in all likelihood, would not have even  entered into this transaction with the owner since he knew that it was the builder who would have to construct the building in which commercial space will have to be provided to him by the owner.
Moreover, there is no evidence of the owner having taken any action against the builder for not providing commercial area admeasuring 1078 sq. ft on the ground floor of the building to him. This indicates that the owner had foregone the commercial area to be provided to him under the agreement with the builder in terms of some understanding between him and the builder. If this is so, there is no reason why the owner should not compensate the complainant in lieu of commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet of on ground floor of the building. As far as the builder is concerned, he would be liable for two reasons, first reason being that he was also a party the commitment made to the complainant in this regard vide agreement dated 15.10.2003 and the second reason being that he has not constructed a shop of 70 sq. ft. on the ground floor despite knowing fully well that commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet has to be provided to the complainant under an agreement to which he was also a party.
At this stage the learned counsel for the builder submits that they had actually provided the commercial area as per the agreement dated 01.08.2003 to the owner. At this stage learned counsel for the owner submits though the builder had provided 1078 sq. ft of the commercial area on the ground floor to the owner, shop admeasuring  70 sq. ft.  for the complainant was neither got approved not constructed. In my opinion, since both the owner as well as a builder were party to the agreement dated 15.10.2003 the builder ought to have constructed a shop admeasuring 70 square feet on the ground  floor and provided the same to the owner, for making it available to the complainant. Therefore both the builder as well as the owner would be liable to compensate the complainant, the liability of the builder arising on account of his being a party to the tripartite agreement dated 15.01.2003 and his having not got approved and constructed a shop admeasuring 70 square feet.
7.      The State Commission has awarded compensation quantified at Rs. 2,00,000/- to the complainant for the mental agony and harassment undergoing by him. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case including the delay in delivery of possession of the residential flat the aforsaid compensation was fully justified and does not call for any interference by this commission in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. It will also pertinent to note that though there was delay in offering possession of residential flat which was to be made available within 18 months of the agreement no interest by way of compensation for the delay in possession of the flat was specifically claimed in the consumer complaint  and only a flat compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- for the mental agony and harassment was claimed.
8.      The next grievance of the complainant is with respect to the shortfall in the area of the flat which the owner has provided to him. As per the agreement executed between the parties on 15.10.2003 the complainant was entitled to a residential flat having carpet area of 600 square feet exclusive of the balcony area and staircase.
9.      This Commission appointed Mr. Hitendra K Mehta as the court commissioner to inspect the flat provided to the complainant and measure its area etc. The report of Mr. Mehta to the extent it is relevant in this regard reads as under:-
“MEASUREMENTS & ACTUAL INTERNAL/CARPET AREA OF THE FLAT:-
As per actual measures, the internal/carpet area of the flat under reference, is as given below:-
INTERNAL/CARPET AREA:
LIVING ROOM          : 10’-1”(E-W) X 19’-2 ½ (N-S)         = 193.64 SQ. FT.
KITCHEN                  : 10’-0”(E-W) X 7’-4”  (N-S)             = 73.30 SQ. FT.
KITCHEN ENTRANCE
OPENING                  : 2’-10”(E-W) X 0’-5” (N-S)              = 1.21 SQ. FT.
POOJA ROOM         : 6’-5”(E-W) X 4’-2” (N-S)                 = 26.77 SQ. FT.
INTERNAL PASSAGE
BETWEEEN ENT. OF
M. BED & BEDRM-II: 4’-4”(E-W) X 2’-11” (N-S)              = 12.64 SQ. FT.
MASTER BEDROOM AT
SOUTH WEST          : 12’-6”(E-W) X 10’-6” (N-S)            = 131.25 SQ. FT.
ATTACHED TOILET WITH
MASTER BEDROOM: 3’-11”(E-W) X 7’-0” (N-S)            = 27.44 SQ. FT.
BEDROOM-II
AT NORTH-WEST   : 13’-0”(E-W) X 9’-3” (N-S)              = 120.25 SQ. FT.
ATTACHED TOILET
WITH BEDROOM-II : 6’-7½ ”(E-W) X 3’-3” (N-S)            = 21.52 SQ. FT.
TOTAL                        =608.02 SQ. FT.
(56.51 SQ. MTS.)
THUS, THE ‘INTERNAL/CARPET AREA’ OF THE SAID FLAT, AS PER ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT, WORKS OUT TO 608.02 SQ. FT. (56.51 SQ. MTS.).”
It would thus be seen that as per the report of the court commissioner the area of the flat provided to the complainant is 608.02 square feet. He has separately measured living room, kitchen, pooja room etc. etc. it is evident that the area measured by him does not include either the balcony of the staircase.
10.    The learned counsel for the complainant, however, has drawn my attention to the following part the report of Mr. Mehta:-
“In the said approved plan, it is mentioned that the carpet area of the rooms, toilets and passages of the said flat is 48.60 Sq. Mtrs., which works out to 522.94 Sq. Ft. (which is excluding area of enclosed balconies (merged within rooms), admeanuring 58.12 sq Ft and also excluding  area of additional space of ‘POOJA ROOM', admeasuring 26.77 Sq. Ft.)
As the said area is excluding areas of enclosed balconies, (merged within rooms), the total actual internal/carpet area of the said flat, with reference to abovementioned approved plan works out as given below:-
INTERNAL/CARPET AREA:
AS PER APPROVED PLANS
CARPET AREA OF  ROOMS,
INTERNAL PASSAGE & TOILETS             =        522.94 SQ. FT. (48.60 SQ.
MTS.)
ADD:
CARPET AREA OF ENCLOSED
BALCONIES, MERGED WITH
THE ROOMS,
10’-0”(3.05 m) X 1’-6” (0.45M): 15.00 SQ. FT.
9’-2”(2.80 m) X 0’-11 ¾ ” (0.30): 8.99 SQ. FT.
10’-6”(3.20 m)) X 3’-3” (0.60M): 34.13 SQ. FT. =  58.12 SQ. FT. (5.40 SQ.
MTS.)
B) ADD: FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE
‘POOJA ROOM’
6-5”(1.96 m)) X 4’-2” (1.27M):                                 = 26.77 SQ. FT.(2.49 SQ.
MTS.)
TOTAL            = 607.83 SQ. FT. (56.49 SQ.
MTS.)
THUS, AS COMPARED WITH COPY OF APPROVED PLAN & BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ‘POOJA ROOM’ (BEING AN ADDITIONAL SPACE IN PORSESSION OF THE SAID OCCUPANT), THE INTERNAL/CARPET AREA' OF THE SAID FLAT, WORKS OUT TO 607.83 SQ. FT. (56.49 SQ. MTS).
THOUGH, IT 1S NOT WITHIN BCOPE OP MY ASSIGNMENT (AS PER THE ORDER OF HONBLE NATIONAL COMMISSION, DATED 03-05-2019), TO COMPARE THE CARPET AREA WITH REFERENCE TO APPROVED PLAN, IT IS MENTIONED ABOVE, AS ‘OTHER OBSERVATIONS’, ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT THE COPY OF APPROVED PLAN HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO ME, AT THE TIME OF MY SITE VISIT.
AS MENTIONED ADOVE, IN THE PRECEEDING CLAUSE, THE  ACTUAL INTERNAL/CARPET AREA OF PLAT NO. 602 UNDER REPERENCE, AS PER ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT BY ME IS 608.02 SQ.FT (56.51 SQ MTS.).
11.    The extract from thereport relied upon by the learned counsel of the complainant shows only this much that as per the approved plans the area of the flat exclusive of the carpet area of the balcony which has been merged with the rooms, was 522.94 square feet. It appears from a conjoint  reading of the report that though the carpet area of the flat as per the approved plan would be less than 600 square feet if the balcony area is to be excluded but the actual carpet area provided to the complainant was more than 600 square feet. This has happened on account of the balcony having been merged with the rooms. Therefore, interpreted in the terms of the agreement between the parties there is no shortfall in the carpet area made available to the complainant, the total carpet area available to her being 608.02 square feet. Though this has been done by merging the balcony area with the rooms, the said area has become part of the rooms, on account of the said merger.  After the merger with the room, the said area can.no more be said to be balcony.  Though the balcony area has either reduced or altogether disappeared on account of the said merger, this is not the case of the complainant that the owner and the builder were also required to provide balcony, in addition to the rooms etc.  Had the balcony been provided, the builder and the owner could not have included the area in the carpet area of the flat, but the balcony having not been provided and its area having been merged with the rooms, the complainant is using and enjoying the said area as rooms and not as the balconies.   Therefore, the complainant, in my opinion, is not entitled to any compensation on account of alleged shortfall in the area of the flat. I, therefore, need not examine the question as to whether the consumer complaint, having been filed more than 2 years after taking possession was time barred or not, as far as the grievance with respect to shortfall in the carpet area of the flat is concerned.
12.    It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the complainant that  out of the amenities promised in the agreement, some amenities were not provided, the said amenities, according to him, being  (1) marble slab in the kitchen was not provided (2) the tiles in the kitchen were not provided upto the roof level and (3) capacity of the storage tank was less than what had been added. Admittedly, the possession of the flat was taken by the complainant on 01.07.2007. The cause of action to claim compensation for not providing those amenities or for a direction to provide those amenities arose to the complainant on that date. The consumer complaint, therefore,  ought to have been instituted within 2 years thereof of, the prescribed period of limitation in terms of section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act being 2 years from the date of accrual of the cause of action. The consumer complaint having been instituted in July 2010 was clearly barred by limitation as for as the deficiencies in the said amenities are concerned.
","13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of with the following directions:-
(a)     The builder M/s Reddy Constructions and the owner Prakash @ Deepak Dattaram @ Dattu Gaikwad shall execute agreement in terms of Section 4 of MOFA in favour of the complainant in respect of the residential flat in question within 6 weeks from today. The requisite stamp duty and registration charges for the said agreement will be paid by them as per the agreement dated 15.10.2003.
(b)     The complainant shall be enrolled as a member of the Cooperative Housing Society consisting of the apartment owners in the aforesaid building within 6 weeks from today.
(c)     The builder and owner shall pay the current ready reckoner price in respect of the commercial shop on the ground floor of the building in question to the complainant within 6 weeks from today.
(d)     The owner and the builder shall also pay a sum of Rs 2 lacs as compensation to the complaint for the mental agony and harassment underground by her.
(e)     The builder and the owner shall pay  cost of litigation quantified at Rs. 50,000/- to the complainant within 6 weeks from today.
14.    Since a sum of Rs.12 lacs has already been paid to the complainant the compensation amount of Rs. 2 lakhs payable to her shall be adjusted out of the said amount. The balance amount shall be adjusted out of the compensation payable to her in respect of the commercial shop which was to be provided to her on the ground floor of the building.
The learned Counsel for the owner is permitted to file his vakalatnama  during the course of the day.

2.      Clause 3, 4, 6 and 9 of the MoU read as under:-
“3) That the FIRST PARTY till date has already executed Agreement to Sell & Purchase for Residential unit(s)/plot(s)  in the said PROJECT with its customers, hereinafter referred to as Intending Allottee(s), and has received payments from those customers/intending Allottee(s) as detailed in  “Annexure-C” of this MoU.
4)         That the SECOND PARTY will adjust these Intending Allottee(s), as mentioned in the “Annexure-C” of this MoU, in case any of these intending Allottee(s) wish to retain/buy plot(s)/unit(s) in the said PROJECT, subject to the condition that their prevailing plot/unit rate(s),  Basic Sale Price (BSP), in the Agreement to Sell with the FIRST PARTY should not be less than Rs. 12,000/- psy (Rupees Twelve Thousand only per sq. yard) and also subject to the availability of plot(s)/unit(s) in the said PROJECT.
6)         That the SECOND PARTY will have the rights to execute a fresh Agreement to Sell & Purchase with these Intending allottee(s) who wish to retain their Unit(s)/Plot(s).  And will receive the balance payment from them, as and when demanded as per their new payment terms and conditions in the Agreement to Sell & Purchase executed with the SECOND PARTY.
9)         That the sale amount received by the FIRST PARTY from those Intending Allottee(s) as mentioned in “Annexure-C” of this MoU, who do not wish to retain their Plots/Units in the said PROJECT, then it will the Sole responsibility of the FIRST PARTY to either refund them or adjust that amount in any of their (FIRST PARTY) other Projects.  Under no circumstances the SECOND PARTY will be responsible for the amount received from those intending Allottee(s), as mentioned in Annexure-C’ of this MoU, who do not wish to retain their Plots/Units in the said PROJECT.”
3.      No fresh agreements were executed by the Complainants with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and no payment was made by them to the afore-said firm.  Since the plots allotted to them by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. were not developed, the Complainants approached the concerned District Forum/State Commission by way of separate complaints.  In two cases the complaints were instituted before the District Forum whereas in one case the complaint was instituted before the State Commission.  The complainants sought refund of the amount which they had paid for the plots along with interest, compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted both by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  and Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  As noted by the State Commission it was stated in the written version filed by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. that no assured allotment had been made by them and the Complainant was only an investor.  The said written version, it is informed, was filed only in Consumer Complaint subject matter of FA No. 760/2016. The complaint was resisted by the petitioner/appellant Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company primarily on the ground that there was no privity of contract between them and the complainants and in terms of the MoU, it was for UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. to refund the amount received from such allottees who did not switch over to them and did not execute agreements with them.
","5.      The consumer complaints having been allowed by the District Forum in Revision Petition No. 495 and 496 of 2017, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The said appeals having been dismissed the aforesaid petitioner is before this Commission by way of Revision Petitions No. 495 and 496 of 2017. The consumer complaint subject matter of FA No. 760 of 2016 having been allowed by the State Commission against the appellant herein namely Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company as well as UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the afore-said firm is before this Commission by way of FA No. 760 of 2016.
6.      It is an admitted position that no payment whatsoever was made by any of these complainants to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  It is also an undisputed position that none of them executed any agreement with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of clause 6 of the MoU.  It is evident from a bare perusal of  clause 4 of the MoU that the Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company was required to adjust the persons to whom allotment was made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. in case any of them wished to retain the plots subject to the condition that the price in that case was not to be less than ₹12,000/- per sq. yd. and such adjustment was to be subject to the availability of the plots/units in the afore-said project.  The total number of the allottees who were to be adjusted by  Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company was not to exceed 75 and for every allottee retaining their plot/unit with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company a sum of  ₹50,000/- was to be paid to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  It is also evident from clause 9 of the MoU that if an allottee did not wish to retain plot/unit in the project with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company, the refund to such allottee was to be made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. and not by Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  It was expressly made clear in clause 9 of the MoU that under no circumstance Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company will be responsible for the amount received from such allottees who did not wish to retain their plots/units in the project.
7.      Even as per annexure B to the MoU, if any allottee to whom allotment was made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. wanted to retain his plot/unit, the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. received from such an allottee was to be adjusted in the payment which Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company had to make to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. by 15.084.2017 and in that case, the amount paid by the allottee retaining the plot/unit in the project was to be taken as the payment made by Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.
8.      Since the allottees did not write to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company seeking to retain their allotment on the terms and conditions mentioned in the MoU, it is only UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. which remained liable to make refund of the amount which it had received from them along-with appropriate interest/compensation and no such liability can be imposed upon Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company particularly in view of clause 9 of the MoU executed on 13.01.2015.
9.      The learned Counsel for the Complainant has drawn my attention to clause 15 of the MoU which reads as under:-
“That complete sale process, w.e.f. date of Signing of this MoU by both the Parties, for the Plot(s)/Unit(s) in the said PROJECT including Agreement/Sale documents and payments collection will be executed sole by the SECOND PARTY.  Under no circumstances, the FIRST PARTY will be able to sell and/or execute any documents pertaining to the Sale of the Plot(s)/Unit(s) in the said PROJECT directly to any third party, without the written consent from the SECOND PARTY.”
The aforesaid clause, in my opinion, is wholly irrelevant for the purpose of deciding these matters since the said Clause deals with the completion of the project but obviously would apply only in respect of those allottees who switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of clause 14(I4) of the MoU and not to the allottees  who did not switched over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and the entire payment by whom was made only to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  In fact, even UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. did not claim in its written version filed before the State Commission that it was the obligation of Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company to refund the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. had received from the Complainants.  In fact, in an affidavit dated 17.084.2015 Mr. Udai Raj Singh Brar, Director of UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. has clearly stated that any amount received by the Company UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. jfrom any party/individual against the booking/sale etc. of any part/unit/plot in the project Capital Greens will be the responsibility of UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. including refund etc., and under no circumstance Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company or its assignees or employees will have any responsibility for the refund of the said amount.
10.    It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the complainants that after executing MoU with UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company did not write any letters to the complainants informing them of the execution of the MoU and giving them an option to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of the MoU executed between the parties.  However, no such obligation on Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company is found in the MoU.  Primarily, it was for UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the said company having collected money from the complainants to inform the allottees of the said MoU and given them an opportunity to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of the MoU executed between Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  No doubt UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. could not have compelled the allottees to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company on the terms and conditions agreed between Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., but then if such terms and conditions were not acceptable to the allotees, the appropriate course of action for them was to take recourse to legal proceedings against UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the said company having taken money and having made allotment to them.
11.    For the reasons stated, hereinabove, the impugned orders to the extent Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company has also been directed to refund the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  received from the Complainants cannot be sustained and to this extent the impugned order is set aside.  However, the impugned orders to the extent they are directed against UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. and its Directors remained unaltered.  The appeal and the revision petitions stand disposed of accordingly.

2.      The possession of the allotted flats having not been delivered to them by the date stipulated in the agreements in this regard, the complainants/appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking possession of the allotted flats with compensation.
3.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent primarily on the following grounds:
(i) The State Commission did not have the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the Consumer Complaint.
(ii) The bed rocks were encountered while carrying out excavation though it had not shown up during initial soil testing, which necessitated blasting of the rocks and license for carrying out the blasting work had to be obtained, which resulted in delay.
(iii) There was delay in obtaining the Commencement Certificate from BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike).
(iv) There was short supply of construction material.
(v) There was strike by construction material suppliers.
(vi) There was shortage of labour.
4.      It was also stated in the written version that the respondent was ready and willing to deliver possession of the allotted flats to the complainants.
5.      The possession of the allotted flats was delivered to the complainants/appellants during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints before the State Commission and the sale deeds in their favour were also executed. The State Commission was of the opinion that considering the ground given by the respondent for the delay in completion of the construction, it was entitled to an extension of six months.  For the subsequent delay, the State Commission awarded compensation @ Rs.10,000/- per month, in each complaint.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission on the quantum of compensation, the appellants/complainants are before this Commission.
6.      It is also submitted on behalf of the respondent that they have provided free modular kitchen to the complainants in order to compensate them for the delay in completion of the construction.  The offer to provide free modular kitchen was made to the complainants during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints and was accepted by the complainants/appellants.
7.      Thus, the only question involved in these appeals is as to whether the complainants/appellants have been adequately compensated for the delay in delivery of possession of the allotted flats to them or not.
8.      The learned counsel for the parties have drawn my attention to clause 8.1 and 8.2 of the agreements which read as under:
8.1    The First Party, based on its present plans and estimates and subject to all just exceptions, contemplates to complete the construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment and agrees to complete construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment on or before 30th November, 2011 with a grace time of an additional 3 (three) months in case of delay without having to pay to the Second Party and interest or damages.  The First Party shall handover possession of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment to the Second Party only after the same is ready of occupation and subject to payment of all the amounts due under this Agreement.  In the event of delay in handover beyond the time period as above the First Party shall pay to the Second Party interest at the rate of 10% (ten percent) per annum, pro-rated for further periods of such delays.  The interest shall be calculated on all amounts received by the First Party from the Second Party, excluding the taxes and deposits.  Such penalty shall be applicable only if the Second Party has made all payments to First Party as per the payment schedule agreed to at the time of booking and as attached hereto.
8.2    Though every effort will be made to obtain electrical, water and sanitary connections within the stipulated time, no responsibility will be accepted by the Second Party for delays in obtaining such connections, clearances, certificates from the statutory authorities and the Second Party shall not be entitled to claim any damage/losses against the First Party on the ground of such delay.  The First Party shall not be liable if they are unable to complete the construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment and deliver possession by the aforesaid date by reason of non-availability of cement, steel and other construction materials, civil commotion or by any act of God or if the delay is caused as a result of any Rule, Notification of the Government, Municipal Authority, any Court and/or any other public or competent Authority prohibiting construction activities or for reason beyond the control of the First Party and in any of the aforesaid events, the First Party shall be entitled to reasonable extension of time for delivery and possession of the completed premises and the monies till then paid by the Second Party under this agreement shall not be refunded.
9.      It would thus be seen that the possession of the apartments was to be delivered on or before the date stipulated in clause 8.1 of agreements that a grace period of three months was also available to the respondent.  In the event of delay, the respondent was required to pay interest @ 10% per annum for the period of delay.
10.    Clause 8.2 of the agreements gives benefit to the respondent in respect of the delay in obtaining the electrical, water and sanitary connections, clearances and certificates from the statutory authorities.  The use of the expression ‘delays’ in clause 8.2 of the agreements would mean that in order to claim benefit of the said clause, the respondent was required to prove that the grant of the requisite sanctions, clearance etc. had taken more than the time usually taken for such clearances and certificates and the said delay occurred without there being any fault on the part of the respondent.  Since no one can be allowed to take advantage of his own lapse, respondent would not be entitled to any benefit of clause 8.2 of the agreement if the delay in grant of the requisite clearances and certificates, is attributable to it.
The respondent did not specify, in the written version filed by it as to when it had applied for obtaining the electrical, water and sanitary connections, how much time was taken by the concerned authorities in granting such connections and how much was the time usually taken by the concerned authorities in grant of such connections.  The correspondence exchanged between the respondent and the concerned authorities in this regard was not placed before the State Commission.  Therefore, it can hardly be disputed that the respondent had failed to establish, before the State Commission that there was delay in grant of electrical, water and sanitary connections and the said delay had occurred without there being any lapse/defect or shortcoming on the part of the respondent in seeking such connections.
11.    Under clause 8.2 of the agreement, the respondent was not to be liable in case of delay in completion of construction due to non-availability of cement, steel and other construction material.  However, no evidence was led before the State Commission to prove that cement, steel or any other construction material was not actually available in the market during the relevant period, despite efforts made by the respondent to procure such construction material.  No evidence of any civil commotion or any act of God having actually delayed the construction was produced by the respondent.  There is no evidence of any rule, notification etc. of an authority having prohibited construction activity.  Therefore, the benefit of clause 8.2 of the agreement, in my opinion, was not available to respondent.
12.    As regards the bed rock alleged to have been encountered by the respondent at foundation level, neither the initial soil testing report was filed before the State Commission to prove that the bed rocks had not shown up in the initial soil testing report nor did the respondent place any document on record to prove the time actually taken in obtaining the license required for carrying out the blasting work.  Therefore, it would be difficult to justify the delay on account of the bed rocks alleged to have been encountered during the course of excavation.  In any case, the agreement does give an extension of three months to the respondent for delay on account of any unforeseen circumstsances.
13.    Though it is alleged that there was delay on the part of the BBMP in granting the commencement certificate, no evidence has been led to prove the said delay.  No documents were filed before the State Commission to prove the date on which the commencement certificate was sought and the date on which the said commencement certificate was actually issued.  No evidence was led to prove how much time is usually taken by BBMP in grant of such commencement certificate.  The correspondence exchanged between the respondent and BBMP in this regard has not been placed on the record of the State Commission to substantiate the alleged delay in grant of the commencement certificate.  Therefore, the aforesaid ground, in my opinion, did not stand established before the State Commission.
14.    There is no evidence of strike by construction material suppliers.  It is otherwise difficult to accept that the supply of the construction material in the area remained wholly suspended on account of the alleged strike of the construction material suppliers.  Moreover, the dates of the alleged strike by the construction material suppliers were not given in the written version filed before the State Commission.
15.    Though the respondent alleged shortage of labour, no evidence was led to prove that the labour was not actually available in the market despite the efforts made by the respondent or the contractors engaged by it for carrying out the construction work.
16.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I have no hesitation in holding that the respondent failed to justify the delay in delivery of possession to the complainants/appellants.   Therefore, they are entitled to the agreed compensation after getting benefit of the grace period of three months envisaged in clause 8.1 of the agreement to the respondent.
17.    As per clause 8.1 of the agreement, the respondent was required to pay interest @ 10% per annum to the complainants for the period the construction was delayed.  There is no reason why the complainants should be denied even the compensation which the developer had agreed to pay to them at the time the agreements were executed with them.  This is more so when clause 4.1 of the agreements required payment of interest @ 18% per annum in the event of delay on the part of the complainants in making payment to the respondent.
18.    Admittedly, modular kitchen was provided by the respondent to the complainant during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints in order to compensate them for the delay in completion of the construction.  There is no evidence of the modular kitchen being a part of the agreement executed between the parties.  Therefore, the difference between the cost of modular kitchen and a regular kitchen, as per the agreement executed between the parties, has to be adjusted out of the compensation to which the complainants/appellants are entitled in terms of their agreements with the respondent.
","19.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the Appeals and the Consumer Complaints are disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      The respondent shall convey to the complainants/appellants, within four weeks from today, the difference between the cost of the modular kitchen as provided by it to the complainants/appellants and the cost of the regular kitchen which the respondent had to provide to the complainants/appellants as per the agreements executed with them.    The communication which the respondent will send to the complainants/appellants in this regard, will be accompanied by reports of an Architect and a Chartered Accountant of the respondents, both of whom will also certify the difference in the cost of the modular kitchen and the regular kitchen, to be calculated in terms of this order.  The relevant date for the purpose of calculating the difference in the cost would be the date on which the possession of the apartment was offered to the complainants/appellants.  The adjustment between the cost of the modular kitchen and normal kitchen, calculated in terms of this order, would be applicable only in case of those complainants/appellants who have been provided with the facility of a modular kitchen in their apartments.
(ii)      The respondent shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% per annum w.e.f. three months from the last date stipulated in the agreement for delivery of possession in clause 8.1 of the agreements till the date on which the possession was offered to the complainants.  The difference between the cost of the modular kitchen and the regular kitchen, as calculated in terms of this order, shall be adjusted while computing the compensation in the form of simple interest payable to the complainants/appellants in terms of this order.
(iii)     If any payment has been made to the complainants towards compensation, that shall also be adjusted from the interest payable to them in terms of this order.
(iv)    The compensation by way of interest shall be payable on the entire amount which the complainants/appellants had paid to the respondent on or before the last date stipulated in clause 8.1 of the agreement for delivery of possession.
(v)     The complainants/appellants shall also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- as the cost of litigation in each complaint.
(vi)    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today.

6.     The Appeals, F.A. No.  1136 of 2018, F.A. No. 1250 of 2018 and F.A. No. 1858 of 2019, have been filed on 20.06.2018, 12.07.2018 and 11.09.2019, respectively, against the said Order dated 09.12.2014 of the State Commission.
7.     The Award made by the State Commission vide its Order of 09.12.2014 is as below:
11.     In view of aforesaid observations, we hold that complaint is based on substantive merit.  Therefore, complainant must succeed against opponents.  We hold accordingly and pass the following order:-
-: ORDER :-
1.       Complaint is allowed.
2.       Opponents are directed to execute registered agreement to sale in favour of complainant in respect of flat No.603 on 6th floor in the building known as “Urmi Chhaya” at Asalpha, Ghatkopar (West), Mumbai-400086 as per allotment letter dated 16/08/2010 within a period of sixty days from the date of this order with advance written intimation to the complainant by registered post acknowledgement due.
3.       Complainant is directed to pay balance consideration of Rs.10 Lakhs to opponent Nos.1 & 2 and obtain a valid receipt against payment within a period of thirty days from the date of this order. In case, opponent No.2 failed or resisted to accept the amount of Rs.10 Lakhs, complainant is directed to deposit said amount in the office of this State Commission at Mumbai and obtain receipt within a period of fifteen days from the date of refusal of opponent No.2, if any.
4.       On receipt of entire consideration, opponents are directed to hand over vacant possession of flat No.603 on 6th floor in the building known as “Urmi Chhaya” at Asalpha, Ghatkopar (West), Mumbai-400086 as per allotment letter dated 16/08/2010 to the complainant.
5.       Opponents are further directed to pay amount of Rs.2 Lakhs as compensation to the complainant towards physical and mental hardship suffered by her.
6.       Opponents are also directed to bear their own costs and pay Rs.50,000/- as costs of this litigation to the complainant.
7.       Non-compliance of the order within stipulated period; opponents shall have to pay Rs.1,000/- per day to the complainant till full compliance of this order.
8.       Copies of the order be furnished to the parties.
8.     In reference to sub-para 3 of the Award, learned Counsel for the Respondent No. 1 / Complainant submits that the Complainant made immediate and continuous attempts to deposit the balance consideration amount of Rs. 10 lakh with the Opposite Parties No. 1 and No. 2. On the Opposite Party No. 2 not accepting and issuing receipt for the said amount of Rs. 10 lakh, despite immediate and continuous attempts, the Complainant deposited the same with the State Commission on 04.04.2015 vide a Pay Order dated 31.03.2015. The Complainant was dutiful and diligent in complying with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award i.e. to pay / deposit the balance consideration of Rs. 10 lakh. The said deposit was made before the State Commission after some natural time was first taken in the continuous endeavours of the Complainant to pay the said amount and obtain receipt therefor from Opposite Party No. 2. The delay, if at all any, was unintentional, and, in all contingencies, reasonable, and, as such, acceptable.
9.     It is noted that, on the Opposite Parties not complying with sub-para 2 and sub-paras 4 to 7 of the directions contained in the Award, the Complainant filed E.A. No. 08 of 2018 in C.C. No. 304 of 2011 before the State Commission on 09.01.2018.
10.   It is further noted that:
[a] the Complainant was dutiful and diligent in complying with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award made by the State Commission, the short delay of 71 days beyond the specific period stipulated by the State Commission is understandable, per se reasonable, does not materially or significantly affect the compliance; and
[b] no Appeal had been filed before this Commission by any of the Opposite Parties till the relevant date i.e. 09.01.2018 when the Complainant filed her E.A. No. 08 of 2018 before the State Commission (which was 1011 days after she had made the compliance of the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award).
11.   The Order dated 09.12.2014 of the State Commission had attained finality within the meaning of Section 24 of the Act 1986 when the said Order was put to execution on 09.01.2018.
12.   The execution proceedings, of trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986, had been initiated before the instant three F.A.s, No. 1136 of 2018, No. 1250 of 2018 and No. 1858 of 2019, were filed before this Commission on 20.06.2018, 12.07.2018 and 11.09.2019, respectively.
13.   Without entering into its merits, a perusal of the State Commission’s Order of 09.12.2014 shows that the Appellant in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018, who was the Opposite Party No. 2 before the State Commission, the Appellant in F.A. No. 1250 of 2018, who was the Opposite Party No. 3 before the State Commission, and the Appellant in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019, who was the Opposite Party No. 4 before the State Commission, had been duly served and were aware of the C.C. No. 304 of 2011.
14.   The stated reasons for delay, as contained in the respective applications for condonation of delay, are reproduced below for ready appreciation:
Application for condonation of delay in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018
I say that I have filed the present Condonation of delay Application against the Respondents as the Order passed by The Hon’ble State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra, Mumbai in Case No. CC/11/304 on 09.12.2014 was hand delivered to me on 03rd May 2018.

Application for condonation of delay in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019
2.       That the humble applicant was working partners in respondent firm and therefore, he was retired from the firm said firm by executing the deeds which is annexed in the Appeal Memo.  Thereafter by executing the Indemnity Bond the then existing partner of the firm has taken all the liability of the subject transition in appeal memo particularly of Smt. Kamal Dattatray Kale the Respondent No. 1 herein and has assured and undertaken to keep me indemnified from all claims and losses.  The applicant had brought the said documents on record before the Trial Court and after receiving the indemnity bond and assurances from respondent No. 2 to 5 has stop attending the aforesaid matter.
3.       That applicant was assured by the Respondent No. 2 to 5 and they had taken all liability vide Indemnity Bond dated 5th July 2012 they had requested me that they and firm will take care of the Respondent No. 1 and its claim as such applicant had stopped attending the matter before the Trial Court. The applicant has learned that the Respondent No. 2 to 5 have invited the said impugned order by not attending the subject case before the Trial Court and when in execution proceedings he was taken in to custody by the police authority on he came to know about the said impugned order in the year 2018 only. That applicant is a senior Citizen and has taken all due care and diligence till he was assured by the Respondent No. 2 to 5.
4.       It is respectfully submitted that applicant was served with the appeal memo of the appeal preferred by the Respondent No. 2 to 4.  Thereafter applicant had filed my written statement/reply to the said case and had brought the said true and correct facts before this Hon’ble Court and has supported the prayer of quashing or set aside the impugned order/judgment. The applicant has even filed application before the Trial Court and attending the day to day hearing in execution proceedings and when applicant meets his new advocate in the month of August he has advised him to file proper appeal before this Hon’ble Tribunal to seek justice. The applicant was not aware that despite filling reply and protesting the impugned order under the law and he needs to file Appeal Memo to challenge the same.
5.       It is respectfully submitted that delay in filing the instant appeal was not deliberate or intentional but has occurred due to the reasons mentioned above. It is further submitted that the applicant has been in continues in touch with the Respondents who were fully aware of the said facts despite they have not pointed out to the court true and correct facts and have invited the impugned order against the Appellant despite facts that they had taken over all liability of the appellant and has specifically agreed to settle the issue/liability in relation with the Respondent No. 1.
6.       That the applicant has received a letter impugned order dated 12.12.2014 on 1st week of July, 2018 the time to file appeal was till 1st August, 2018. I am filling the Appeal on ______ and such there is delay of ______ days.
7.       That delay as caused in the filing complaint not is bona fide or deliberate rather delay is caused due to false assurance given by the Respondent. That there is sufficient grounds to condone the delay and admit the First Appeal. The applicant was prevented by sufficient reasons by which he was prevented from filing of Complaint. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, it is just and proper that the Honourable Court be pleased to condone the delay of _____ days in filing the present appeal.
8.       That no prejudice of whatsoever nature will be caused to the Respondent if the delay in filing the complaint is condone. The Applicant states that on the contrary if delay is not condoned serious hardship will be caused to the Applicant and his statutory right to file the complaint will become infructuous. I say that even two appeals being No. 1136 of 2018 and 1250 of 2018 against the subject impugned order filed by Respondent No. 3 and 4 herein is pending before this Hon’ble Court and this Hon’ble Court shall be hearing the same as such no prejudice will be caused anyone if my appeal is also heard alongwith the said appeal. The appellant herein has already filed detail reply in said appeals and has brought the said facts before this Hon’ble Court as such if present application is allowed parties shall not be taken by surprised or new facts.
15.   It is seen that in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018 and in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019 the number(s) of days of delay in the applications for condonation of delay have been left blank.
In F.A. No. 1250 of 2018 the self-admitted self-computed delay is written to be 1282 days.
16.   A mere perusal of the three applications for condonation of delay shows that the stated reasons therein have a ring of untruth, and, in the totality of the facts, it would not be wrong to say that the edifice on which the stated reasons is built has its foundation on blatant untruth professed brazenly.
It is evident that,
after the Complainant had dutifully complied with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award made by the State Commission (on 04.04.2015),
after the Complainant had moved execution (on 09.01.2018),
after the Opposite Parties renegaded on the directions contained in sub-para 2 and sub-paras 4 to 7 of the Award for about 2 years 9 months and 5 days i.e. 1011 days (from 04.04.2015 to 09.01.2018),
after the prescribed period of limitation of 30 days had long elapsed (in early 2015),
after the Order of the State Commission had attained finality and had been put to execution,
after the State Commission had taken cognizance and was conducting trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986,
the instant three F.A.s were filed before this Commission by the Appellants, the Opposite Parties No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 before the State Commission, judgment debtors / accused before the State Commission.
This is nothing but bald-faced disregard to the law of limitation, and an anyhow attempt to thwart the trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986.
17.   Sufficient cause to condone the delay is not visible.
18.   There is no mitigating factor forthcoming to condone the delay. On the contrary, it would be unjust, albeit a travesty of justice, if, in such facts and situation, as succinctly summed-up above, the Complainant is put to prejudice by condoning the delay in these three heavily time-barred Appeals.
","19.   The applications for condonation of delay, being patently ill-conceived and totally bereft of merit, are dismissed.
20.   Resultantly, the three Appeals stand dismissed on limitation.
B.     A.E. No. 94 of 2018, A.E. No. 107 of 2018 and A.E. No. 109 of 2018
21.   The said three Appeals (Execution) have been filed under Section 27A of the Act 1986, challenging the Order dated 08.03.2018 passed by the State Commission in E.A. No. 08 of 2018 in C.C. No. 304 of 2011.
22.   The Appellant in A.E. No. 94 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 3 before the State Commission, the Appellant in A.E. No. 107 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 2 before the State Commission and the Appellant in A.E. No. 109 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 5 before the State Commission.
All three Appellants are judgment debtors / accused before the State Commission in execution proceedings.
23.   A perusal of the State Commission’s impugned Order of 08.03.2018 shows that it has been passed in trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986. The trial is still being conducted by the State Commission, it has as yet not concluded the trial.
24.   Learned Counsel for the Appellants argued that the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. is not being followed by the State Commission.
However, the complete relevant material, including the chronological proceedings before the State Commission and the Statements recorded by the State Commission, have not been filed by any of the Appellants in any of the Appeals (Execution). The onus of filing the complete relevant material, including the proceedings and Statements, etc., was on the Appellants, which onus they have failed to discharge. In the absence of the complete relevant material, it is difficult to examine whether or not the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. is being followed.
25.   This Commission would not want to unnecessarily impede or interfere in the trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986, unless a palpable, crucial error is forthcoming, which, as already said, is difficult to discern in the absence of the complete relevant material having been placed on record.
26.   In such facts and situation, the ends of justice would be met by the following directions:
[a] The Appellants shall present themselves in person before the State Commission on 30.03.2020, the next date fixed by the State Commission.
[b] The Appellants shall be free to be accompanied by their respective advocates.
[c] The Appellants shall be free to raise all their issues and contentions and to make all their submissions before the State Commission.
[d] The State Commission shall adjudicate as per the law, the trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986 shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions for Trial Of Summons-Cases By Magistrates as contained in Chapter XX of the Cr.P.C.
[e] The Appellants shall have liberty to file Appeal(s) under Section 27A if they are aggrieved by any order of the State Commission, including, specifically,
(i) in case of any significant material infringement of the applicable provisions of the Cr.P.C., or
(ii) against any sentence of imprisonment or fine or both.
Needless to say, such Appeal(s), if and when filed, shall be considered on merit as per the law.
27.   The three Appeals (Execution) are so disposed.
‘Dasti’, in addition, to all parties.

RAJINDER KUMARS/O SHRI RANJEET SINGH, PROPRIETOR, OF M/S SHRI BALAJI ENTERPRISES, FATEHBADDISTRICT-FATEHABADHARYANA...........Respondent(s)
 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :MS. NANITA SHARMA 
  For the Respondent      :MR. JAGMOHAN DHARIWAL 
","1.      The present revision petition has been filed against the order dated 19.01.2016 of the State Commission whereby the appeal of the petitioner against the order dated 4.7.2014 of the District Forum in complaint No.146 of 2013, was dismissed.
2.      The brief facts of the case are that the respondent, a proprietor of the gas agency named as Sh. Balaji Enterprises, Fatehabad, insured his agency with the petitioner vide policy no.  111903/46/11/22/00000009  for the period from 21.05.2011 to 20.05.2012.  Admittedly, the fire had broken
-2-
out on the night of 17.03.2012 which caused damage to the stock and to other items lying in the insured’s property.  Information was given to the petitioner and petitioner appointed a surveyor Mr. Naresh Kumar Bansal who visited the agency and verified the loss and calculated the loss of Rs.1,58,471/- and also held that the complainant had spent Rs.10,000/- on painting and glasses etc. of the agency.  Despite the report of the surveyor, the petitioner did not settle the claim.  The respondent sought information under the RTI Act.  Thereafter, the respondent received a letter dated 24.05.2013 from the petitioner, settling his claim for a sum of Rs.2,762/- on the basis of losses assessed by the surveyor.  Aggrieved by the said act of the petitioner, the complaint was filed by the complainant/Respondent.
3.      The petitioner had taken the plea that the surveyor had visited the spot on 26.06.2012 and assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.2,762/- and that they had sent a letter dated 16.08.2012 to the complainant with settlement/intimation voucher but it was the complainant who did not take any step.  It was alleged by the petitioner that there was no deficiency on the part of the insurance company as the surveyor was an independent Government approved surveyor who had prepared his report after visiting the site in question.  Parties led their evidences.  After hearing the
-3-
arguments of the learned counsels and placing the relevant record, the District Forum has held as under :
PARA 4 ...    “The OP has failed to explain on the case file that as per stock register how much stock was lying in the office and how much stock was lying in the go down.  Though the OP has placed on file copy of claim Form Ex.R5 in which Trading & Profit & loss Form is attached but the said Trading & Profit & loss Form is no helpful to the OP because it has no where mentioned that the stock mentioned in both i.e. office and go down have been verified from any stock record/register.  Perusal of document Ex.C8 i.e. LPG Dealers Package Policy reveals that the office stock was insured for Rs.2,00,000/-.  In the present complaint the complainant has claimed compensation for the loss caused to him due to the fire in the office.  It is strange that the insurance company itself violating the terms and conditions of the sub-clause 5 of the regulation No.9 because the claim of the complainant was to be settled within 30 days and reliance on this point can be taken from case laws National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Rajesh Kumar Kaila 2013 (2) CLT 417 (PB) and M/s. Shital International Vs. United India Insurance Company Limited 2012 (1) CLT 326 (pb).  In the present case the fire broke out on 17.3.2012 and the surveyor visited the spot on 18.03.2012 and as per Ex.R4 he had submitted its report on 26.6.2012 and on the basis of which the insurance company had settled the claim of the complainant on 24.05.2013.  The act and conduct of the insurance company
-4-
clearly shows that how it harass and humiliates the consumers despite the fact that the act itself is made only to protect the rights of the consumer.  It was on the insurance to settle the claim expeditiously but in the present case almost 14 months have passed in settling the claim of the complainant which is clear cut violation of the legislation of Act.
Keeping in view all the facts and circumstances we are of the considered opinion that the OP has wrongly and illegally offered the meagre amount of Rs.2,762/- in total by reducing 89.19% for under insurance as mentioned in report of surveyor Ex.R4 in Column A, 66.67% for under insurance as mentioned in report of surveyor Ex.R4 in Column B and 92.50 % for under insurance as mentioned in report of surveyor Ex.R4 in Column C.  The present complaint stands allowed and OP is directed to pay a sum of Rs.80,512/- + Rs.10,750/- + Rs.2,320/- + Rs.11,050/- total amount to Rs.1,21,632/- alongwith interest @ 6 % per annum from the date of institution of this complaint till actual payment.  The OP is further directed to pay Rs.3,000/- on account of cost of litigation and mental harassment etc.  The compliance of this order be made within a period of one month, failing which the complainant is at liberty to initiate the legal proceedings against the respondent – company.  A copy of this order be supplied to the parties free of costs.  File be consigned to record room after due compliance.”
-5-
4.      This order was impugned by the petitioner in its appeal before the State Commission.  Before the State Commission, it was argued that as per the surveyor report,  the stock was to the tune of Rs.13,87,161.88 as per accounts book, whereas stock was insured for 1,50,000/-, so average clause was applied.  The State Commission after hearing the parties and re-appreciating and reassessing the evidences on record held as under :
Para 4 “As per the report it is clear that Gas Stoves, regulator etc. were burnt as alleged by the complainant.  So the company is liable to pay the amount of the articles gutted in the fire and can take the salvage.  Learned District Forum rightly came to the conclusion that complainant was entitled for Rs.1,21,632/- for the loss of article besides compensation qua litigation, mental harassment etc.  However the only thing which should be added in the impugned order dated 04.07.2014 is that the appellant OP-Insurance company will be entitled to take the salvage.  The impugned order is modified accordingly and the appeal is disposed of.”
5.      This order is impugned in the present revision petition.  The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued at length.  It is submitted that the claimant had claimed the loss only for the articles i.e. gas stove and regulator and chairs and tables and he has not claimed damages for other losses, therefore, granting the damages for other article is an exercise beyond the jurisdiction.  It is further argued that as per the insurance policy, the sum insured for the stock was 2 lakh while the surveyor had found
-6-
Stock of more than 13 lakh and, therefore, the policy was under valued and hence the complainant is not entitled for any other amount than the one being offered.  The other argument is that the stock which were burnt were never insured with the petitioner.
6.      The respondent in person has argued that all the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the petitioner are beyond the pleadings on record and have no merit.
7.      I have given thoughtful consideration of the arguments of the learned counsel and the respondent and have perused the record.  The copy of the insurance policy has been placed on record which clearly shows that there were 15 items which were insured vide the relevant insurance policy.  This included godown building, godown stock, office building, office stock, DHB godown stock etc.  The argument of learned counsel that the godown wherein the fire had taken place is not covered by this insurance policy, absolutely has no merit and is contrary to record.  This argument even is against the conduct of the petitioner.  Petitioner had accepted that the place of fire is covered under the policy and that is why it had appointed a surveyor and, thereafter, offered to settle the loss amount.  It is not a case where the petitioner had repudiated the claim stating that the site was not
-7-
covered under the insurance policy.  It is also apparent that this plea has been taken by the learned counsel for the first time before this Commission.  This plea was neither taken in the written version, nor it was taken in the appeal.
8.      Besides, the reasons given by the fora below to grant the relief to the respondent for the losses while rejecting the contention of the petitioner that the insurance was under-valued, there is one more reason to hold that this argument that the policy was under-valued, is meritless.  The learned counsel for the petitioner has based its arguments that the policy was under-valued on the report of the surveyor wherein the surveyor had stated that the value of the stock at the close of 17.03.2012 was Rs.13,87,161.88 while the stock had been insured for Rs.2 lakhs as per item at Sl.No.4 of the policy.  This argument also is meritless what the surveyor had inspected, was the stock lying in the office  building.  The following is the excerpt of the report of the surveyor :
Stocks
“The value of stocks in office at the close of 17.3.2012 i.e. immediately before the fire loss as per account books was Rs.13,87,161.88 (As per copy of trading a/cs encl.) The insured
-8-
had not availed any loan against stocks from any bank and therefore no bank stock statement was available.  Physical verification of the stocks was also carried out and the same were found in agreement with that as per account books.  The market value of office FFF was estimated at Rs.1.50 lacs and that of office building at Rs.20.00 lacs. The book value of FFF as on 31.3.2011 was Rs.6,843/- and that of building Rs.13,87,161.88, 1.50 lacs and 20.00 lacs respectively against insurance of Rs.1.50. 0.50 lac and 1.50 lacs same are grossly under – insured and hence average clause shall be applicable.  Godown building & stock are separately insured.”
9.      Admittedly, the fire had not broken out in the office.  As per the policy, it was the office stock which was valued at Rs.2 lakh when the policy was purchased.  Since fire had not taken place in the office, even if the valuation of the stock lying in the office on that date was under-valued, that could not be a ground for rejection of a claim for the loss occurred in the fire which had taken place in the store room of the top floor of the building.  There is no mention of the surveyor in its report as to the value of the stock as on the close of 17.03.2012 i.e. immediately before the fire, lying in the stores wherein fire had occurred.  From Sl. No.5 of the insurance policy it is apparent that the stock lying in the godowns/store had been valued at Rs.13,50,000/-, and from Sl. No. 2, value of godown stock had been valued at Rs.11,50,000/- .  There is no report of the surveyor that the value of the goods lying in the stores/godowns was much more than the value for which

the stock lying therein was insured.  Therefore, rejection of the claim of the respondent on this count amounts to gross deficiency in service.  The Fora below have granted relief to the complainant on the basis of calculation of the loss occurred to the stock of the complainant/respondent after adjusting the salvage value by the surveyor.
10.    I find no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.  Since on the face of it, it is apparent that the rejection by petitioner was of valid claim contrary to its own document i.e. surveyor report, and this act of the petitioner is against all cannons of justice. They are bound to respect the contract of the insured and promptly pay the payable sum and not to deny the lawful claims on flimsy grounds.  Keeping in view, the petitioner is guilty of gross deficiency in services for the reasons discussed above while dismissing the revision petition, I impose a cost of Rs.25,000/- upon the petitioner.  This amount shall be paid to the complainant/respondent by way of demand draft within eight weeks, failing which the respondent can file an execution petition before the District Forum for the recovery of this amount as well.

For ready appreciation, extract from the appraisal made by the State Commission is reproduced below:
अपीलार्थी बीमा कंपनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता का तर्क है कि जिला फोरम का निर्णय साक्ष्‍य और विधि के विपरीत है। अपीलार्थी बीमा कंपनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता का तर्क है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी का दावा बीमा पालिसी की शर्तों के अंतर्गत नहीं आता है।
प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता का तर्क है कि जिला फोरम द्वारा पारित निर्णय और आदेश पूर्णत: साक्ष्‍य और विधि के अनुकूल है। उनका तर्क है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की मृत्‍यु चुनाव ड्यूटी के दौरान हुई है। अत: प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी अपने पति की बीमित धनराशि पाने की अधिकारी है। प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता ने भारत के चुनाव आयोग का पत्र दिनांक 17.02.2009 बहस के दौरान दिखाया है जिसमें माननीय उच्‍च न्‍यायालय पटना के निर्देशानुसार चुनाव आयोग द्वारा यह निर्देशित किया गया है कि बीमा पालिसी में निम्‍न क्‍लाज बढ़ाया जाए:-
“Before parting with the records of the case, the Court would like to observe that in order to avoid any such controversy in future, the Election Commission must insist on a suitable amendment in the cover clause of MOU. It appears to me that in place of the expression “death only resulting solely and directly from accident caused by external violence and any other visible means” the expressions used in Section 3 of the Workman Compensation Act may be substituted, that is to say, “death arising out of and in the course of election duty”
प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता ने माननीय उच्‍च न्‍यायालय पटना द्वारा रिट नं0 238 आफ 2010 Mostt. Shakuntala Devi@Kunwar v/s The state of Bihar में पारित निर्णय दिनांक 03.07.2014 को भी संदर्भित किया है।
मैंने उभयपक्ष के तर्क पर विचार किया है। प्रश्‍नगत बीमा पालिसी अपील के पृष्‍ठ 33 पर संलग्‍न है जो उभयपक्ष को स्‍वीकार है। इस ग्रुप पर्सनल एक्‍सीडेंट इंश्‍योरेंस पालिसी में अंकित विवरण निम्‍न है:-
""Government employees including security personnel’s, drivers and cleaners of private vehicles deputed by Government of Uttar Pradesh for election duty in Three Tier Panchayat Election-2000 (as per phase wise list submitted by the Election Office) are covered against the risk of death, permanent total disablement and permanent partial disablement due to an accident.""
प्रश्‍नगत ग्रुप पर्सनल एक्‍सीडेंट इंश्‍योरेंस पालिसी से यह स्‍पष्‍ट है कि चुनाव ड्यूटी में लगे कर्मचारियों की मृत्‍यु स्‍थायी अपंगता या स्‍थायी आंशिक अपंगता एक्‍सीडेंट के कारण घटित होने पर ही बीमा धनराशि प्रदान की जानी है। चुनाव आयोग द्वारा सभी राज्‍यों के मुख्‍य सचिव को प्रेषित उपरोक्‍त पत्र दिनांक 17.02.2009 में चुनाव ड्यूटी में लगे कर्मचारियों के बीमा के संदर्भ में एम0ओ0यू0 में संशोधन कर “death arising out of and in the course of election duty” अंकित करने का निर्देश दिया है। जबकि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की मृत्‍यु दिनांक 13.06.2000 को हुई है और प्रश्‍नगत ग्रुप पर्सनल एक्‍सीडेंट इंश्‍योरेंस पालिसी दिनांक 13.06.2000 को चुनाव आयोग के पत्र दिनांक 17.02.2009 के बहुत पहले जारी की गयी है। अत: चुनाव आयोग के इस पत्र का लाभ प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी को नहीं मिल सकता है। Mostt. Shakuntala Devi@Kunwar v/s The state of Bihar के उपरोक्‍त वाद में माननीय उच्‍च न्‍यायालय पटना ने बीमा पालिसी का क्‍लाज 3 उद्धित किया है, जो निम्‍न है:-
“Scope of Cover- The insurance is intended to provide for payment of compensation in the event of death only resulting solely and directly from accident caused by external violence and any other visible means”.
इस निर्णय में माननीय उच्‍च न्‍यायालय पटना ने अंत में निम्‍न निष्‍कर्ष निकाला है:-
“By no stretch of imagination and by no means of interpretation of Annexure-1 it can be said that it covered such cases also where a personnel died on poll duty in normal circumstance. I am of the considered opinion that Annexure-1 did not cover cases of natural death of personnel dying on poll duty.”
परिवादपत्र में यह अभिकथित नहीं किया गया है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की मृत्‍यु दुर्घटना में हुई थी। परिवादपत्र में मात्र यह उल्‍लेख है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की चुनाव ड्यूटी के दौरान दिनांक 13.06.2000 को मृत्‍यु हो गयी। प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की दुर्घटना मृत्‍यु होने के सम्‍बन्‍ध में कोई साक्ष्‍य भी पत्रावली पर नहीं है। इसके विपरीत बहस के दौरान प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के विद्वान अधिवक्‍ता ने यह स्‍वीकार किया है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी के पति की मृत्‍यु आकस्मिक ह्दय गति रूकने से हुई है।
माननीय सर्वोच्‍च न्‍यायालय ने जनरल एश्‍योरेंस सोसायटी लि0 बनाम चन्‍दूमल जैन A.I.R,1966 S.C.1644 के वाद में कहा है कि:-
“In interpreting documents relating to a contract of insurance, the duty of the court is to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties because it is not for the court to make a new contract, however reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves.”
परिवादपत्र के कथन से यह स्‍पष्‍ट है कि प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी को उसके पति की चुनाव ड्यूटी के दौरान मृत्‍यु हेतु मानवाधिकार आयोग के आदेश से  1,00,000/-रू0 की क्षतिपूर्ति 80,000/-रू0 तथा 20,000/-रू0 के दो चेकों के माध्‍यम से प्रदान की गयी है। यह धनराशि उ0प्र0 सरकार द्वारा दी गयी है, बीमा कंपनी द्वारा नहीं।
उभयपक्षों के अभिकथन एवं सम्‍पूर्ण तथ्‍यों और परिस्थितियों तथा माननीय उच्‍च न्‍यायालय पटना के उपरोक्‍त निर्णय और भारत के चुनाव आयोग के पत्र दिनांक 17.02.2009 पर विचार करते हुए मैं इस मत का हूं कि अपीलार्थी/विपक्षी बीमा कंपनी की प्रश्‍नगत ग्रुप पर्सनल एक्‍सीडेंट इंश्‍योरेंस पालिसी के अंतर्गत अपीलार्थी/विपक्षी बीमा कंपनी प्रत्‍यर्थी/परिवादिनी को उसके पति की मृत्‍यु हेतु क्षतिपूर्ति की अदायगी हेतु उत्‍तरदायी नहीं है और जिला फोरम ने जो आक्षेपित निर्णय और आदेश पारित किया है वह बीमा पालिसी के विपरीत है।
उपरोक्‍त निष्‍कर्षों के आधार पर अपील स्‍वीकार की जाती है और जिला फोरम द्वारा पारित आक्षेपित निर्णय और आदेश अपास्‍त करते हुए परिवाद निरस्‍त किया जाता है।
धारा-15 उपभोक्‍ता संरक्षण अधिनियम के अंतर्गत अपील में जमा धनराशि ब्‍याज सहित अपीलार्थी को वापिस की जाए।
8.     The short point in the case is that the insured expired due to sudden cardiac arrest on 13.06.2000; the “Miscellaneous Accident Insurance Policy” covered government employees including security personnel, drivers and cleaners during the course of discharge of election duty against “the risk of death, permanent total disablement and permanent partial disablement due to an accident”; that is to say, the assured amount under the said policy was payable in the event of death, permanent total disablement and permanent partial disablement due to an accident.
The said “Miscellaneous Accident Insurance Policy” was a ‘Group Personal Accident Insurance Policy’ taken to cover government employees deputed to discharge election duty against risk(s) due to accident, nothing more.
No categorical averment has been made that the insured died due to an accident during the course of discharge of election duty in the Complaint.
No evidence has been placed on the record to show that the insured died due to an accident during the course of discharge of election duty.
The onus of proving accidental death during the course of discharge of election duty was on the Complainant, which onus she failed to discharge.
9.     The District Forum erred in appreciating the facts and evidence, and arrived at erroneous findings.
On the other hand, the State Commission made a correct appreciation of the facts and evidence, and passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible. Its Order of 30.08.2017 calls for no interference.
","10.   Sequel to the above discussion, the Revision Petition is dismissed, the State Commission’s Order dated 30.08.2017 is upheld and sustained.

1.     This Revision Petition has been filed under Section 21(b) of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 25.08.2014 of The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’, in F.A. No. 984 of 2013 arising out of the Order dated 16.07.2013 in C.C. No. 74 of 2013 passed by The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Hoshiarpur, hereinafter referred to as the ‘District Forum’.
2.     The Petitioner herein, Mr Ashok Kumar, was the Complainant before the District Forum, and is hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Complainant’.
The Respondent herein, National Insurance Company Limited, was the Opposite Party before the District Forum, and is hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Insurance Co.’.
3.     Heard learned Counsel for the Complainant and the Insurance Co., and perused the record including inter alia the Order dated 16.07.2013 of the District Forum, the impugned Order dated 25.08.2014 of the State Commission and the Memorandum of Petition.
4.     The dispute relates to repudiation of an accident claim on the insured vehicle.
5.     The District Forum, vide its Order dated 16.07.2013, partly allowed the Complaint. However, the State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 25.08.2014, allowed the Appeal and dismissed the Complaint.
6.     It is admitted, and not disputed, that 20% No Claim Bonus (NCB) on the premium was taken by the Complainant while renewing his insurance policy; the Complainant made an explicit and unequivocal declaration to the effect that no claim had arisen in the previous policy year; on inquiry, however, it was subsequently detected by the Insurance Co. that he had taken a claim of Rs.3471/- in the previous policy year and as such he was not entitled for the said 20% No Claim Bonus for the next policy year.
7.     The contention raised in arguments that the NCB Declaration was signed by the Complainant on the say-so of the agent is not tenable. An NCB Declaration has pecuniary implications, it has to be signed truthfully, with eyes open.
8.     The State Commission has rightly observed in para 9/10 of its Order that:
9.       We have heard the counsel for the parties.
10.     It is an admitted fact that the complainant had taken the policy for the period from 31.03.2012 to 30.03.2013 and previous year policy was also taken from the appellant company. He had taken the claim during the previous year amounting to Rs.3471/- regarding claim No. of taking the policy he received no claim bonus to which he was not entitled. He had further given wrong declaration in the proposal form which is on record as Ex. OP-6 which reads as under:-
NCB Declaration
Declare that Rate of N.C.B. claimed by me/us is correct and that no claim has arisen in the policy period. I/We further undertake that if this Declaration is found to be incorrect, benefits under the policy in respect of Section 1 of the policy will stand forfeited.
This declaration was found to be incorrect and as per section 1 of the policy, it will stand forfeited.
(emphasis supplied)
9.     Another contention raised in arguments that the Complainant, then, subsequently, paid the requisite amount of Rs. 2,119/- as additional premium to keep his policy valid is also not tenable. On the relevant date, i.e. on the date of the accident, the policy suffered from the infirmities of concealment of the material fact of a claim having been taken in the previous year and of an untruthful NCB Declaration. Moreover, in the letter dated 17.01.2013 from the Insurance Co. it was clearly communicated to the Complainant that “You have further agreed that in the event of declaration having been found false or there is any suppression/concealment of any fact the insurance contract pertaining to the said vehicle shall be void and will no have any effect and all rights to recover there, in respect of past or future claims shall be forfeited” and “Moreover your said policy is valid upto 30-03-2013 and there may be possibility of loss in future. So, deposit NCB being short premium to make contract valid for future. (emphasis supplied)”. On payment of the deficit premium, the policy was to be made valid prospectively, “for future”.
10.   The State Commission has rightly observed in para 10 of its Order that:
10.     A reference has been made to the letter dated 17.01.2013 Ex. OP-1 vide which the complainant was asked to give the explanation why he had given the wrong declaration and claimed 20% no claim bonus and he was further asked that his policy is valid upto 30.03.2013 and that there may be possibility of loss in future. So deposit NCB being short premium to make contract valid in future. In the case the complainant returned the amount of no claim bonus, then his policy has been made valid for the remaining period. His policy from the date of inception was on the basis of wrong declaration by claiming no claim bonus in an illegal manner and accordingly his claim was repudiated. Repudiation is legal one according to the terms and conditions of the policy.- - -
(emphasis supplied)
11.   The District Forum erred in not appraising the evidence correctly. Specifically, it erred in not appreciating that [a] on the relevant date, i.e. on the date of the accident, the policy suffered from the infirmities of concealment of the material fact of a claim having been taken in the previous year and of an untruthful NCB Declaration, [b] the making good of the deficit premium was made only and only after the untruthful declaration was detected and [c] paying the deficit premium made the insurance policy valid prospectively, “for future”, and did not in any way retrospectively condone the untruthful NCB declaration and the short payment of premium made at the time of renewal of the insurance policy.
12.   The State Commission has correctly appraised the case, no jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible. Its Order of 25.08.2014 calls for no interference.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
A consumer complaint was instituted by respondent Nos.1, 2 & 3 against several entities, including the appellant company. The consumer complaint was allowed by the State Commission  by directing payment of compensation quantified at Rs.10 lakhs to the complainants. Cross appeals against the order of the State Commission   were preferred before this Commission and were disposed of vide order dated 28.9.2012. This Commission directed payment of compensation amounting to Rs.12,80,000/- to the complainants, out of which Rs.10 lakhs were to be paid by the insurer. In compliance of the order passed by this Commission, the appellant deposited a sum of Rs.7,80,000/- with the State Commission  alongwith interest amounting to Rs.722964/- thereby making a total sum of Rs.1502964/-. A sum of Rs.144593/- was deducted by the appellant towards income tax at source on the interest component of Rs.722964/-. The case of the complainant is that no income tax could have been deducted on the interest paid to them whereas the case of the insurer is that income tax was rightly deducted in view of the legal requirement of Section 194A of the Income Tax Act.
2.      The State Commission  having held in favour of the complainants, the insurer is before this Commission. Thus, the only dispute involved in this appeal is whether the interest could have been deducted on the amount of Rs.722964/- paid by way of interest and if so, what should have been the rate of income tax to be deducted at source.
3.      As noted earlier, the amount deposited by the appellant with the State Commission  had two components. One component would be the principal amount awarded to the complainants and the other component was the interest on the compensation. Though the income tax may not be deductible at source from the compensation, the compensation not being an income it was, in my opinion, certainly deductible on the interest which was paid to the complainants on the compensation awarded by this Commission. This is not the case where income tax had been deducted on the compensation paid to the complainants. Here, the income tax has been deducted only on the interest which this Commission had awarded on the compensation amount.
4.      Coming to the rate at which income tax could be deducted, the relevant provision required deduction of income tax at source @ 20% p.a in case PAN Card was not provided by the payee of the interest. The income tax at source was deductible @ 10% p.a. where PAN Card was provided by the payee to the deductor. There is no evidence of the appellant bank having asked the complainants to submit their PAN Card. Admittedly, the complainants did possess the PAN Card which was filed before the District Forum. Had the appellant company required the complainants to submit a copy of the PAN Card, there is no reason why they would not have provided the same to the appellant company. Therefore, the appellant, in my opinion, was not justified in deducting income tax at source @ 20% p.a. and the same ought to have been deducted only @ 10% p.a.
","5.      The appellant having deducted excess income tax, it is liable to pay that amount to the complainants though it would be at liberty to claim refund of the amount from Income Tax Department if it is otherwise entitled to such a refund. Therefore, the appeal is disposed of by directing the appellant company to refund amount of Rs.72,296.50/- (50% of Rs.144593/-) to the complainants within eight weeks from today failing which, the said amount shall carry interest @ 9% p.a. from  the date of this order. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)

The sale consideration for the apartment, including one covered car parking, was agreed at Rs. 20,60,000/-. After completion of the construction, the appellant sent an intimation dated 23.02.2012 to the complainant informing him that the flat and car parking was ready for possession. He was requested to visit the flat, satisfy himself regarding its condition extra and take possession. The said letter also contained a demand of Rs. 6,23,218/- as detailed below:-
1.         Amount due on possession                                   Rs. 2,00,000/-

i.e. 1345 sq. ft. X Rs. 200                                        Rs. 2,69,000/-
6.         Cost of Registration fees.                                       Rs.   30,876/-
7.         Attornment charges @ 2%             Rs. 56,138/-
Less: Received earlier                    Rs. 20,746/- Rs.   35,392/-
TOTAL                                    Rs. 6,23,218/-
2.        On receipt of the said letter, the complainant made payment of Rs. 4,29,218/- to the appellant. The appellant issued receipt dated 19.05.2012 the complainant while receiving the aforesaid payment. The receipt to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
“Received with thanks from Mr. Sanjay Kr. Bharatiya a sum of Rs. 4,29,218/- (Rs. Four lacs twenty nine thousand two hundred and eighteen only)  by pay order No. 704885 dated 18.5.12 for Rs. 4,15,000/- drawn on SBI, New Alipore Br and Rs. 14218/- in cash towards cost of flat being SSHA/5 and garage being No. SSHA/G/2 as remaining dues and other cost as below as per settlement in full and final subject to encashment of the pay order:-
1.         Possession amount of flat                              Rs. 2,00,000/-
2.         Cost of extra civil work (as settled)            Rs.   50,000/-
3.         Deposit after house tax                               Rs.      5,000/-
4.         Extra electrical job                                        Rs.     7,950/-
5.         Price escalation (as settled)                       Rs. 1,00,000/-
6.         Registration fee                                            Rs.      30,876/-
7.         Attornment inputs                                        Rs.     35,392/-
Rs. 4,29,218/-
3.      After paying of the above referred Rs. 4,29,218/-  the complainant approached the concerned state Commission by way of a consumer complaint alleging therein that:
(1) the appellant had forcibly collected Rs. 1,00,000/- towards escalation of price;
(2)     the actual size of the flat was less by 98 square feet and
(3)     the area of the car parking was deficient.
4.      The appellant contested the consumer complaint denying recovery of any excess payment from the complainant. The alleged shortage in the area of the flat and the car parking was also denied.
5.      The State Commission vide its impugned order dated 20.11.2017 directed as under:-
“On evaluation of materials on record, I find that the complainant being a ‘consumer’ as defined in Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act hired the services of OP on payment of money but the OP has shown negligence or deficiency in services towards the complainant in accordance with Section 2(1)(g) read with Section 2(1)(o) of the Act and as such the complainant is entitled to reliefs as prayed for.  Considering the facts and circumstances, I think a direction upon the opposite party to execute and register the Sale Deed and to handover completion certificate in respect of subject flat and the covered demarcated car parking space, to refund Rs.1,00,000/- received as escalation price of flat Rs. 50,000/- for extra civil work, Rs.1,50,000/- as shortfall of 98 sq. ft. will meet the ends of justice.  Besides the same, the complainant is also entitled to compensation for harassment and mental agony which I quantify at Rs.1.00,000/-.  As the situation compelled the complainant to come before this Commission, he is also entitled litigation cost which I assess at Rs.10,000/-.
","Consequently, the petition of complaint is allowed on contest with cost of Rs.10,000/-.
The Opposite Party is directed to execute and register the Sale Deed and also hand over Completion Certificate in respect of flat and demarcated covered car parking space in favour of the complainant within 30 days from date.  The OP is also directed to pay Rs.1,00,000/- received as escalation price + Rs. 50,000/- as extra civil work + Rs.1,50,000/- for less saleable area of 98 sq. ft. + Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation + Rs.10,000/- as litigation cost = Rs.4,10,000/- in favour of the complainant within 30 days from date otherwise the amount shall carry interest @ 9% p.a. from date till its realisation.”
6.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission appellant is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
7.      As far as the area of the apartment is concerned a Court Commissioner was appointed by this Commission to visit the flat allotted to the complainant and measure its area. In his report the Court Commissioner has inter alia stated that there was no deficit in the area of the flat. Therefore, the grievance of the complainant with respect to area of the flat is not sustainable.
8.      As regards the car parking, no size of the said car parking was given in the application form which the complainant has submitted to the appellant. But in the draft deed of conveyance the area of the car parking given it given as 96 square feet. Since there is no document to show that the appellant had agreed to provide a car parking having area of more than 96 square feet to the complainant it would be difficult to say that the area actually provided to him is less than what had been agreed between the parties. Therefore, the grievance on account of the alleged deficit in the area of the car parking is also not justified.
9.      As regards the demand of Rs. 2,69,000/- on account of price escalation, a perusal of the application form itself would show that at the time of applying for the allotment itself the complainant had agreed that in case any major hike in the prices of construction materials such as cement, steel etc, the selling price maybe commensurately revised with prior intimation to the buyers. The case of the appellant is that there was a substantial increase in the cost of construction and cost of labour but they had asked allottees to share only a part of the increase by asking them to pay at the rate of Rs. 200/- per square feet. This was stated so in the letter dated 23.02.2012 whereby the complainant was required to pay a sum of Rs.6,23,218/- to the appellant. The complainant responded to the above-referred letter dated 23.02.2012 on 19.05.2012, stating therein that he was fully satisfied with the conditions quality etc. of the flat and he agreed to the conditions mentioned in the intimation letter dated 23.02.2012 in toto. Thus, by way of his letter dated 19.05.2012 the complainant accepted the demand on account of price escalation ar the rate of Rs. 200/- per square feet amounting to Rs. 2,69,000/-.
10.    As regards cost of  extra civil work, though the details of the alleged extra civil work have not been given in the written version filed by the appellant, the fact remains that the complainant by letter dated 19.05.2012 agreed to pay the said cost of extra civil work when he expressly stated that all the conditions mentioned in the letter dated 23.02.2012 were acceptable to him in toto.
11.    Even after accepting the demand raised vide letter dated 23.02.2012 the complainant negotiated with the appellant and paid only a  sum  of  Rs. 4,29,218/- to  the  Appellant  against  the  demand  of  Rs. 6,23,218/-. In the hand-written  receipt  it has  been  clearly  stated  that the payment of Rs. 4,15,000/- by way of pay order and Rs.14218/-  in cash was made by the complainant as the remaining dues and other cost as per settlement in full and final, subject to encashment of the pay order. This receipt clearly shows that there had been a settlement between the parties whereby the complainant agreed to pay to the  appellant and the appellant agreed to accept a sum of Rs.4,29,218/- against the demand of rupees 6,23,218/- contained in the letter dated 23.02.2012. Therefore, the complainant cannot be allowed to have grievance with respect to the price escalation and the cost of the extra civil work in his flat.
12.    For the reasons stated herein above, the state commission, in my opinion, was not justified in directing appellant to refund Rs. 1,00,000/- received as escalation price, Rs. 50,000/- received for extra civil work and Rs. 1,50,000/- on account of shortfall in the area of the flat. Consequently there would be no justification even for awarding any compensation to the complainant who had received possession of the allotted flat from the appellant before instituting the consumer complaint.
13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned order cannot be sustained and is set aside. The consumer complaint consequently stands dismissed with no orders as to costs. However, the sale deed unless already executed shall be executed within two weeks from today.

  For the Petitioner     :Ms. Deepa Chacko, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. V.S. Chopra, Advocate 
","1.      The present Revision Petition, under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) has been filed by the Petitioners against order dated 24.07.2013 of the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Aurangabad (for short “State Commission”) in First Appeal No.287/2012 wherein the Appeal filed by the Appellants/Petitioners was dismissed.
2.   Shree Ambemata Industries is a small scale industrial unit processing and manufacturing CTD iron bars/rods, located at Plot No. A-5/1, Additional MIDC Area, Jalna. The case of the Complainants relates to alleged deficiency in service on the part of the Insurance Company for non-settlement of their claim for damages caused to their unit, due to fall of  “Garpit” in Jalna city on 08.04.2002. Complainant No.1/Partnership firm was insured, vide Policy No.1116050101828/029 for the period 27.07.2001 to 26.07.2002. On receipt of information about the incident the Respondent/Insurance Company appointed a Surveyor, who visited the Complainant unit and assessed the loss. Against a claim of Rs.10 lakhs, the Respondent/Insurance Company settled the claim at Rs.87,976/- and deposited the amount in Central Bank of India, Industrial Branch, Jalna. Thereafter, the Complainants continuously followed-up the matter and demonstrated to the Insurance Company that there was a total damage to plant, machinery & building, but the loss had not been assessed and settled. The Insurance Company settled the claims of other policy holders but in their case, in collusion with the outgoing members of the firm, failed to settle the matter despite the survey report being in their favour. Aggrieved by the alleged inaction on the part of the Respondent/Insurance Company, a Consumer Complaint was filed in the District Forum with the following prayer: -
“A.   To call for the record and proceedings of the case.
B.   To direct the respondent Insurance Company to settle the claim of the complainant no. 1 by offering an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- after adjusting the amount already paid for in making the part payment of the claim raised for with the penal interest at the rate of 18% per annum from 08-04-2002 till its realisation.
C.   Or in the alternative, the respondent Insurance Company be directed to pay the aggravated losses and damages as per their own admission and to pay a sum of Rs.17,40,000/-to the complainant no.1 alongwith the penal interest at the rate of 18% per annum from 10-08-2003 till its realisation after adjusting the amount already paid for in part settlement of the claim.
D.  To pass any other just and equitable relief in the interest of                  justice.
E.   Costs of the complaint be awarded.”
3.      In reply to the Complaint, the Respondent/Insurance Company submitted that after receiving intimation about the loss caused to the Complainants due to heavy rain and hailstorm, a Surveyor was appointed, who visited the spot and assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.87,976/-. As per the said assessment, Insurance Company issued full and final settlement voucher which was signed by Shri Gopichand Shekhavatrai Dembda and the Complainants were, therefore, not entitled to any further claim.
4.      The District Forum after hearing both the parties and perusing the record dismissed the Complaint. The District Forum held that
“Looking at the documents of complaint it appears that as per the report dated 18/8/2002 of surveyor Shri Sampat Jayant a sum of Rs.87,976/- has been correctly approved towards compensation and was deposited the bank account with Central Bank of India. The complainant did not produce any concrete evidence of sustaining loss more than this amount before the Forum. Under this situation no lapse in service on the part of non-applicant insurance company is seen.
Hence the Redressal Forum is passing the following order:
ORDER
1.The complaint of the complainant is hereby dismissed.
2. There is no order regarding the cost.”
6.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, Complainants/Petitioners preferred an Appeal before the State Commission. The State Commission concurred with the finding of the District Forum and dismissed the Appeal with a cost of Rs.2000/-. Order of the State Commission reads as follows: -
“In our considered opinion we find that District Forum rightly considered all the facts and evidence while dismissing the complaint. There is no illegality or infirmity occurred in the judgment and order of Forum. Hence the following order
ORDER
","1.      The Appeal is dismissed
2.      Complaint stands dismissed.
3.      Appellant to pay Rs.2000/- as cost to the respondent in appeal.
7.      Against the order of the State Commission, Petitioners have preferred the present Revision Petition.
8.      Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the Insurance Company appointed a Surveyor who inspected the premises and submitted his report to the effect that there was a major damage to the shed, office building, watchman cabin and machineries. It was submitted that immediately after the incident, the revenue authorities carried out spot Panchnama on 11.04.2002 and assessed the loss at Rs.8,56,000/-. The Insurance Company relied on the discharge voucher signed by a retired partner Mr. Gopichand Shekhavatrai Demba, without any rubber stamp of the Petitioner unit. The said discharge voucher was forged and fabricated and could not come in the way of the Complainants to file the Consumer Complaint before the Consumer Forum.
9.      Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Insurance Company submitted that there was no deficiency in service on their part as they fulfilled their obligation under the contract of insurance as per its terms and conditions. It was submitted that the discharge voucher had been duly signed by the representative of the Central Bank of India, Jalna and a partner of the insured firm, accepting an amount of Rs.87,976/- as full and final settlement and the said amount had been released to Central Bank of India, who had taken the insurance policy. The Petitioner had intentionally not impleaded Central Bank of India as a party. The Revenue Authorities did visit the unit of Complainant on 11.04.2002. The Panchnama, however, was forged and fabricated and made in collusion with the Complainants. Respondent Company appointed a Surveyor/Loss Accessor and directed him to visit the unit and submit his report. The Surveyor made a detailed enquiry about the loss caused to the Complainants. The Surveyor, carried out inspection in the presence of representatives of the Complainants and after perusing the documentary record, assessed the loss caused to the Complainants to a tune of Rs.88,000/-.
10.    Heard learned Counsel for the parties and carefully perused the record. Shree Ambemata Industries is a small scale industrial unit processing and manufacturing CTD iron bars/rods. It is a registered partnership firm with its factory located at A-5/1, Addl. MIDC Area, Jalna. The Respondent issued a Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy No.1116050101828/029 for the period 27.07.2001 to 26.07.2002 for a sum assured of Rs.24,50,000/-. The insurance policy was obtained towards security of the loan obtained from Central Bank of India. On 08.04.2002 there was a hailstorm which damaged the insured premises. The incident was reported to the Revenue Authorities who drew a panchnama and assessed the loss approximately at Rs.8,56,000/-. Nearly a month later the loss was intimated to the Insurance Company, vide letter dated 13.05.2002. A claim was lodged with the Insurance Company for Rs.10 lakhs. The Respondent/Insurance Company on receipt of the claim proposal of the Complainants appointed a Surveyor to assess the loss. Surveyor pointed out that unit was established in 1995 and lasted upto 1997. The unit defaulted in repaying the loan of Rs.10 lakhs obtained from Central Bank of India, Jalna. The Surveyor appointed by the Insurance Company assessed the loss at about Rs.86,976/- and the same was paid to the Complainants in the name of Central Bank of India, Industrial Branch, Jalna and the Complainants received the compensation towards full and final settlement of the claim lodged. The discharge voucher had been signed by Central Bank of India, Jalna and a partner of the Complainant firm, accepting the payment of Rs.87,976/- as full and final settlement. It is also surprising that the Central Bank of India has not been impleaded as a party, though the Bank had taken the insurance policy and was a party receiving payment towards full and final settlement of the claim. The District Forum held that the Complainants did not produce any concrete evidence sustaining loss more than the amount awarded by the District Forum. There was no lapse on the part of the Insurance Company. According to the State Commission, though Mr. Gopichand Shekhavatrai Dembda retired from the firm in the year 1996, no documentary evidence to that effect was produced by the Petitioners. Information in that regard was given by Assistant Registrar, Partnership Firm only in the year 2005. Even after receipt of full and final settlement, the Petitioners did not record any protest with the Insurance Company. No publication in respect of retirement of Mr. Gopichand Shekhavatrai Dembda seemed to have been made. Both the Fora below held that that sufficient evidence could not be produced by the Complainants to justify settlement of claim made by the Complainants. The Respondent Insurance Company was not informed about the retirement of the partner. The averment of the Petitioners that Mr. Gopichand Shekhavatrai Dembda retired in the year 1996 was not proved by any cogent evidence. Moreover Mr. Gopichand Shekhavatrai Dembda was the father of Petitioner No.2, who had signed the full and final settlement. No civil or criminal proceedings were filed by the partnership firm. Having accepted the full and final settlement of the claim amount, the Complainants are estopped from filing the present Complaint.
11.    Jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21 (b) is very limited. This Commission is not required to re-appreciate and reassess the evidences. The Court can intervene only when the petitioner succeeds in showing that the Fora below has wrongly exercised their jurisdiction or there is a miscarriage of justice. It was so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC 269  as under: -
“13.   Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal  principle  that  was  ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
12.    Same principle has been reiterated by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H & R Johnson (India) Ltd. and Ors. (2016 8 SCC 286 wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
“23. The  National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in their or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
13.    In view of the above, we find no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings of both the Fora below. Petitioners have failed to point any illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the State Commission, warranting interference in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Revision Petition is accordingly dismissed.

  For the Respondent      :
","JUSTICE V. K. JAIN (ORAL)
1.      The Respondent/Complainant sent several consignments containing saris, etc., to different places, from Ajmer. The consignment worth about Rs.3,00,000/- having not been delivered, the Complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint impleading the Manager, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd. as the Opposite Parties in the Complaint. The Company, namely, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd. was not impleaded as Opposite Party in the Consumer Complaint. The first Opposite Party in the Complaint was Manager, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd., 2E/8, Jhandewalan Extension, New Delhi whereas second Opposite Party in the Complaint was Manager, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd., Shop No.36, Basement, Ajmer Tower, Ajmer.
2.      The name of the Opposite Party No.1 was later deleted by the Complainant and the said deletion was allowed vide Order dated 12-07-2016. The notice sent to Opposite Party No.2 having been received back with the endorsement of refusal on 19-03-2016, the District Forum proceeded ex parte against the said Opposite Party and decided the Consumer Complaint on 19-07-2016 directing the Opposite Party which would mean the Manager, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd., Shop No.36, Basement, Ajmer Tower, Ajmer, to pay the price of the saris amounting to Rs.3,00,725/- to the Complainant, along with compensation quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- and the costs of litigation quantified at Rs.5,000/-.
3.      Being aggrieved from the Order of the District Forum, the Petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an Appeal. The said Appeal having been dismissed, the Petitioner is before this Commission.
4.      It is an undisputed position that the goods were sent by the Complainant through a Company, namely, Blaze Flash Courier Ltd.. A Company being an independent legal entity, the Consumer Complaint ought to have been instituted only against the said Company. The Complainant, however, chose to implead the Manager of the Company giving the address as Shop No.36, Basement, Ajmer Tower, Kachachari Road, Ajmer, 305001. As noted earlier, there was no representation either on behalf of the Petitioner or on behalf of the Company, which resulted in the District Forum proceeding ex parte against the Petitioner.
5.      The submission of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, namely, Mr. S. C. Meena is that he was only an employee of Blaze Flash Courier Ltd.. He resigned from the said Company on 30-04-2014 and, thereafter, he became a franchise of another Company, namely, On Dot Courier Ltd. though the business of courier was continued to be carried in Shop No.36, Basement, Ajmer Tower, Kachachari Road, Ajmer, 305001.
6.      Irrespective of whether the Petitioner, namely, Mr. S. C. Meena had resigned as an employee of Blaze Flash Courier Ltd. or he continues to be its employee, the Consumer Complaint could not have been instituted against him. The Complaint could have been instituted only against Blaze Flash Courier Ltd.. The Order passed by Fora below, therefore, has to be taken as an Order directing Blaze Flash Courier Ltd., to make payment of Rs.3,00,725/- along with compensation and costs of litigation in terms of the Order of the District Forum. The said Order cannot be enforced against the Petitioner even if he continues to be an employee of Blaze Flash Courier Ltd..
","7.      The Revision Petition is, therefore, disposed of with the clarification that the Orders passed by the Fora below shall not be enforced personally against the Petitioner, Mr. S. C. Meena, though the said Order can be enforced against Blaze Flash Courier Ltd..

","First Appeal No.12 of 2016 has been filed by the Appellant M/s.Dharmanandan Dismonds Pvt. Ltd. against the order dated 30.10.2015 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Gujarat (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Complaint No.40/2007 and First Appeal No.36 of 2016 has been filed by the appellant New India Assurance Co. Ltd. against the order dated 30.10.2015 of the State Commission, Gujarat passed in Complaint No.40/2007.
2.       Brief facts of the case are that complainant M/s.Dharmanandan Dismonds Pvt. Ltd. has given diamonds to one commission agent Mr. Arjanbhai Mangukia to show the diamonds to the prospective buyers by issuing janghad slip on 10.06.2002.  However, on 11.06.2002, it was informed by the police that Mr. Arjanbhai Mangukia was murdered and he did not possess the diamonds.  On 11.06.2002 the complaint was lodged with the police.  On 12.6.2002, the Insurance Company was also informed about the incident.  The police did not lodge the FIR and therefore, criminal complaint was lodged with Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. The claim for Rs.78,62,388/- was lodged with the Insurance Company.  The Insurance Company appointed a surveyor who has assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.55,19,316/- .  The Insurance Company repudiated the claim on the following grounds on 19.07.2007:-
“1.  The absence of safe at the Brokers premises is a breach of warranty material to the loss, as the loss could have been averted had the packets of diamonds been kept in a standard safe.
2. The change of address was not made in the policy.  This is crucial for the loss as the entrustment was made from the new address, which was not covered by the policy.”
3.      The complainant then filed a consumer complaint before the State Commission being complaint no.40 of 2007.  The complaint was resisted by the Insurance Company on the same grounds on which the repudiation letter was issued.  However, the State Commission allowed the complaint and passed the following order:-
“1. Complainant’s complaint is partially allowed.
2. Insurance Company is hereby ordered to pay applicant Rs.55,19,316/- i.e. Rs.Fifty five lacs Nineteen thousand three hundred sixteen in words with 9% interest from the date of repudiation.
3.  Opponent Insurance Company is also ordered to pay Rs.5000/- towards the cost of complaint.”
4.      Both the parties filed appeals against the order dated 30.10.2015 of the State Commission passed in complaint No.40/2007.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record.  The parties are being referred to as complainant and the opposite party for clarity.  The learned counsel for the opposite party/ Insurance Company stated that the commission agents are covered under Section II of the Policy and the following warranty is mentioned for this Section:-
“Warranted that if insured property with any one person specified in Section II of the schedule exceeds Rs.2 Lacs, the same shall be placed in an inbuilt locker of a steel cupboard.  But if the property exceeds Rs.10 Lacs it must necessarily be secured in a safe of standard make.”
6.      From the above warranty, it is clear that the insured property was required to be kept in a safe lock of a standard make.  The commission agent has been murdered at Mumbai residence and the insured property has not been recovered from there. It means that the insured property was not kept inside a safe lock as required under the warranty clause.  It was also argued by the learned counsel that it was not correct to say that commission agent was to return the insured property by the evening of the same day.  The complaint in the consumer complaint has itself mentioned the following:-
“10. Arjanbhai used to travel regularly in the morning from Surat to Mumbai and use to stay in Mumbai from Monday to Saturday and for his stay he rented one small Mezanine compartment, 306, 3rd Floor, Building No.42/276, Nanubhai Desai Marg, Suttar Gali, Mumbai-4 and he used to stay there alone from Monday to Saturday and used to have food on different lodges and on Friday or Saturday evening he used to return home to Surat and stay with his family.”
7.      In para 6 of the complaint, the complainant has mentioned that the commission agent takes the diamond and returns the same on the same day by evening.  These two averments made in the complaint are contradictory to each other.  The complainant had admitted that the commission agent Mr. Arjanbhai Mangukia was staying at Mumbai residence for five days and that he was coming back to Surat on weekends.  Thus, it was not possible for the commission agent to have come back and to have returned the insured property on the same day.  Thus, if the case property was to be kept for more time at the residence of commission agent at Mumbai, it was required to be kept in the safe as per the warranty clause.  This warranty has been clearly breached and therefore, the claim is not payable.  Though, the surveyor has assessed the loss, however, the surveyor has not given any observation on the adherence to the warranty clause.  Clearly, the surveyor has omitted his comment on warranty either purposely or inadvertently, therefore, fact of assessment of the loss by the surveyor cannot be read in favour of the complainant.
8.      Learned counsel further stated that the complainant in para 4 of the complaint has clearly mentioned that they were taking the insurance from the opposite party since 1999 and then the complainant cannot say that they were not aware about the terms and conditions of the policy.  Moreover, this condition relating to warranty is mentioned in the first two pages of the policy, which has been admittedly received by the complainant.  Learned counsel relied on the following judgements in support of his argument:-
1.      United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. M/s. Orient Treasures Pvt. Ltd., Civil Appeal No.2140 of 2007, decided on 13.01.2016 (SC).  It has been held that:-
42)  It is a settled rule of interpretation that when the words of a statute are clear, plain or unambiguous, i.e., they are reasonably susceptible to only one meaning, the courts are bound to give effect to that meaning irrespective of consequences. In other words, when a language is plain and unambiguous and admits of only one meaning, no question of construction of a statute arises, for the Act speaks for itself. Equally well-settled rule of interpretation is that whenever the NOTE is appended to the main Section, it is explanatory in nature to the main Section and explains the true meaning of the main Section and has to be read in the context of main Section (See - G.P.Singh -Principle of Statutory Interpretation 13th Edition page 50 and 172). This analogy, in our considered opinion, equally applies while interpreting the words used in any contract.”
2. RP No.429 of 2017, Aman Kapoor Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & 2 ors., decided on 17.04.2017 (NC).  It has been held that:
“24. Another plea has been taken by the petitioner/complainant that he was not aware of the terms and conditions of the policy as the same had never been supplied to him. This too has been taken into account by the State Commission which has found itself unable to accept this plea on the ground that there seems to have been no effort on the part of the petitioner/complainant to obtain a copy of the terms and conditions. We are inclined to also agree with this view. We further contend that it is incumbent upon the consumer to be an informed and responsible consumer in order to be able to avail of relief under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Ignorance of terms and conditions of the policy is no excuse and provides no shelter to the petitioner complainant.”
9.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the complainant stated that the warranty in respect of keeping the insured property in lock safe cannot be adhered to when the diamonds were given to broker or commission agent as they have to show the diamonds to different customers and they return the diamond to the firm on the same day.  In the present case, the commission agent was murdered between 7:30 -9:30 pm and police did not recover the diamonds from him.  Had the commission agent been alive, he would have returned the diamonds the same day.  In these circumstances, the application of warranty is not possible in the present case.
10.    It was further argued that the surveyor appointed by the Insurance Company has clearly recommended that the assessed loss of Rs.55,19,316/- is payable to the complainant.  The surveyor has not recorded breach of any warranty, rather the surveyor has found the insurer as liable to pay this amount.  The State Commission has accordingly rightly accepted the report of the surveyor and has partly allowed the claim of the complainant.  The appeal by the complainant has been filed for enhancement of the compensation as the compensation was filed for Rs.78,62,388/-, but the State Commission has awarded Rs.55,19,316/-.  If the Insurance Company was not satisfied with the report of the surveyor as the surveyor had not allegedly indicated any observation in respect of the warranty, the Insurance Company should have asked the clarification from the surveyor.  In fact, Insurance Company did not seek any clarification from the surveyor and therefore, by implication, accepted the report of the surveyor.  Now, Insurance Company cannot take a stand that the surveyor has not mentioned about the breach of the warranty.
11.    We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the learned counsel for the parties and examined the record. The final report filed by the police and the report of the surveyor confirmed that the diamond was given to Arjanbhai Mangukia by complainant and Arjanbhai Mangukia was murdered at his Mumbai residence.  In the present case, the surveyor has assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.55,19,316/-.  The broker or commission agents are covered under Section II of the Policy as given below:-
Section II
a) Property Insured excluding cash & currency notes whilst in the custody of the Insured, his partners, directors, employees, duly constituted attorneys :
Rs.20,00,000
b)  Property insured by the insurer excluding cash and currency notes whilst in the custody of brokers or agents or cutters or goldsmiths or stores of diamonds not in regular employment of the insured, whether directly entrusted by the insured or otherwise subject to appropriate documentary evidence being available relating to such entrustment :
Rs.1,20,00,000
Total Sum Insured (Section II)
Rs.1,40,00,000/-
12.    Clearly, the warranty clause attached to this Section requires the insured property to be kept in a safe lock of standard make if the value of the property is more than Rs.10 lacs. This warranty clause is specifically mentioned under Section II of the policy and therefore, it clearly means that this warranty is applicable for the insured property and the same was to be kept under safe lock even by the broker or commission agent.  Clearly, this warranty has not been adhered to by the complainant or his broker or commission agent and therefore, the relevant terms and conditions of the policy have been violated. It is important to note the following judgments in this regard:
(a) In General Assurance Society Ltd. Vs.Chandmull Jain, [1966 ] 3 SCR 500, it was held as under:-
17.” …In interpreting documents relating to a contract of insurance, the duty of the court is to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties, because it is not for the court to make a new contract, however reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves.”
(b) in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sony Cherian II(1999 )CPJ 13 (SC ), it has been observed as follows:-
“16. The insurance policy between the insurer and the insured represents a contract between the parties. Since the insurer undertakes to compensate the loss suffered by the insured on account of risks covered by the insurance policy, the terms of the agreement have to be strictly construed to determine the extent of liability of the insurer. The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy. That being so, the insured has also to act strictly in accordance with the statutory limitations or terms of the policy expressly set out therein.”
(c) United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal, (2004) 8 SCC 644, the Hon’ble Apex Court held as follows:-
“6. ….The terms of the policy have to be construed as it is and we cannot add or subtract something: Howsoever liberally we may construe the policy but we cannot take liberalism to the extent of substituting the words which are not intended.
9. …It is settled law that terms of the policy shall govern the contract between the parties, they have to abide by the definition given therein and all those expressions appearing in the policy should be interpreted with reference to the terms of policy and not with reference to the definition given in other laws. It is a matter of contract and in terms of the contract the relation of the parties shall abide and it is presumed that when the parties have entered into a contract of insurance with their eyes wide open, they cannot rely on definition given in other enactment.
14. Therefore, it is settled law that the terms of the contract has to be strictly read and natural meaning be given to it. No outside aid should be sought unless the meaning is ambiguous.”
13.    From the above authoritative judgments, it is clear that a consumer forum or any court for that matter, does not have power to relax the warranty clause or any terms and conditions of the policy.  From this point of view, the order of the State Commission cannot be sustained.
14.    In the complaint the complainant has mentioned its address as follows:-
“M/s. Dharmanandan Diamonds-
Partner of Partnership firm
Shri Laljibhai Tulsibhai Patel,
Aged About: 52 years, Occ-Business,
Address: N/H Patel Falia,
Gotalawadi, Katargam Road,
Surat -395004”
15.    Complainant has alleged that the complainant gave the insured property to the commission agent Arjanbhai Mangukia as is evident from the following assertion of the complainant in the complaint:-
“9.  Complainant M/s. Dharmanandan diamonds on 10/6/2002 gave the goods of polished diamonds worth Rs.78,52,388-02/- of 418.13 carats to Mr. Arjanbhai.  This Mr. Arjanbhai has many years of business experience and he was associated to many Brokers, Traders and Exporters of diamond business. He was knowing them since years.”
16.    From the above, it is indicated that the insured property was given to the commission agent Arjanbhai Mangukia as Surat.
17.    The issue of warranty has been dealt by the State Commission in the following way:-
“18.  At this juncture Shri Nanavati drawing my attention on page no.417 sec.2 has stated that if the cost of the property is more than 10 lacs then such property is required to be kept in standard safe, when in this case complainant’s commission agent who took the goods on challan has not kept in the standard safe in that circumstances as per the terms and conditions of the policy complainant is not entitled to receive the amount of Insurance.  At this juncture Shri Nanavati has vehemently argued that in this case the property is polished diamonds which were kept in the custody of commission agent Arjanbhai and when it was known that he is passed away it came to be known that he died because of hit on the back part of head as per the police investigation and receipt of goods given on challan was recovered by him.  But the polished diamonds given to him were not recovered from his body.  In that circumstances the applicant is not eligible to receive the amount of Insurance.  At this juncture, Shri. Dudhiya on behalf of the applicant has strongly argued that complainant’s commission agent namely Arjanbhai according to the customs & tradition of the business taken the polished diamonds from the applicant to show it to the customer and accordingly in this incidence also he took polished diamonds from complainant to show to customer.  In that circumstances it would not be possible to keep the diamonds in the Standard Safe and show to the customer and as per the customs and traditions with that commission agent, he has to keep the diamonds in his custody to show it to the customer.  In these circumstances complainant has not done anything wrong in giving the diamonds to his commission agent without Standard Safe.  Moreover as stated by Shri Dudhiya, commission agent cannot carry the standard safe with him in the market, and although if he carries away the standard safe with him than the people may come to know that he is carrying some valuable thing with him which may endanger his life and property.  In these circumstances the reason for repudiating the claim as stated in reason No.1 of the Repudiation Letter not reasonable and lawful & that complainants complaint cannot be rejected for that reason such argument of Shri Dudhiya deserves to be accepted.”
18.    It seems that the State Commission has agreed with the assertion of the learned counsel for the complainant that the condition of the warranty is impractical and cannot be observed as main work of the commission agent is to show the diamonds to the prospective buyers and therefore, it is not possible to keep the diamonds in the locked safe of standard make at all the time.  This argument does not seem to hold good in the present case as in the present case, the diamond seems to have been given at Surat and the commission agent  Arjanbhai Mangukia came of Mumbai and he was staying in Mumbai for the whole week and used to return to his home town at Surat on the weekend.  Moreover, the commission agent Arjanbhai Mangukia has been murdered at his residence and not at the shop of any other diamonds dealer or jeweller.  Clearly, when the diamonds are to be kept at residence, they were required to be kept under locked safe of standard make as per the warranty condition of the policy.
","19.    Based on the above discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the warranty mentioned in Section II of the policy has been breached and therefore, the insurance claim is not payable.  Accordingly, FA No.36 of 2016 M/s. The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. M/s. Dharmanandan Diamonds is allowed and the order dated 30.10.2015 of the State Commission is set aside. Consequently, the complaint is also dismissed.  In view of the dismissal of the complaint, FA No.12 of 2016 M/s. Dharmanandan Diamonds Pvt. Ltd. vs. The New India Assurance Company Ltd. also stands dismissed.

		Respondent No. 2 is already ex-parte 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant purchased a 10 KVA inverter from respondent No.2, who is a dealer of petitioner on 18.1.2008. The inverter had been manufactured by the petitioner company. A service engineer attended to the complaint of the complainant / respondent No.1 on 11.11.2009 and gave an estimate of Rs.12,000/-. The case of the complainant is that despite they having paid Rs.12,000/-, the inverter again stopped functioning after some time and the service engineer told them that the batteries had  dried up and should be replaced. Being aggrieved, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint filed on 4.9.2010.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner as well as its dealer. It was interalia stated in the reply filed by the dealer that the inverter was purchased on 18.1.2008 and had a warranty period of one year. It was further stated in the written version filed by the dealer that the first complaint in respect of the inverter was lodged by the complainant after the warranty period had already expired. It was alleged that the first complaint was lodged on 14.11.2009 and an estimate of Rs.12,000/- was given to the complainant who paid that amount whereupon the defective parts were replaced and a warranty of three months for the replaced parts was given. It was further alleged that the problem was with the battery which was manufactured by some other company and not with the inverter.
3.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. The said appeal having been dismissed, the petitioner is before this Commission.
4.      There is no credible evidence of the complainant having lodged any complaint either with the manufacturer or with the dealer before the warranty period expired on 18.1.2009. Though the complainant claims to have written a letter alleging defect in the inverter, there is no proof of the complainant having actually delivered that letter or having even dispatched it. Therefore, the service of any such letter before the expiry of the warranty period does not stand proved.
5.      The estimate given by the petitioner to the complainant for Rs.12,000/- was for replacement of some defective parts of the inverter primarily its mother board, as is evident from the report of the mechanic dated 14.11.2009 on page 82 of the paper-book and the letter sent to the complainant, available on page 85 of the paper-book.
6.      Admittedly, no technical evidence was produced by the complainant to prove any manufacturing defect in the inverter. Only the mother board was found to be defective and was replaced but it happened after the warranty period was already over. The defective parts were found for the first time on 14.11.2009. The warranty period  had already expired by that time. The petitioner was justified in charging  for the replacement of the defective part comprising mainly the PCB, which is an electronic component of the inverter and a warranty period of three months was then provided after placing the PCB. There is no evidence of the PCB having again become defective. The subsequent inspection report shows that there was problem with  the batteries which had become dry. The battery was of make AMCO as is evident from the service report available on page 84 of the paper-book. Since the warranty period had already expired by that time, the petitioner was not required to replace the batteries even if it is assumed that the batteries also were purchased from the dealer of the petitioner. In fact, if the batteries were manufactured by some other company and were found to be defective, the petitioner company will not be liable to replace these batteries and it would be only the battery manufacturer or the dealer who would be liable to replace the battery. However, in this case, there is no evidence to prove that at the time the battery was found defective, it was still in the warranty period. Therefore, no case for replacement of the inverter is made out either against the petitioner or against respondent No.2.
7.      If the batteries had become dry, it would mean that the battery water was not regularly filled in the batteries or the batteries had otherwise outlived there life. This cannot be said to be a manufacturing defect in the inverter.
8.      Admittedly, no technical expert was produced by the complainant to prove any manufacturing defect in the inverter. The parts which were found to be defective and required replacement had to be replaced after the warranty period for the inverter was over. Therefore, no case even for refund of the amount charged from the complainant for replacement of those parts, primarily the PCB of the inverter, is made out.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, since no manufacturing defect in the inverter has been proved and the defective parts required replacement only after the warranty period was over, the impugned orders cannot be sustained and the same are set aside. The consumer complaint is consequently dismissed with no order as to costs.
10.    The amount deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the interim order of this Commission, shall be refunded to the petitioner alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount. The revision petition  stands disposed of.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, MEMBER
1.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of this revision petition are that on 08.12.2010 the complainant purchased  one Honda Activa scooter  from Satnam Motors Pvt. Ltd. at Jaipur ( OP- 2) for Rs. 52,500/-, but the bill invoice mentioned the amount as Rs. 44,076/-. The OP-1 Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. is a manufacturer of the scooter. The complainant alleged that due to some manufacturing defect some liquid was leaking and the front elevation of the scooter got damaged and spoiled the colour completely. The OPs did not resolve the said problem and refused to repair them. Being aggrieved by the deficiency in service, the complainant filed a complaint against the OPs before the District Forum-II, Jaipur and prayed for refund of Rs. 52,500/- with interest alongwith other reliefs.
2.      The OP-2 filed a reply and denied the allegations. It was contended that received Rs. 44,067/- only towards  the cost of the scooter and some amount  received was towards registration charges, accessories and insurance policy totaling it to Rs. 52,500/-.  On reporting about the defect, OP-2 resolved it and the said was not a manufacturing defect. It was further submitted that the complainant had violated the warranty conditions that from 14.07.2011 plying the scooter up to 4060 km in a negligent manner. Therefore, the complainant was not entitled for any relief.
3.      The District Forum, after hearing the parties allowed the complaint with the following observation:
7. It is clear from statements of both the parties that on dated 08.12.2010 , the complainant purchased a Scooter from the defendant No.2 after making payment of total amount of Rs. 52,500/- . After a short time itself to purchasing that , defect started developing in that and on developing defects like leaking of liquid substance and different kinds of defects , it was got checked with the defendant No. 2 on dated 04.07.2011 , in which , the defendant did not dissolve any of his grievances, on which, again on dated 14.07.2011 , it was got checked with the defendant No. 2 but the complainant has clearly mentioned that the employees of the defendants did not repair his vehicle and behaved indecently with the complainant.
8. In our opinion, by doing this, the defendants have committed deficiency in service. It was the duty of the defendants that the defendants should have given the above- said vehicle of the complainant after completely repairing that and in the situation of its not getting repaired , the defendants should have given new scooter in place of above-said scooter but the defendants did not do that . Therefore, by doing this, the defendants not only have committed deficiency in service but have adopted unfair trade practice also. Therefore, the complainant is entitled to get the amount paid against above-said scooter with appropriate compensation and costs of complaint.
9. However, the complainant has made demand of total amount Rs. 52,500/- paid against the above-said scooter but as the defendants have clearly mentioned this that the amount of Rs. 44,076/- only has been received from the complainant, remaining amount Rs. 4538/- was received on account of registration charges, Rs. 850/- on account insurance and Rs. 3886/- on account of accessories of the scooter, documents of which have been produced by the defendant. therefore, the complainant is entitled to get only Rs. 44,076/- only on account of the above- said Scooter.
10. Therefore, complaint of the complainant deserves to be allowed.
ORDER
On the basis of above analysis, compliant of the complainant is allowed against the defendants and it is ordered to the defendants to pay amount of Rs. 44,076/- scooter cost to the complainant, Rs. 5,000/- on account of compensation and Rs. 2,000/- on account of costs of complaint , total Rs. 51,076/- (Rupees fifty one thousand seventy six only) to the complainant within one month from today, otherwise, the complainant will be entitled to get interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from today upto the date of recovery.
(paras 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the District Forum’s Order)
","4.     Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the OPs preferred an appeal to the State Commission. The State Commission dismissed the appeal at the admission stage with the following observation:
The complainant purchased scooter. Manufacturing defect is reported in the scooter and liquid like substance used to fall, due to which front elevation itself of the scooter got spoiled. Service of the scooter was also got done but the defect could not be cured. The complainant did not give certificate of satisfactory in the job Card but has mentioned this that please check the battery, acid falls, set the average, which has not been done.
The learned District Forum has passed Orders allowing the cost of the Scooter and compensation on account of mental agony and costs of complaint. There is no error of any kind in it. Therefore, this appeal is liable to be dismissed at the stage of admission itself, hence is dismissed.
5.     Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the OPs filed the instant revision petition.
6.     At admission stage we have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and perused the material on record. The main grievance of complainant was some leaking liquid damaged the front elevation, colour, the front tyre and dickey.
7.     We have perused the job cards dated 04.07.2011 and 14.07.2011. The OP-2 failed to rectify the colour defects and the battery leakage time and again. We note the scooter was purchased in year 2010 and now we are in year 2020.. It is evident that the OP-2 dealer did not give proper services to the complainant, the battery leakage, colour defects were neither rectified nor battery was replaced to new one as per the warranty conditions. It certainly amounts “deficiency in service” as well as “unfair trade practice” under the Act, 1986. The complainant deserves just and reasonable compensation for using such defective vehicle and for the decade long suffering of his mental agony.
8.      We find the Orders of the District Forum and the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned. The State Commission concurred with the findings of the District Forum. We note in particular the extracts of the respective observations made by the two fora, quoted in paras 4 and 5 above. Within the meaning and scope of section 21(b), we find no grave error in appreciating the evidence by the two fora below, as may necessitate re-appreciation of the evidence in revision. We find the award made by the District Forum (quoted in para 4 above), and as affirmed by the State Commission, to be just and appropriate. We find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, as may necessitate interference in the exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission.
9.      The revision petition, being misconceived and devoid of merit, is dismissed.
10.    Needless to add that the District Forum shall undertake execution as per the law.
11.    A copy each of this Order be sent to the District Forum and to the complainant by the Registry within ten days.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant allegedly approached the petitioner for construction of a residential building with a plinth area of 132.35 square metres.  He paid the entire consideration of Rs. 8,19,000/- demanded by the petitioner though according to him only 95% of the work had been done. The complainant started residing in the house but noticed several cracks and other defects in the said house. The defects  included seepage through the cracks. The cracks were specified in paragraph 3 of the consumer complaint. Some other defects in the construction are also alleged. The complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking compensation quantified at Rs. 4 lacs from the petitioner as well as from respondent No. 2, who had allegedly supervised the construction.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner as well as by R-2. It was alleged by R-2 that he being only a supervisor and having not received any consideration there was no privity of contract between him and the complainant. The petitioner, however, claimed that the complainant who is is a disciple of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had contacted the petitioner through  Sh. Hari Kumar and Sh. Chandrasekharan. The complainant requested her to provide his workers. The petitioner who is an A-class contractor and has constructed several buildings agreed to help the complainant in minimising the expenditure to be incurred on the construction. It was also alleged in the written version filed by the petitioner that only 90% of the construction work was completed and the plastering of the house was to be done but the complainant insisted that no plaster was required. It is also alleged that the petitioner had suggested the construction of one or two pillars of the west side of the house of but the complainant insisted that those pillars were not required. Thus, according to the petitioner the complainant himself was responsible for the alleged cracks in the house. As regards the construction it was alleged that the complainant had returned only Rs.3,45,000/- to the petitioner out of the expenditure incurred by him and the balance difference amount was still due from him.
3.      The District Forum directed the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 1 lacs to the complainant.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order of the District Forum both the parties approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. Vide impugned order dated 11.04.2012 the State Commission enhanced the compensation of Rs. 1.5 lacs thereby dismissing the appeal filed by the petitioner and partly allowing the appeal filed by the complainant. Being aggrieved the petitioner is before this Commission by way of these revision petitions.
5.      The first question which arises for consideration in this case is as to whether the complaint was a consumer of the petitioner or not.  The answer to this question is depend as to whether the petitioner worked gratuitously for the complainant or had constructed the house for him against consideration. The plea taken by the petitioner in his written version was that he was to instruct the complainant and he was to help her nearby contractor M/s Shilpi Constructions to minimise the expenditure to be incurred on the construction of the house.  However, no one from the Shilpi Constructions was produced by the petitioner before the District Forum. Therefore, the plea taken by the petitioner in this regard does not inspire confidence and cannot be believed. Even otherwise this is petitioner’s own case that he had spent much more than the amount received from the complainant on the construction of the house and huge amount was still due to him from the complainant. There would be no logical reason for the petitioner to incur such huge expenditure from his own pocket if he was acting gratuitously and he was only to help in containing the expenditure of complainant on the construction of the house. Had that been the position the payment would have been made directly by the complainant and not to the petitioner. Therefore, the entire story set up by the petitioner seems to be a concocted story and cannot be believed.
6.      Though the case of the petitioner is that he had received Rs.3,44,000/- from the complainant and balance amount out of the expenditure incurred by him was still payable to him the said allegation does not seem to be correct. The possession of the house was duly delivered to complainant. Had the entire sale consideration not been received by the petitioner he would not have delivered possession to the complainant or  the least he would have done was to obtain a written acknowledgement from the complainant promising to pay the balance amount within a specified time limit. That having not been done there is no escape from the conclusion that the entire consideration had been paid before delivering possession of the complete house to the complainant.
","7.      The State Commission appointed two Court Commissioners to inspect the work executed by the petitioner. One Court Commissioner assessed the cost of repairs at Rs. 2.2. lakhs whereas the other Court Commissioner assessed the cost of repairs at Rs. 2.6 lakhs.  A perusal  of the reports would show that the inspection was carried out in the presence of the parties. No request was made by the petitioner for cross examination  of the Court Commissioners in order to impeach their reports. Therefore, there is no reason for not relying upon the reports submitted by the Court Commissioners, after inspecting the spot in the presence of both the parties. The State Commission has not awarded  even the amount of Rs.2.20 lakhs to the complainant and has restricted its award to Rs 1.5 Lakh. The order passed by the State Commission, therefore, does not all for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction at the behest of the petitioner. The revision petitions are, therefore, dismissed, with no order as to costs.

Challenge in this Revision Petition u/s 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short, “the Act”), by the Complainants, is to the Order dated 16.03.2017 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi  (for short “the State Commission”) in First Appeal No.154 of 2013 and First Appeal No.202 of 2013. By the impugned Order, the State Commission has dismissed both the Cross Appeals filed by the Complainants as well as the Opposite Parties Nos.1 & 3 against the Order dated 31.01.2013, passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum VII, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi (for short, “the District Forum”). By the said Order, the District Forum, while allowing the Complaint preferred by the Complainants, has directed the Opposite Party Nos.1 and 3, jointly and severally, to deliver the duly repaired car to the Complainants on payment of balance agreed amounts of ₹1,50,000/- and ₹1,00,000/- by the Complainants; pay ₹50,000/- as compensation for mental agony and harassment and also to pay ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation, within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of a copy of the Order.
2.      The facts giving rise to the present Revision Petition, as culled out from the Complaint, are that: the Petitioners/Complainants, members of an Undivided Hindu Family, purchased a Honda City Car manufactured by Honda Siels Cars India, Opposite Party No.2, in the year 1999. Unfortunately, on 26.09.2010, the said car collided with a divider near Dabri Bus Stand, New Delhi and suffered damages. On 28.09.2010, the car was taken to the Authorized Service Centre, namely, M/s. Samara Auto Max Honda Pvt. Ltd., Opposite Party No.3 (for short, “the Service Centre”) where the Surveyor and Loss Assessor appointed by the New India Assurance Company examined the car and estimated the costs of repairs at ₹1,31,318.30/-. Since the car was insured for a sum of ₹91,800/- only, he recommended reimbursement of the amount of ₹55,373.95/-. However, the Service Centre of the Honda Car estimated the costs of repairs approximately at ₹1,50,000/-. As the car had run only 37,682 kms. from the date of its purchase, the Complainants agreed to get it repaired and paid a sum of ₹50,000/- as advance to the Service Centre. The expected date of delivery of car after repairs was given to the Complainants as 30.10.2010. However, on the said date, when the Complainants enquired over telephone about the delivery of car, they were informed to contact after three/four days as some of the parts of the car were not available.
3.      The Complainants visited the Service Center on 18.11.2010 and found that the car was still not repaired and it was lying dismantled. They were informed that the cost of repairs had been increased to ₹1.8 lakhs. The Complainants were compelled either to give their consent for repair of the car or to take away the car after paying the expenses of dismantling and reassembling the parts etc.. Left with no option, Complainants granted their consent for repair of the Car, however, the Car was not repaired by the Service Centre till 24.11.2010 when the Complainants were informed that the costs of repair had further increased to ₹2.4 lakhs as some more defects had been noticed in the Car. The Complainants strongly objected the said increase in the repair costs in arbitrary manner. However, ultimately, conceded their consent with heavy head and heart. Even still, the car was not repaired. Being fed up with the delaying tactics of the Service Centre, the Complainants sent a legal notice by registered post to the General Manger, Service Centre as well as the Manufacturer on 07.03.2011 and reminder on 08.04.2011. Vide letter dated 15.03.2011, the Service Centre, informed the Complainants that the vehicle had been duly repaired and the delivery can be taken by payment of ₹2,71,489/-. On receipt of response on 19.04.2011, the Complainant wrote a letter to the Service Centre demanding the retail invoice.
4.      On 13.05.2011, the Complainants went to the Service Centre for taking the delivery of the repaired car along with an automobile expert. During the trial run, Complainants found many defects and deficiencies in the car which were informed to the Opposite Parties Nos.1 & 2 vide letter dated 16.05.2011. In the said letter, it was alleged that the good condition Steering Rack Colum, silencer and tail lights were replaced with defective ones. Since all their persuasive efforts to get repaired the car to their entire satisfaction went fruitless, the Complainants, alleging deficiency in service on the part of Opposite Parties filed the Complaint before the District Forum seeking directions to them to deliver the duly repaired car in excellent condition; install the original parts of the car which were replaced with defective parts; pay jointly or severally a compensation of ₹5,00,000/- for hiring the private taxies due to delay in delivery of car; pay ₹12,00,000/- towards damages for mental agony, harassment and torture suffered by them and to pay ₹20,000/- towards costs of litigation.
5.      Upon notice, the Complaint was contested by the Opposite Parties. In their joint reply, the Opposite Parties Nos.1 & 3, inter-alia, pleaded that; (i) sanction for an expenditure of ₹1.8 lakh on 18.11.2010 and ₹2.40 lakhs on 24.11.2010 on repair of the car was given by the husband of the Complainant No.1 out of his free will and without any coercion; (ii) there was no delay on their part to repair the car and the job work was done within three months from the date of final sanction of the expenses; (iii) as per Clause 7 of the terms & conditions of the repair order, the Complainants were at liberty to take back the car by paying only 5% of the estimate of the repair of the car, if they were not satisfied with the estimate after dismantling of the car; however, the said option was not exercised by the Complainants; (iv) Complainants have failed to produce any evidence to show that the car was purchased in the name of Sudesh Berry in the year 1999 and it had collided with a divider of the road; (v) the estimates given to the Complainants were purely temporary in nature and were liable to be enhanced subject to the conditions of the spare parts found on dismantling of the damaged car; (vi) the Complainants were telephonically requested to take the delivery of the car on 12.02.2011, 18.02.2011 and 28.02.2011 on payment of the repair charges but they did not come forward; and (vii) no defect was found during trial run of the car.
6.      Besides raising a preliminary issue about the maintainability of the Complaint on the ground that the Complainants were not the “Consumers” as defined in the Act because there was no transaction of buying goods for a valid consideration or deficiency in service on their part, the Opposite Party No.2, in its reply, pleaded on merits that the main case of the Complainants was against Opposite Parties Nos.1 & 3 for non-delivery of the vehicle after repairs and no such allegation had been made against them; the car was ready for delivery after repairs but the Complainants deliberately did not take the delivery of the same; there was no privity of contract between the Opposite Party No.2 and the Complainants entitling them to claim any compensation against them; the relationship between the Opposite Parties Nos.1 and 2 was on principal to principal basis and each party was responsible for its own action and  as there was no allegation of any manufacturing defect in the car, they had been wrongly impleaded in the Complaint.
7.      On appraisal of the material available on record and the evidence adduced before it, the District Forum came to the conclusion that it was a clear case of unfair trade practice as the Opposite Parties Nos.1 & 3 not only exploited the hapless Complainants to agree to the enhanced repair charges but also failed to deliver the vehicle admittedly till 27.02.2011 and accordingly directed them to, jointly or severely, deliver the duly repaired car to the Complainants on payment of balance of the initially agreed amount of ₹1,50,000/- i.e. ₹1,00,000/-; to pay ₹50,000/- towards compensation for mental agony and harassment and ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation. Opposite Party No.2, the Manufacturer, was absolved from any liability.
8.      Aggrieved, both the Complainants and the Opposite Parties Nos.1 and 3 filed Cross Appeals before the State Commission. However, the State Commission dismissed both the Appeals observing thus:-
“The conduct of Opposite Party No.1 & 3 is not fair. It is clear case of unfair trade practice on the part of Opposite Party Nos.1 & 3 who not only exploited the helpless Complainants to agree to the enhanced repair charges on the ground that the damaged vehicle is in the custody of the Opposite Party Nos. 1 & 3 and the Complainant cannot take the vehicle in such condition. These are the circumstances, due to which Opposite Party No.1 & 3 took advantage by increasing the amount of the repair, which is not only the deficiency in service but a clear case of unfair trade practice. The affidavits which have been filed by both the parties show that from time to time the enhancement in the cost of repairs have been made by Opposite Party No.1 & 3.
The District Forum has very rightly decided that Opposite Party No. 1 & 3 are guilty of indulging in unfair trade practice for enhancing the charges of repair from ₹1,50,000/- to ₹2,40,000/-.  The District Forum has rightly directed the Complainants to pay ₹1,00,000/- to the Opposite Party Nos. 1 & 3 who will thereafter deliver the vehicle in good condition.  As far as grant of compensation of ₹50,000/- for mental agony and harassment is concerned, the same has been awarded by the Ld. District Forum after considering the documents on record by the Ld. District Forum.  The same is not on lower side as is contended by Complainants. Further, grant of compensation is discretion of Ld. District Forum.  The same has been exercised by the Ld. District Forum after considering all the relevant material on record.  “We find no reason to interfere with the same.”
9.      The present Revision Petition has been filed by the Complainants for enhancement of the compensation.
10.    We have heard Mr. K. P. Berry, Petitioner No.2, who had appeared in person on behalf of the Petitioners and the Learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents. Mr. Berry submitted that M/s. Samara Automax Honda Pvt. Ltd., Authorised Service Centre of Honda Siels Cars India Ltd., acted illegally and arbitrarily in not repairing the car and handing over the same at an early date as the car was taken to the Authorised Service Centre, Respondent No.3, on 28.09.2010 which has caused great pecuniary loss and mental agony and harassment to the Petitioners.
11.    The Learned Counsel for the Respondents Nos.1 & 2 submitted that the Honda Siels Cars India cannot be made liable to pay any amount whatsoever to the Petitioners for the simple reason that no manufacturing defect has been found in the car. The Learned Counsel for the Respondent No.3, however, submitted that the Petitioner is liable to pay the repairing charges as assessed by the engineers in the Service Centre, which were not paid and, therefore, the Respondent No.3 cannot be made liable to pay anything.
12.    The material on record shows that the car met with an accident on 26.09.2010 when it collided with the divider and was damaged. It was taken to the Authorised Service Centre of Respondent No.3 on 28.09.2010. For one reason or the other, the car has not been repaired and every time when the Petitioner No.2 went to the Authorised Service Centre of Respondent No.3, one or the other reasons were given in escalating the cost of repair which, in our considered opinion, was not at all justified. The Petitioner is entitled for the car in question fully repaired and in running condition which he had been deprived of for the illegal and arbitrary action of the Respondent No.3 for such a long time. The car Honda City is of the year 1999. About 20 years have passed. Now, the Petitioner cannot use such an old model car. More so, the Transport Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi vide its Public Notice dated 30.10.2018 have put a restriction on plying the Petrol and Diesel Vehicles, which are more than 15 years and 10 years old respectively, on the roads in NCR. For the sake of convenience, the Public Notice dated 30.10.2018 issued by the Transport Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi is reproduced as hereunder:

The present revision petition no.2731 of 2016 has been filed by M/s Cannaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd., against the judgment dated15.06.2016 of the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (‘the State Commission’) in First Appeal no. 352 of 2012.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that on 01.09.2005, the complainant/ respondent has participated in the opposite party/ petitioner’s widely published scheme ‘Mc Donald’s Mein Khao Har Bar Prize Le Jao’ by placing two separate orders worth Rs.81/-.
On opening the coupon the complainant found the following text:
“Congratulations LUCKY! to get luck (i) open the slot below 20 get the sure shot prize (iii) SMS the sab lucky code to win the exciting prizes! Sure shot prize *Fries – Small French Fries Limit one offer one coupon. Congratulations! Exchange this coupon for free *French Fries on your next purchase of above Rs.20/- at Mc D (before 30th September 2005). You stand to win Panasonic Mobile Phones every hour, ipods every day and a Chervolet Optra as Bumper prize. Retain this coupon to claim your prize SL 3418668. SMS the code to 8888 and you stand to win Sab Lucky Bumper Jackpot, daily and hourly prizes. 2005 Mc Donald’s Corporation. * Fries – Small Frenchh Fries Limit one offer per coupon. Terms and conditions apply. Refer to restaurant’s notice board for details”.
3.     It was alleged by the complainant that he did not find any terms and conditions on the notice board of the OP, instead he found leaflet of another scheme ‘McDonald’s Ghar Bulao Sab Lucky Ban Jao!’
4.     On OPs Manager’s advice, the complainant has sent two SMS on 8888 giving the coupon nos., for which Rs.3/- per SMS were charged;
5.     It was alleged by the complainant that OP has indulged into unfair trade practices by not giving the assured prizes as per the scheme, rather put the participants under the obligation to make further purchase of minimum Rs.20/- in order to avail free French Fries;
6.     Moreover, the details of the entire scheme with its terms and conditions and the result of the winners were also concealed from the participating customers, therefore, the complainant has filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum praying to declare the scheme as unfair trade practice and OP be directed to disclose the entire scheme, winners of the prizes. It was also prayed to refund the amount collected in lieu of premium SMS charges levied as well as refund of Rs.81/- and Rs.6/- for SMS with cost and compensation.
7.     The complaint was resisted  by the OPs stating the following:
The scheme and prizes offered are subjected to the terms and conditions which were displayed on the notice board at each outlet of the McDonalds;
Almost 30 customers were declared winners for iPods, bumper jackpot prize of Chervolet was won by Ms Rekha Bisht;
Moreover, the said result was also displayed on the notice board of the OPs;
Result was to be declared by the indiatimes.com on hourly and daily basis by randomly choosing the winner through a lucky draw generated by the server, OPs had no role to play in it.
8.     The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (North), Tis Hazari, Delhi (‘the District Forum’) vide its order dated 08.02.2012 has allowed the complaint and awarded Rs.10,000/- as compensation and Rs.2000/- as cost to the complainant.
","9.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner M/s Cannaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd., filed an appeal before the State Commission. The State Commission vide its impugned order dated 15.06.2016 disposed of the appeal of the OP and modified the order of the District Forum by enhancing the compensation to Rs.2.00 lakh and Rs.10.00 lakh as punitive damages to be deposited with the Consumer Welfare Fund. Order to be complied within sixty days failing which awarded amount would carry interest @ 9% p a.
10.   Hence, the present revision petition.
11.   Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the respondent who appeared in person.
12.   Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that no deficiency of service has been alleged against the opposite party and the only allegation made by the complainant against the OP was charging of special rate for SMS which was more than the normal SMS charge. As the number of consumers were many, therefore, the OP earned huge profit and therefore, this is an unfair trade practice. Learned counsel argued that SMS charges were not being collected by the opposite party, rather, charges were going to the mobile company/ service provider. The complainant has not shown any proof that there was any agreement between the Telecom company/ service provider and the opposite party on sharing of the charges. Thus, it was a fair scheme for promoting sale of products of the opposite party and it cannot be called an unfair trade practice. So far as the allegation of non-disclosure of actual winners is concerned, the OP had already provided this information before the District Forum and the State Commission. It is not the duty of the opposite party to satisfy each and every consumer who seeks this information. The State Commission has not given any reason as to how the scheme was an unfair trade practice. There is no specific clause under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 mentioned in the State Commission’s order under which it can be covered. The State Commission has imagined 4.00 lakh SMS @ Rs.3/- per SMS and accordingly ordered Rs.2.00 lakh to be paid to the complainant and Rs.10.00 lakh to be deposited with the Consumer Welfare Fund. As the SMS charges were never given to the opposite party, there should have been no question of ordering of payment of Rs.12.00 lakh in this way. Moreover, the petitioner was not aggrieved by the order of the District Forum as no appeal was filed by the complainant before the State Commission. Hence, there should not have been any question of enhancing the compensation by the State Commission as no appeal was filed by the complainant before the State Commission for enhancement of compensation. Thus, the order of the State Commission is without jurisdiction as well as totally illegal. The learned counsel requested to set aside the impugned order.
13.   On the other hand, the respondent who is appearing in person states that though there is no proof that there was some sharing of profit on the SMS charges being collected by the mobile company/ service provider, it is but natural that the OP was conducting this scheme not only to promote the sale of their products but to get money from the SMS. The scheme was totally shrouded with the mystery as results were not widely published. Both the fora below have found deficiency on the part of the OP, though the amount of compensation ordered is different. The scope under the revision petition is quite limited and the facts cannot be re-assessed by this Commission against concurrent findings. The fact is that the scheme run by the OP was an unfair trade practice.
14.   I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as by the respondent and have carefully examined material on record. It is true that the scheme run by the OP was a scheme to promote the sale of products of the OP by giving various offers to the consumers of the OP. The facts relating to the scheme have been examined by the fora below and this Commission would not like to re-examine the facts in the light of the following observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286,”:
“17.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
15.   The main issue in the present case is in respect of SMS charges. No proof has been filed by the complainant that the OP has collected the SMS charges or the OP have agreement with the Telecom Company/ Service provider on sharing of SMS  charges. It is understood that commercial rate was being charged for SMS under this scheme. It can only be presumed that the party (OP in this case) facilitating income of the Telecom Company/ service provider by encouraging the customers of Telecom company/ service provider to make use of the services of commercial SMS, will definitely get some benefits out of the increased earnings of the Telecom company/ service provider. However, the decision in this regard is without any proof of the same. Thus, the order of the State Commission awarding Rs.2.00 lakh to the complainant and ordering to deposit Rs.10.00 lakh with the Consumer Welfare Fund cannot be sustained. On the other hand, it is also true that the scheme was unfair trade practice followed by the OP as established under the concurrent findings given by the fora below and the complainant and other similar customers who may not have come forward to file a complaint need the relief.
16.   In this view of the matter, I deem it appropriate to allow compensation of Rs.30,000/- to be paid to the complainant and an amount of Rs.70,000/- to be deposited with the Consumer Welfare Fund maintained by the State Commission.
17.   Based on the above discussion, the revision petition is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission dated 15.06.2016 is modified to the extent that the amount of compensation to be paid to the complainant will be Rs.30,000/- instead of Rs.2.00 lakh and the amount to be deposited with the Consumer Welfare Fund will be Rs.70,000/- instead of Rs.10 lakh as ordered by the State Commission. With this modification, the order of the State Commission dated 15.06.2016 is upheld. The order be complied by the opposite party within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

2.      The possession of the allotted flats having not been delivered to them by the date stipulated in the agreements in this regard, the complainants/appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking possession of the allotted flats with compensation.
3.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent primarily on the following grounds:
(i) The State Commission did not have the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the Consumer Complaint.
(ii) The bed rocks were encountered while carrying out excavation though it had not shown up during initial soil testing, which necessitated blasting of the rocks and license for carrying out the blasting work had to be obtained, which resulted in delay.
(iii) There was delay in obtaining the Commencement Certificate from BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike).
(iv) There was short supply of construction material.
(v) There was strike by construction material suppliers.
(vi) There was shortage of labour.
4.      It was also stated in the written version that the respondent was ready and willing to deliver possession of the allotted flats to the complainants.
5.      The possession of the allotted flats was delivered to the complainants/appellants during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints before the State Commission and the sale deeds in their favour were also executed. The State Commission was of the opinion that considering the ground given by the respondent for the delay in completion of the construction, it was entitled to an extension of six months.  For the subsequent delay, the State Commission awarded compensation @ Rs.10,000/- per month, in each complaint.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission on the quantum of compensation, the appellants/complainants are before this Commission.
6.      It is also submitted on behalf of the respondent that they have provided free modular kitchen to the complainants in order to compensate them for the delay in completion of the construction.  The offer to provide free modular kitchen was made to the complainants during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints and was accepted by the complainants/appellants.
7.      Thus, the only question involved in these appeals is as to whether the complainants/appellants have been adequately compensated for the delay in delivery of possession of the allotted flats to them or not.
8.      The learned counsel for the parties have drawn my attention to clause 8.1 and 8.2 of the agreements which read as under:
8.1    The First Party, based on its present plans and estimates and subject to all just exceptions, contemplates to complete the construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment and agrees to complete construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment on or before 30th November, 2011 with a grace time of an additional 3 (three) months in case of delay without having to pay to the Second Party and interest or damages.  The First Party shall handover possession of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment to the Second Party only after the same is ready of occupation and subject to payment of all the amounts due under this Agreement.  In the event of delay in handover beyond the time period as above the First Party shall pay to the Second Party interest at the rate of 10% (ten percent) per annum, pro-rated for further periods of such delays.  The interest shall be calculated on all amounts received by the First Party from the Second Party, excluding the taxes and deposits.  Such penalty shall be applicable only if the Second Party has made all payments to First Party as per the payment schedule agreed to at the time of booking and as attached hereto.
8.2    Though every effort will be made to obtain electrical, water and sanitary connections within the stipulated time, no responsibility will be accepted by the Second Party for delays in obtaining such connections, clearances, certificates from the statutory authorities and the Second Party shall not be entitled to claim any damage/losses against the First Party on the ground of such delay.  The First Party shall not be liable if they are unable to complete the construction of the Schedule ‘C’ Apartment and deliver possession by the aforesaid date by reason of non-availability of cement, steel and other construction materials, civil commotion or by any act of God or if the delay is caused as a result of any Rule, Notification of the Government, Municipal Authority, any Court and/or any other public or competent Authority prohibiting construction activities or for reason beyond the control of the First Party and in any of the aforesaid events, the First Party shall be entitled to reasonable extension of time for delivery and possession of the completed premises and the monies till then paid by the Second Party under this agreement shall not be refunded.
9.      It would thus be seen that the possession of the apartments was to be delivered on or before the date stipulated in clause 8.1 of agreements that a grace period of three months was also available to the respondent.  In the event of delay, the respondent was required to pay interest @ 10% per annum for the period of delay.
10.    Clause 8.2 of the agreements gives benefit to the respondent in respect of the delay in obtaining the electrical, water and sanitary connections, clearances and certificates from the statutory authorities.  The use of the expression ‘delays’ in clause 8.2 of the agreements would mean that in order to claim benefit of the said clause, the respondent was required to prove that the grant of the requisite sanctions, clearance etc. had taken more than the time usually taken for such clearances and certificates and the said delay occurred without there being any fault on the part of the respondent.  Since no one can be allowed to take advantage of his own lapse, respondent would not be entitled to any benefit of clause 8.2 of the agreement if the delay in grant of the requisite clearances and certificates, is attributable to it.
The respondent did not specify, in the written version filed by it as to when it had applied for obtaining the electrical, water and sanitary connections, how much time was taken by the concerned authorities in granting such connections and how much was the time usually taken by the concerned authorities in grant of such connections.  The correspondence exchanged between the respondent and the concerned authorities in this regard was not placed before the State Commission.  Therefore, it can hardly be disputed that the respondent had failed to establish, before the State Commission that there was delay in grant of electrical, water and sanitary connections and the said delay had occurred without there being any lapse/defect or shortcoming on the part of the respondent in seeking such connections.
11.    Under clause 8.2 of the agreement, the respondent was not to be liable in case of delay in completion of construction due to non-availability of cement, steel and other construction material.  However, no evidence was led before the State Commission to prove that cement, steel or any other construction material was not actually available in the market during the relevant period, despite efforts made by the respondent to procure such construction material.  No evidence of any civil commotion or any act of God having actually delayed the construction was produced by the respondent.  There is no evidence of any rule, notification etc. of an authority having prohibited construction activity.  Therefore, the benefit of clause 8.2 of the agreement, in my opinion, was not available to respondent.
12.    As regards the bed rock alleged to have been encountered by the respondent at foundation level, neither the initial soil testing report was filed before the State Commission to prove that the bed rocks had not shown up in the initial soil testing report nor did the respondent place any document on record to prove the time actually taken in obtaining the license required for carrying out the blasting work.  Therefore, it would be difficult to justify the delay on account of the bed rocks alleged to have been encountered during the course of excavation.  In any case, the agreement does give an extension of three months to the respondent for delay on account of any unforeseen circumstsances.
13.    Though it is alleged that there was delay on the part of the BBMP in granting the commencement certificate, no evidence has been led to prove the said delay.  No documents were filed before the State Commission to prove the date on which the commencement certificate was sought and the date on which the said commencement certificate was actually issued.  No evidence was led to prove how much time is usually taken by BBMP in grant of such commencement certificate.  The correspondence exchanged between the respondent and BBMP in this regard has not been placed on the record of the State Commission to substantiate the alleged delay in grant of the commencement certificate.  Therefore, the aforesaid ground, in my opinion, did not stand established before the State Commission.
14.    There is no evidence of strike by construction material suppliers.  It is otherwise difficult to accept that the supply of the construction material in the area remained wholly suspended on account of the alleged strike of the construction material suppliers.  Moreover, the dates of the alleged strike by the construction material suppliers were not given in the written version filed before the State Commission.
15.    Though the respondent alleged shortage of labour, no evidence was led to prove that the labour was not actually available in the market despite the efforts made by the respondent or the contractors engaged by it for carrying out the construction work.
16.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I have no hesitation in holding that the respondent failed to justify the delay in delivery of possession to the complainants/appellants.   Therefore, they are entitled to the agreed compensation after getting benefit of the grace period of three months envisaged in clause 8.1 of the agreement to the respondent.
17.    As per clause 8.1 of the agreement, the respondent was required to pay interest @ 10% per annum to the complainants for the period the construction was delayed.  There is no reason why the complainants should be denied even the compensation which the developer had agreed to pay to them at the time the agreements were executed with them.  This is more so when clause 4.1 of the agreements required payment of interest @ 18% per annum in the event of delay on the part of the complainants in making payment to the respondent.
18.    Admittedly, modular kitchen was provided by the respondent to the complainant during the pendency of the Consumer Complaints in order to compensate them for the delay in completion of the construction.  There is no evidence of the modular kitchen being a part of the agreement executed between the parties.  Therefore, the difference between the cost of modular kitchen and a regular kitchen, as per the agreement executed between the parties, has to be adjusted out of the compensation to which the complainants/appellants are entitled in terms of their agreements with the respondent.
","19.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the Appeals and the Consumer Complaints are disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      The respondent shall convey to the complainants/appellants, within four weeks from today, the difference between the cost of the modular kitchen as provided by it to the complainants/appellants and the cost of the regular kitchen which the respondent had to provide to the complainants/appellants as per the agreements executed with them.    The communication which the respondent will send to the complainants/appellants in this regard, will be accompanied by reports of an Architect and a Chartered Accountant of the respondents, both of whom will also certify the difference in the cost of the modular kitchen and the regular kitchen, to be calculated in terms of this order.  The relevant date for the purpose of calculating the difference in the cost would be the date on which the possession of the apartment was offered to the complainants/appellants.  The adjustment between the cost of the modular kitchen and normal kitchen, calculated in terms of this order, would be applicable only in case of those complainants/appellants who have been provided with the facility of a modular kitchen in their apartments.
(ii)      The respondent shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% per annum w.e.f. three months from the last date stipulated in the agreement for delivery of possession in clause 8.1 of the agreements till the date on which the possession was offered to the complainants.  The difference between the cost of the modular kitchen and the regular kitchen, as calculated in terms of this order, shall be adjusted while computing the compensation in the form of simple interest payable to the complainants/appellants in terms of this order.
(iii)     If any payment has been made to the complainants towards compensation, that shall also be adjusted from the interest payable to them in terms of this order.
(iv)    The compensation by way of interest shall be payable on the entire amount which the complainants/appellants had paid to the respondent on or before the last date stipulated in clause 8.1 of the agreement for delivery of possession.
(v)     The complainants/appellants shall also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- as the cost of litigation in each complaint.
(vi)    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today.

","Anup K. Thakur
Vide this Revision Petition No.1023 of 2016, the petitioner/complainant- Rajiv Bal (complainant hereafter) has challenged the impugned order of the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (State Commission, for short) dated 19.01.2016,  the operative portion whereof, reads as below:
“In view of above discussions, application for additional evidence is allowed. The case is remand back to the District Forum for considering the same afresh after allowing the OP1 to lead additional evidence on principles analogical to order 41 rule 23A CPC. It was held in (1987) I Orissa LR 442 that when no prayer is made under order 42 rule 27 CPC to consider additional evidence, the court would not exercise its power of remand back under Order 41 rule 23A moved and allowed, the court can exercise its power of remand under Order 41 rule 23A. This is what is being exactly done in the present case. Further it was held in AIR 2003 SC 3167 that when court has not dealt and not rendered any decision on the question of subsequent grant in favour of plaintiff/purchaser from Inamdar, issue of the fact and identity of land under the two grants is vital to the just decision of the case and therefore appeal court is empowered to remand whole suit for retrial. As abundant precautions it may be mentioned that in case the OP1 moves an application for amendment of Written Statement it will open to the District Forum to consider the same on the merits. Parties are directed to appear before District Forum on 15.02.2016.”
In challenge thereto, the petitioner has made the following prayer before the National Commission:
“(a) Set aside the order dated January 19, 2016, passed by State Commission;
(b)Uphold order dated July 14, 2011 passed by District Forum-VII, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi in Complaint Case No. 349/09 titled as “Mr. Rajiv Bal V/s Harrison Industries and Others”;
(c) Grant interest @18% per annum to the Petitioner on the amount awarded in favour of the Petitioner by the District Forum in terms of Order dated July 14, 2011, from the date of making the payment to the respondents till its realization;
(d) Call for the records of the Appeal i.e. First Appeal No. 424 of 2011 titled as “Harrison Industries and Another V/s Rajiv Bal and Others” decided by the State Commission by an Order dated January 19, 2016 and records of complaint case No. 349/09 titled as “Mr. Rajiv Bal Versus Harrison Industries and Others” pending adjudication before District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-VII, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi and is next listed on April 11, 2016;
(e) Grant Costs of the Petition; and
(f) pass such further order/orders as this Hon’ble Commission may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.”
3.  Learned counsels for the parties were heard at some length on 23.10.2019. Each made out an elaborate case on behalf of their parties and argued as if the entire consumer complaint was to be decided by the Commission after hearing arguments on this RP. This was clearly not so as the RP, notwithstanding the elaborate   prayer for relief made in it, is really quite limited in it’s scope. This RP basically challenges the impugned order of the State Commission which, finding merit in an application of respondent 1 & 2 herein/ appellant 1 & 2/ OP1 & 2 (hereafter OP 1 & 2) for permission to file additional evidence, had allowed the same, after hearing the parties, and remanded the matter to the District Forum, and directed the parties to appear before it on 15.02.2016. Instead of appearing before the District Forum on 15.02.2016, the complainant has chosen to file this RP, challenging  the aforementioned order of the State Commission.
4. The only issue  to be decided in this RP therefore is whether or not to permit OP 1 & 2 to file the additional evidence.
5. After hearing extensive arguments on behalf of the parties, I am of the considered view that the impugned order suffers from no infirmity.
6.  In the normal course, filing of additional evidence at the appellate stage would not be permissible. However, this technicality can be set aside by a court if it is persuaded that it is necessary in the interest of natural justice and if it comes to the view that not allowing such evidence may hinder the dispensation of substantive justice. After all, courts are  for adjudication aimed at delivering substantive justice for which procedures have been laid down. However, should the process and procedures stand in the way of substantive justice, court would be obliged to take remedial steps. This is precisely what the learned State Commission has done.
7. In the case at hand, the impugned order is detailed in it’s reasoning based on sound legal principles. The State Commission has noted the relevant period viz. 1999-2001, the period when ‘Novacrylic Surface’ was installed by OP 1 & 2 on the tennis court in the complainant’s farm house and the farm house was also used for shooting of a film,  “Monsoon Wedding”, which was released in 2001. This fact had not been brought before the consumer forum. The State Commission then noted that OP 1 & 2 have submitted that they were not aware of this and came to learn about it only in the first week of Oct. 2013 when they watched the movie and could see that it had been shot at the complainant’s farm house. This may have been a significant factor having a bearing on the case and the OPs felt it was important enough to bring it on record. So, they sought permission to do so. Clearly, OPs could not have brought this up before the District Forum because they were not aware of it at the time; they could have brought it up only when they themselves became aware of it. So there was no question that this additional evidence had not been filed before for the very good reason that the OPs were not aware of it. Since this evidence needed to be also taken into consideration, the State Commission allowed the application and remanded the matter to the District Forum. Complainant had a choice : he could have accepted the order and appeared before the District Forum or he could have come in revision (appeal) against what is clearly an interim order in the entire proceedings. He chose the latter course. I find no reason to sustain this Revision Petition as I find no infirmity at all in the impugned order.
","8. In view of the discussion above, this revision petition is dismissed. Parties are now directed to appear before the District Forum as per the State Commission’s order on 18.09.2020.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. DINESH SINGH,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Sukhandeep Singh, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.     Heard learned counsel for the Petitioner. Perused the material on record.
It is therefore remains unclear as to from where the Complainant derives the ‘locus’ to agitate the case.
10.   The District Forum’s Order of 11.06.2019 suffers from a fundamental infirmity, in that it did not examine or return reasoned findings on the ‘locus’ of the Complainant to file the Complaint.
11.   That being as it is, it may be first recapitulated that the Act is for “better protection of the interests of consumers”, to provide “speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes”.
Section 3 specifically provides that the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. That is, the remedy provided under the Act is in addition to the provisions of any other law for the time being in force; the provisions of the Act give the consumers an additional remedy besides those that may be available under other existing laws.
Section 2 (1) (d) (i) & (ii) specifically stipulates “but does not include a person who obtain such goods for resale or for any commercial purposes” and “but does not include a person who avails of such services for any commercial purposes”.
The Explanation to section 2 (1) (d) stipulates that “ “commercial purpose” does not include use by a person of goods bought and used by him and services availed by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment.”
12.   Admittedly, the Complainant was running a Marriage Palace / Resort over an area of land admeasuring about 2.15 acres.
A No Objection Certificate dated 26.05.2006 from the concerned Sub Divisional Magistrate, placed on record with the Petition, inter alia states that “Dreamland Farm House / Resort - - - is given permission to conduct Ceremonies / Function of marriages, Birthdays, Bhogs etc. - - - ”.
13.   In the given facts and specificities of the case, mere averment, in the language of the Explanation to section 2 (1) (d), is no ground for holding the Complainant, who admittedly runs a Marriage Palace / Resort, over an area of land admeasuring about 2.15 acres, has No Objection from the Sub Divisional Magistrate to conduct marriages, birthdays, bhogs, etc. in the “Farm House / Resort”, did not himself pay the processing fee to the Opposite Parties, as ‘consumer’ under the Act.
14.   In the facts and specificities of the case, the averment, so made, was required to be examined on facts and evidence, and cogent reasoned findings recorded, which is not discernible in the District Forum’s Order.
15.   The Explanation to section 2 (1) (d) is clear. “exclusively for earning his livelihood by means of self-employment” has to be read with the due understanding and significance of “exclusively” and “earning his livelihood”  and “by means of self-employment”.
Reasonable and logical interpretation has to be kept limited and confined to reason and logic, not hypothised towards anyhow allowing anyone in (as is evident in this case).
16.   It is well evinced that the District Forum has erred in holding the Complainant to be a ‘consumer’ within the definition of section 2 (1) (d) of the Act.
17.   Seeing that the District Forum erred ab initio in deciding the preliminary issue, erroneously held the Complainant to be a ‘consumer’, the Complaint fails here itself, on maintainability.
There is no need felt to go further and examine or critique the State Commission’s impugned Order.
The Complainant could not have, and can not, enter into the Consumer Protection Forum, not being a ‘consumer’ under the Act.
","18.   Sequel to the above discussion, the Complaint is dismissed.
19.   Here it may also be added that Section 2 (1) (d) (definition of ‘consumer’) and section 3 (additional remedy to consumers) of the Act 1986 have to be understood in conjunction and perspective. Denial to avail the additional remedy in Consumer Protection Fora to a person who is not a ‘consumer’ does not take away or affect his right to agitate his case in an appropriate forum / court as per the law. (Conversely, the availability of additional remedy in Consumer Protection Fora does not take away the option of a ‘consumer’ to agitate his case in any other appropriate forum / court.)
20.   This Commission has not gone into the merits of the dispute between the two sides.
The right of the Complainant to agitate his case as per the law before an appropriate forum / civil court remains unaffected. The Complainant is, thus, free to agitate his case in an appropriate forum / court as per the law. If he chooses to bring action in a civil court, the Complainant is free to file appropriate application under Sections 5 and 14 of the Limitation Act of 1963, and, in such contingency, the chronological proceedings in the Consumer Protection Fora would be material and relevant towards making such application.
21.   It goes without saying that the dismissal of the Complaint on maintainability does not in any way absolve the Opposite Parties No. 1 and No. 2 from duly discharging their statutory / official duties as per the law, and ‘accountability’ per se remains unaffected.
24.    ‘Dasti’, in addition.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
This Order shall dispose of seven revision petitions arising against the common impugned Order of the State Commission Punjab passed on 18.12.2017 in the appeals filed by the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (now BDA), Bathinda ( hereinafter referred as ‘PUDA’- ‘OP’).
Brief facts of the case are that the complainant had applied for a plot in the scheme launched by the PUDA for free hold residential plots in PUDA Enclave at Budhlada. The complainants initially deposited the earnest money and subsequently 15% of the total value of the plot was paid after being successful in the draw of lots and after receiving the letter of intent. The possession was to be handed over after the completion of development work at the site or within 18 months from the date of issuance of allotment letter, whichever was earlier. PUDA issued a letter of intent dated 26.02.2013 to the each complainant. The OP neither developed any plot nor delivered the possession to the complainants. Being aggrieved the seven complainants filed separate complaints before the District Forum, Mansa.
3.      The District Forum after considering the pleadings and evidence  allowed the complaint and directed to refund the amount received by the OP from the complainant alongwith interest @ 9% per annum from the date of receipt till the date of payment, and also directed to pay Rs. 7,000/- as compensation and another Rs. 3,000/- as litigation expenses.
4.      Being aggrieved by the order of District Forum, the OP filed seven separate first appeal before the State Commission. All the appeals are dismissed by the State Commission by a common order dated 18.12.2017.   and the Order of the District Forum was affirmed.
Hence, these seven revision petitions filed by the OP- PUDA before this Commission.
5.      We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and None present for the respondents except the respondent Ms.Veena Rani (in RP/2846/2018).
Perused the entire material on record.
6.      Admittedly as per the terms of PUDA the seven complainants have paid the earnest money as per the area of the plot applied for. They have also paid the stipulated amount i.e. 15% of the total cost  as per the PUDA stipulation. The details of payment are stated as below:

7.      We note the State Commission categorically made the following observations:
25.     - - - There is nothing on the record to indicate that any allotment letter mentioning the plot number has been issued to the complainant at the instance of OP in this case. Merely placing on record incomplete proforma of the allotment letter of residential plot Ex.OP-2 does not show that the OP has clear cut intention to develop the project within the reasonable time frame. The complainants want refund of their money and they do not pray for delivery of possession of the plots to them in the above cases. In the circumstances of the case, when complainants do not pray for delivery of possession and only pray for refund of money, we find that District Forum rightly appreciated controversy in this case and directed the OP to refund the entire deposited amount of complainant with interest @ 9 % from the date of receipt till the date of payment and costs of litigation for non-development of project by OP within the stipulated/ scheduled time.
","26.     As a result of our above discussion, all the above referred appeals are dismissed by affirming the orders of District Forum Mansa dated 10.03.2017 under challenge in these cases.
8.      On perusal of the record, prima-facie it is the case of deficiency of service by the OP. Non-commencement of development work appears to be a casual approach of the PUDA and unnecessarily harassment to the poor consumers. Even after the expiry of four years, no development work has been started at the site. Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in many cases that if there is a delay in possession, the allottee or consumer is entitled for refund with a reasonable interest.
9.      In Fortune Infrastructure & Anr. v. Trevor D’ Lima & Ors, II (2018) CPJ 1 (SC), Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the flat allotted to him , and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid by him, alongwith compensation. Similarly, in Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank, II 2007 CPJ 17 (SC), Hon’ble Supreme Court held that when possession of the allotted plot/flat/house is not delivered within the specified time, the allottee is entitled to refund with reasonable interest from the date of payment till the date of refund.
Public authorities cannot frisk with the hard- earned money of consumers.
10.    Based on the foregoing discussions, all the revision petitions are dismissed with a stern advise of caution to the OP- Authority through imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/- in each case out of which Rs. 25,000/- shall be paid to the complainants and the remaining Rs. 25,000/- shall be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum within four weeks from today.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
11.   The learned Counsel for the Revisionist Development Authority (PUDA, now BDA) was heard.
The Complainant in Revision Petition No. 2842 of 2018, who was present in person, was heard.
None was present for the Complainants in the other 06 Revision Petitions.
The record was perused, including inter alia the Orders (07 nos.) dated 10.03.2017 of the District Forum, the impugned Order dated 18.12.2017 of the State Commission and the Memoranda of Petition in all the 07 Revision Petitions.
12.   The short point involved here is that the Complainants deposited earnest money and made further deposits with the Development Authority for residential plots. The plots were not developed within the assured period, or within a reasonable period thence.
13.   The District Forum, vide its individual Orders (07 nos.) dated 10.03.2017, ordered refund of the respective deposited amount(s) with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the respective dates of deposit till realization along with compensation of Rs. 7,000/- and cost of litigation of Rs. 3,000/-, in each case.
The Development Authority filed 07 Appeals under Section 15 of the Act 1986 before the State Commission, challenging the said 07 individual Orders dated 10.03.2017 of the District Forum.
The State Commission, vide a common Order dated 18.12.2017, dismissed the said 07 Appeals and affirmed the Orders (07 nos.) of the District Forum.
The Development Authority filed the instant 07 Revision Petitions before this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986, one each in respect of each of the 07 Complaint Cases, challenging the said Order dated 18.12.2017 of the State Commission.
14.   Similar facts and same questions of law are involved in all these 07 Revision Petitions.
As such, the 07 Revision Petitions are being disposed of vide a common Order.
15.   We may observe here that it was the prime responsibility of the Development Authority to ensure that it was in a position to develop the plots within the assured period and in all contingencies within a reasonable period thence (reasonable period here would connote such period as a reasonable man would not normally agitate).
Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
(Normal) impediments or problems that arise in Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Specifically, availability of land (/ acquisition of land), as well as all approvals from the concerned Government / Development / Municipal authorities, as and when due, being fundamental basic requirements of a construction / development Project, were decidedly the Development Authority’s primary responsibilities, and not of the Consumer(s).
Cost and Time overruns were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Non-fulfilment of its overall responsibilities of Project Planning, Execution and Completion can not be and are not grounds for condoning or overlooking delay in completion and failure to develop the plots within the assured period.
Managerial or administrative contingencies / exigencies etc., can, but, not be nebulously and irrationally contended and argued for anything and everything related to the Development Authority’s responsibilities for completion of the Project without Cost or Time overruns.
16.   It is well evinced that the subject plots were not developed within the assured period or within a reasonable period thence. In such situation, the District Forum directed for refund of the deposited amount(s) with interest (@ 9% p.a.) along with compensation (Rs.7,000/-) and cost of litigation (Rs. 3,000/-), in each case.
We find the award made by the District Forum to be just and equitable.
17.   The State Commission has concurred with the findings of the District Forum.
We find the impugned Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned.
18.   Within the ambit and scope of Section 21(b), we find no crucial error in appreciating the evidence by the two Fora below, as may cause to require de novo re-appreciation of the evidence in revision.
We find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, as may require interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b).
19.   The Development Authority, after its out-and-out ‘deficiency in service’, clearly falling within Section 2 (1) (g) & (o) of the Act 1986, agitated, unsuccessfully, in one, then two, and now three, Consumer Protection Fora, needlessly wasting public time and monies.
20.   All this is not viewed favourably.
21.   The Revision Petitions, being patently misconceived and totally bereft of merit, are dismissed, with stern advice of caution to the Development Authority by imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/- in each case, out of which Rs. 25,000/- shall be paid to the Complainant(s) in each case and Rs. 25,000/- shall be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum in each case, within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
The Development Authority through its Chief Executive is further advised to inculcate accountability and responsibility and to imbibe systemic improvements, rather than attempting to justify deficient service, mismanagement and maladministration, and wasting public time and monies in meritless litigation.
22.   Needless to add, the protection from execution, provided vide the Order dated 30.05.2019, does not survive. In case of failure or omission in compliance, the District Forum shall undertake execution as per the law.
23.   A copy each of this Order be sent by the Registry to the Chief Executive of the Revisionist Development Authority and to the Complainants in each case, within seven days of its pronouncement.

For the Respondents No.2 & 3     :         NEMO 
","1.      The present Appeal is filed by the Appellant under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, West Bengal (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No. 9/2006 dated 30.01.2009.
2.      In the Complaint Case, it was stated that on 23.06.2003, Respondent No.1/Complainant entered into a contract with Respondent No.2 /Opposite Party No.2 on High Seas Sale basis, who in turn placed an order for supply of coal in bulk from Australia with Respondent No.3/Opposite Party No.3. Respondent No.2 entered into a contract of insurance with the Appellant/Opposite Party No.1, being Marine Insurance Policy Certificates. The consignment was a total of 39037 M.T. of Riverside Hard Coking Coal, out of which 22000 M.T. was to be discharged at Paradip Port and balance was to be discharged at Haldia Port. Vessels loaded with Riverside Hard Coking Coal from the Port at Australia arrived at Paradip Port at 12.30 hrs. on 27.06.2003 and thereafter berthed at  CQ-III, Paradip at 16:40 hrs. on the same day.  The said consignment was discharged from the vessels between 27.06.2003 to 29.06.2003 at Paradip Port and the consignment was stored inside the Paradip Port at stack. The clearing of the above consignment commenced on and from 03.07.2003 and continued till 24.08.2003. Approximately 9583.511 M.T. of the consignment was cleared from the dock, but no delivery was effected on 25.08.2003 and 26.08.2003  due to non-availability of trucks and the balance quantity of approximately 12416 M.T. was still to be cleared  from the Port as on 27.08.2003. On 27.08.2003, the said consignment, however, was washed away due to heavy rain and cyclonic storm at Paradip Port. Respondent No.1 informed the incident to the Insurance Company, vide letter dated 02.09.2003 and submitted claim to the Appellant/Opposite Party No.1, dated 12.07.2004 for reimbursement of loss for shortage of 1094.640 M.T. The Appellant appointed M/s J.B. Boda Surveyors Private Limited for survey, who submitted their report on 23.04.2004, wherein they found that the claim made by Respondent No.1 was admissible and affirmed a net loss of Rs. 22,76,713/-  for shortage of 1094.640 M.T. However, inspite of the surveyors report, the Appellant kept the matter pending without giving any reason. Thereafter, the Appellant appointed Merchant Marine Surveyors and Assessors for further enquiry, but the second surveyor had not submitted any report till the date of filing the Complaint.
3.      The Appellant/Opposite Party No.1 contested the case that Respondent No.1 failed to establish insurable interest at the time of alleged loss due to heavy rain and cyclonic storm at Paradip Port on 27.08.2003. It was contended by the Appellant that the policy in question was issued in the name of PEC Limited i.e. Respondent No.2 and the alleged loss was reported on 02.09.2003 to the Appellant by PEC Limited. According to the Appellant, Respondent No.1 failed to prove that the policy was assigned on High Sea Sale in their name before the alleged reported loss and also failed to produce documents to the investigator in support of their insurable interest. The Policy should have been assigned prior to the alleged occurrence of loss in favour of Respondent No.1. The information of loss should have been given by Respondent No.1and not by Respondent No.2, PEC Limited. According to the Appellant, the Complaint petition was not maintainable as the allegations made by Respondent No.1 are baseless, had no locus-standi, devoid of merit and was liable to be dismissed. Respondent No.2 submitted that as Respondent No.1 had made no allegation against him in the Complaint, therefore no objection in writing was filed against the Complaint petition.
4.      The State Commission, vide order dated 30.01.2009, held that it was the duty of the Appellant to clearly assign reasons for appointment of the second surveyor, to Respondent No.1. The first surveyor M/s J.B. Boda stated in his report that the loss occurred at Paradip Port on 27.08.2003, which was within the specified period of storage cover. Hence, the claim was admissible. The first surveyor prepared a detailed survey report assessing the loss of Rs. 22,76,713/-. The Appellant, however, appointed second surveyor to assess the loss of Respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 was not informed about the appointment of the second surveyor. The second Surveyor neither filed affidavit supporting his contention nor was examined before the State Commission. Hence, the Complaint was allowed against the Appellant with a cost of Rs. 3000/-, dismissed against Respondent No.2 and ex-parte against Respondent No.3. The Appellant  was directed to pay Rs. 22, 76,713/- alongwith a cost of Rs. 3,000/- to Respondent No.1 within a period of two months from the date of passing the judgement, in default the above mentioned total amount shall carry interest @10% p.a. for the default period.
5.      Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the Appellant filed an Appeal before this Commission.
6.      Heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellant as well as Respondent No.1 and also carefully perused the record. Respondent No.2 PEC Ltd. obtained Marine Insurance cover for the coal imported from Australia. The total quantify of 39037 M.T. of Riverside Hard Coking Coal was contracted, out of which 22000 M.T. was to be discharged at Paradip Port and the rest at Haldia Port. As per the document filed, Respondent No.2 entered into a high sea contract with Respondent No.1 on 23.06.2003 for 2000 M.T. of coal. Contracts for the other quantity have not been filed. On 27.08.2003, Respondent No.1/Complainant alleged that the consignment of coal was washed away due to heavy rains and cyclonic storm at Paradip Port. Respondent no.1 stated that the Insurance Company was informed and claim submitted for reimbursement of loss for shortage of 1,094.640 M.T. of coal. However, it is seen from records that it was Respondent No.2 and not Respondent No.1 who filed the claim regarding loss of coal, due to heavy rains and cyclonic storm. The Insurance Company appointed M/s J.B. Boda Surveyors Pvt. Ltd. on 05.09.2003, who submitted their report on 23.04.2004, wherein the claim of Respondent No.1 was found admissible. Net loss assessed was Rs.22,76,713/- for shortage of 1094.640 M.T. of coal. A careful perusal of the report of the Surveyor reveals that several crucial aspects were not looked into or were assumed.
7.      For any insurance claim the most important element is the insurable interest in favour of the claimant. No evidence was produced by Respondent No.1 as to assignment of the policy in its favour by Respondent No.2 who took the marine insurance policies. In this respect, Section 52 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1963 is relevant, which is reproduced as under: -
“52. When and how policy is assignable.—
(1) A marine policy may be transferred by assignment unless it contains terms expressly prohibiting assignment. It may be assigned either before or after loss.
(2) Where a marine policy has been assigned so as to pass the beneficial interest in such policy, the assignee of the policy is entitled to sue thereon in his own name; and the defendant is entitled to make any defence arising out of the contract which he would have been entitled to make if the suit had been brought in the name of the person by or on behalf of whom the policy was effected.
(3) A marine policy may be assigned by endorsement thereon or in other customary manner.”
8.      It is also noted that if the policy had been assigned, Respondent No.1 ought to have kept the Appellant informed of the same. No evidence was produced of any communication of the assignment of insurance to the Appellant by Respondent No.1. During the hearing of the matter, no evidence/documents of transactions/assignment of the policy could be produced by Respondent No.1 despite specific direction and order dated 11.10.2018. Further Respondent No.1 should have given intimation about the loss and made claim with the Insurance Company. On the contrary, Respondent No.2, and not Respondent No.1, made the claim for the alleged loss. The claim was repudiated by the Appellant, vide letter dated 20.02.2006, addressed to Respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 did not challenge the repudiation of the claim by the Appellant.
9.      The Surveyors had also not taken note of the crucial piece of evidence filed by the Appellant i.e. a letter dated 29.12.2003 by Paradip Port Trust calling upon Respondent No.1 to clear 1094.60 M.T. cargo claimed to have been lost by Respondent No.1, as far back as 27.08.2003. If the quantity of 1094.60 M.T. of cargo got washed away due to heavy rains and cyclonic storm on 27.08.2003, Paradip Port Trust would not have called upon Respondent No.1 to clear the same quantity of coal said to be lying with them on 29.12.2003.
10.    It is for these very reasons, among others, that the Appellant appointed an Investigator Merchant Marine Surveyors and Assessors in June, 2005 who submitted their report on 29.08.2005. The Investigator’s report clearly established that there was no proof of loss of 1094.60 M.T. of cargo. Appellant was well within its right to appoint an Investigator whenever any doubt arose as to the nature of the claim.
11.    There was no second surveyor appointed by the Appellant- Insurance Company. The Appellant had appointed only one Surveyor and thereafter an investigator was appointed. Reliance is placed by the Appellant on the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Harjeet Rice Mills, III (2005) CPJ 6 (SC), wherein the Insurance Company had engaged a private Investigator who reported that fire might not have been caused by short-circuit as was claimed by the insured and that it could have been arson or a deliberate attempt to make an insurance claim. The claimant contended that the report of the private investigator could not be booked into in the light of Section 64 UM of the Insurance Act. Rejecting the contention, it was held that Section 64 UM of the Insurance Act cannot stand in the way of the Insurance Company in establishing that the claim was a fraud on the company.
12.    Based on the report of the Investigator, the Appellant/Insurance Company rightly repudiated the claim of the Complainant, vide letter dated 22.02.2006. The State Commission failed to take into consideration two crucial aspects of insurable interest and the letter of the Paradip Port Trust. The order passed by the State Commission is set aside and the Appeal allowed.

4.      The insured died on 06.10.2010. Her son Narender Kumar, the petitioner filed insurance claim for all the policies with necessary claim papers. It was alleged that OPs repudiated the claim without any sufficient reason. Being aggrieved, the complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum, Narnaul.
5.      The opposite party LIC in its written statement submitted that at the time of obtaining insurance policies the insured had concealed a material fact. She was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and underwent Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR ) surgery in 2003.
6.      The District Forum, after hearing the parties, allowed the complaint.
7.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 separate appeals before the State Commission.
","8.      The State Commission allowed all the appeals with a common Order dated 12.04.2016 because the question of facts and law involved was identical and consequently dismissed all the complaints.
9.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 revision petitions before this Commission under section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
10.    Heard the learned counsel for both sides. Perused the entire material on record.
11.    The State Commission clearly observed in paras 10, 16 and 21 of its Order dated 12.04.2016 that the insured suppressed the material facts while filling the proposal form. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as below:
10.  LIC also sought the opinion of Dr. R.R. Kasiwal. It has been certified by Dr. Kasliwal vide Exhibit R – 7 that earlier the patient (insured ) was admitted in the hospital on September 22nd, 2010 and was discharged on 27th 2010. In column No. 4, the nature of ailment has been mentioned “breathlessness, RHD, Post MVR (2003) Severe TR”. From these two documents (Exhibit R- 6 & R-7), it is clear that the insured was a patient of Rheumatic Heart Disease and Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) was performed in 2003.

16.     On the aforesaid facts and principle enunciated, the right to claim insurance benefits by the complainants does not survive in view of the medical record, that is, Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R. Kasliwal. Thus, it stands established to the hilt that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the Insurance Policies and she suppressed this fact in her statements (proposal forms) made at the time of purchasing the insurance policies.
- - - -
21. In the case in hand, LIC has proved by leading cogent evidence consisting of Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R Kasliwal, Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the insurance policies. So, the authorities referred to above are no help to the complainants.
- - -
12.    Thus it is apparent that the insured was a known case of RHD and underwent MVR surgery before obtaining the policy. She had not disclosed the information about her treatment in the proposal form at column no. 11. Thus it was a material suppression of facts which is not acceptable in a contract of insurance, which is a contract in good faith, uberrima fides.
13.    Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Commission have held in several cases about the concealment of material information. In the case of Modern Insulators Ltd. Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2000) 2 SCC 734, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
It is the fundamental principle of insurance law that utmost good faith must be observed by the contracting parties and the good faith forbids either party from non-disclosure of the facts which the parties know. ………
14.    We have perused the written version filed by the LIC of India before the District Forum. It is pertinent to note that in its written version, the stand taken by the LIC of India (OP) was as below:
The opp. Parties are not liable for making any payment to the complainant under the above said policies. Therefore keeping in the view the above said facts the complainant is not entitled to get any relief. The decision dated 01.08.2011 passed by the Sr. Divisional Manager is according to law and facts and is in favour of principle of natural justice and falls within definition of self speaking decision, hence the claim of the complainant was rightly repudiated by the competent authority as per terms and conditions of the policy and admitted the liability to refund the 90% of first premium paid under the policy. The complainant has concealed the real material facts before the Hon’ble consumer forum and misleading the Hon’ble forum by presenting wrong facts. Hence the complainant is not entitled to any relief as claimed in the complaint.
(emphasis supplied)
15.    We find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned and needs more interference and the same is affirmed.  There is no merit in the revision petitions and the same are dismissed.
16.    In reference to paragraph no. 14, we note that the deceased insured had paid certain amount(s) towards first premium(s) in every policy. Therefore, the LIC of India shall refund 90% of the first premium amount in respect of each policy paid by the insured as admitted by the LIC of India in its written statement. The refund may be ensured within four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this Order, else it will carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment.
With this direction all the revision petitions are disposed of.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
17.    Heard the Petitioner in person and the learned Counsel for the Respondent. Perused the material on record.
18.    In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Petitioner, to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing these 09 Revision Petitions is condoned.
19.    The short point in this matter is that one Smt. Laxmi Devi, the insured, the mother of one Mr. Narendra Kumar Jain, the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, had purchased 09 life insurance policies from the LIC, the Opposite Party, the Respondent herein, in which the Complainant was the nominee.
The dates of commencement of the policies were 28.12.2008 (04 policies) and 01.01.2009 (05 policies).
The insured expired on 06.10.2010, i.e. within two years of commencement of the policies.
The LIC repudiated the claim on the ground that the insured was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and had undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, this fact was not disclosed in the proposal form / personal statement, the insured made deliberate incorrect statements and withheld correct information regarding her health. As such the LIC repudiated the said 09 claims, but admitted to its liability to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions.
As evident from its written version, the LIC took the same stand before the District Forum, that the claims were repudiated for deliberate incorrect statements and withholding correct information regarding her health by the insured but 90% of the first premium paid in each policy would be refunded as per the policy conditions.
20.    The District Forum had allowed the Complaints.
The State Commission, in appeal, has dismissed the Complaints, inter alia observing that “12.  In the proposal forms, the insured stated that her usual state of health was good and she never suffered from any heart disease, liver, stomach etc. Thus, from the evidence available on record, it is established that insured had concealed the material fact with regard to her health.”.
21.    An insurance contract has to be in utmost good faith, by both sides. And in a life insurance contract, existence of pre-existing disease / health condition is a material question, necessarily required to be answered truthfully.
22.    In the instant matter, the insured, while taking multiple (09) life insurance policies, suppressed the (pre-) existence of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and of having undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, which were material facts.
The appraisal made by the State Commission conclusively determines willful and intentional suppression of material facts.
And there is no mitigating factor. It is reasonable and appropriate to say that
the insured knew what she was signing, she knew the significance of the
information being supplied by her.
23.    The State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
24.    It goes without saying that the LIC would be duty-bound to comply with its affirmation to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions. If the said refund has not already made in respect of each policy, it shall be made within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order, failing which the said amount(s) shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment(s).
25.    Disposed.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Rajesh Mootha, Advocate for ICICI
					Bank Ltd. 
  For the Respondent      :In person 
","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
The complainant who is the petitioner in RP/2077/2018 and respondent in RP/1357/2018 had a savings bank account with ICICI Bank Ltd., which is petitioner in RP/1357/2018 and respondent in RP/2077/2018.  On 23.4.2014, a debit of Rs.22,466/- was made in his savings bank account, as a result of which the balance in the said account became NIL.  A cheque, which the complainant had issued on 05.6.2014 came to be dishonoured for want of funds in his savings bank account.  Being aggrieved, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint, seeking refund of the aforesaid amount along with interest and compensation etc.
2.     The complaint was resisted by the Bank, primarily on the ground that the complainant is an ex-employee of ICICI Bank Ltd. and a sum of Rs.62,500/- was credited in his saving bank account on 18.9.2013, towards salary of the notice period before terminating his service.  On the same day, a sum of Rs.70,902/- was credited in his account in full and final settlement of his dues.  Thereafter, a sum of Rs.62,386/- was credited in his account towards full and final settlement of his dues but this was done, without adjusting the amount of Rs.62,500/- which the bank had already credited in his account on 18.9.2013.  On noticing the same, the bank debited the amount available in the saving bank account of the complainant.
3.     The District Forum having dismissed the consumer complaint, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 06.3.2018 the State Commission allowed the appeal by directing the Bank to pay Rs.10,000/- as compensation to the complainant along with the cost quantified at Rs.5,000/-.  The aforesaid amount was to carry interest @ 9% per annum if the order was not complied within one month.  Since both the parties are aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, both of them are before this Commission.
4.     The only question involved in these petitions is as to whether the ICICI Bank Ltd. was entitled to debit the amount lying in the Savings Bank Account of the Complainant, without any authorisation / request from him, merely because it had made excess payment towards salary for the notice period to the complainant.
5.     Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act to the extent it is relevant provides that the bankers may, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, retain as a security for a general balance of account, any goods bailed to them.  The aforesaid section came up for consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Syndicate Bank vs. Vijay Kumar & Ors., AIR 1992 SC 1066.  In the aforesaid case, the respondent no. 3 before the Hon’ble Supreme Court deposited two sums, one of Rs. 65,000/- and the other of Rs. 25,000/-, by way of two separate fixed deposits receipts, so as to enable the Bank to furnish a bank guarantee on behalf of judgment debtor firm in favour of the Registrar, High Court of Delhi.  The fixed deposits receipts were duly discharged by signing on their reverse.  Later, the Bank guarantee issued in favour of the Registrar of the High Court was discharged by the Court.  The decree holder got a sum of Rs. 35,000/-, out of the amount of Rs. 90,000/-, which respondent no. 3 had deposited with the Bank by way of FDR, attached on the ground that the said amount belonged to the judgment debtor firm of which respondent no. 3 was a partner.  The High Court rejected the plea of the Bank that the aforesaid amount could not be attached, since the Bank had a lien on the FDRs against dues in an overdraft account.  It was contended on behalf of the Bank that it had a lien over the amount deposited by the judgment debtor and as banker they had a right to hold the security, in respect of overdraft amount.  Accepting the contention, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, inter-alia, held that the Bank has a general lien over all forms of securities or negotiable instruments, deposited by or on behalf of the customers in the ordinary course of banking business and such a general lien is a valuable right of the banker, judicially recognised, and in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the banker has a general lien over such security received from the customer in the ordinary course of banking business and has a right to use the proceeds in respect of any balance that may be due from the customer by way of reduction of the customer’s debit balance.
This issue also came up for consideration of the Karnataka High Court in Smt. K. S. Nagalambika vs. Corporation Bank & Anr., AIR 2000 Kant 201.  In the aforesaid case, the plaintiff had deposited money with the bank and obtained fixed deposits receipts in their name.  On maturity, the said deposits were not paid by the Bank on the ground that the plaintiff was a surety for a loan taken by his wife and the amount of the FDR was accordingly adjusted by the Bank towards the loan account of the wife.  Claiming the adjustment to be illegal, a suit was filed for recovery of the adjusted amount alongwith interest.  The Bank contended that it had general lien and therefore, was entitled to adjust the amount towards the loan account.  Relying upon the decision of the Hon’ble Apex Court in Vijay Kumar & Ors. (supra), it was held that undoubtedly the Bank had a lien over the FDRs.
However, in my opinion, Section 171 of the India Contract Act entitles a bank to retain a security, only for the purpose of recovering an amount which is due to it in its capacity as a banker.  The general lien under Section 171 of the Contract Act, in my opinion, is restricted to the dues which the bank can claim and recover in its capacity as a banker and does not extend to the dues to which it is entitled in some other capacity.  In other words, an amount due to the bank in its capacity as an employer from it erstwhile employee cannot be recovered by exercising a general lien in terms of Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act. The amount which the bank was seeking to recover from the complainant was payable to it in its capacity as the ex-employer of the complainant and not in its capacity as a banker.  The bank cannot be allowed to use Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act to recover that amount merely because the account of the complainant happened to have been opened with it.  Had the savings bank account of the complainant been with some other bank other than ICICI Bank Ltd., the said bank obviously would not have been able to debit the above referred amount of
Rs.22,466/- from that account since it would have no control on that account.  The bank therefore, could not have recovered that amount by debiting the amount, which was available in the account of the complainant.
6.     In Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. Vs. Attar-Ul-Nissa & Ors. AIR 1967 SC 540, one Sultan Mohd. had borrowed Rs.45,000/- from the Jammu & Kashmir Bank on the basis of a promissory Note.  The bank made an erroneous credit of Rs.28,029/15 to the account of Sultan Mohd.  The said entries were later credited by the bank.  In a Suit filed by the bank for recovery of the amount due from Sultan Mohd., it was claimed by the respondents that the bank could not have reversed the credit entries in the account of Sultan Mohd.  It would be pertinent to note here that the credit entries in the account of Sultan Mohd. were reversed at the instance of Accountant General of the State.  The High Court held that the bank was not entitled to reverse the credit entry made in the account and pay that money back to the person who had deposited it even though that person may have made the deposit by mistake.  The High Court was of the view that as soon as the money is credited in the account of the Constituent, it becomes his money and the bank cannot pay it back to the person who paid it to the account of the Constituent, on his representation that it was paid by mistake.  Approving the view taken by the High Court, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held that though on facts there was double payment for a certain period due to mistake on the part of the Government, it was not open to the bank to debit the amount of the Constituent like Sultan Mohd., without his authority.
The Bank relied upon the provisions of Section 72 of the Contract Act, in support, the debit entry made by it.  Rejecting the contention, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia observed that Section 72 will only apply to a case of two persons one paying the money and the other receiving the money on behalf of the person paying it.  In such a case, if payment is made by mistake, the person receiving the money must return it.  But Section 72 has no application to a case where the money is paid by a person to a Bank with instructions that it should be deposited in the account of a third person, who is a Constituent of the bank. It was also held that the bank was not concerned with any mistake made by the Accountant General in sending the money to the bank for credit the same to the account of Sultan Mohd. and it was open to them to recover the amount paid by mistake from Sultan Mohd.  A bank however, could not reverse the entries and pay out money from the account of Sultan Mohd., without his authority.
7.     In the present case, though the amount debited in the account of the complainant belonged to ICICI Bank Ltd., the said amount was not due to it in its capacity as the banker of the complainant.  The said amount was due and payable to ICICI Bank Ltd. in its capacity as the ex-employer of the complainant.  Therefore, instead of debiting the aforesaid amount taking advantage of the complainant having the said account with it, the ICICI Bank Ltd. should have taken recourse to legal proceedings to recover the excess payment from the complainant.
8.     The next question which arises for consideration is as to what would be the appropriate order to be passed in this case.  Though, in my opinion the bank ought not to have debited the amount of Rs.22,466/-  in the account of the complainant, the fact remains that the complainant was legally liable to return the said amount to the bank if it was paid by mistake.  Therefore, it would not be just and fair to direct the bank to return the aforesaid amount of Rs.22,466/- to the complainant.  At the same time it cannot be disputed that the bank has been deficient in rendering services to the complainant since it debited the aforesaid amount of Rs.22,466/- from the account of the complainant, without any authorisation from him.  The Bank therefore must compensate the complainant for the aforesaid deficiency on its part in rendering services to the complainant.  The State Commission having directed payment of a token compensation of Rs.10,000/- to the complainant, along with cost of litigation quantified at Rs.5,000/-, the order passed by the State Commission, in my opinion, does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
","9.     Both the revision petitions are therefore, dismissed.  ICICI Bank Ltd., petitioner in RP/1357/2018 is granted four weeks from today to pay compensation and cost in terms of the order of the State Commission.  No interest would be payable if the said payment is made within four weeks from today.  However, interest on the compensation amount of Rs.10,000/- would be payable from the date of the order of the State Commission in case this order is not complied by the Bank within four weeks from today.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. B.S.Banthia, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :In person 
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioners Branch Manager, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and anr. against the order dated 18.09.2018 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Madhya Pradesh, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Appeal no.2467 of 2013.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant’s sister Smt Shiv Kumari Avwadhiya (deceased) had availed a Life Insurance Policy bearing no. 17686425 on 09.08.2010 for basic sum assured of Rs.10,00,000/-. On 25.03.2012 the policyholder died suddenly due to cardiac arrest. After the death of the policyholder, the respondent presented the death certificate and Xerox copy of the policy to the petitioner/OP for the claim amount.  As per the instruction of OP, the respondent sent a written application for the claim on 17.05.2012 along with other documents but opposite parties failed to pay the claim amount to the respondent.  The respondent filed the complaint before District Forum for deficiency in services on the part of the petitioner. District Forum vide its order dated 12.08.2013 allowed the complaint against opposite parties with the cost of Rs. 20,000/-. District Forum directed opposite party No.1 to pay the amount of Rs.10,000/- as compensation to the complainant. District Forum further directed opposite party no.2 to pay the insurance claim amount of Rs.10,00,000/- along with interest @ 10% p.a. from 3 months after the claim date, within 4 months from this order.
3.      Aggrieved with the above order of the District Forum, the opposite parties/petitioners filed an appeal before the State Commission, which was dismissed vide its order dated 18.09.2018.
4.      Hence, the opposite parties have filed the revision petition before this commission.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the respondent in person.  Learned counsel for the petitioners stated that the complainant never submitted the insurance claim in the claim form to the Insurance Company.  In the written statement filed before the District Forum, it was clearly stated that the complainant may be asked to submit the claim before the Insurance Company so that proper decision may be taken by the Insurance Company.  However, the District Forum passed the final order allowing the complaint and directed the Insurance Company to pay the insurance amount of Rs.10,00,000/- along with 10% p.a. interest.  The same plea was taken in the appeal filed before the State Commission, but the State Commission also did not consider this vital aspect.  The role of the Forum starts if there is any deficiency on the part of the opposite parties.  However, in the present case, no deficiency can be attributed to the opposite party Insurance Company because the Insurance Company could not get any opportunity to take a decision on the claim of the complainant.
6.      In response to the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners, the respondent stated that the death certificate along with application was sent to the local office of the Insurance Company.  All the documents were sent by registered post, but the same were refused by the employees of the Insurance Company.  Thus, there was no alternative but to file a consumer complaint before the District Forum.  District Forum after being convinced allowed the complaint.   The State Commission has also concurred with the order of the District Forum. Against the concurrent finding of the fora below, the scope under the revision petition is quite limited and facts cannot be reassessed. Both the fora below have allowed the genuine claim of the complainant and therefore, no interference is required by this Commission.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the parties and have examined the record.  Even, if the petitioners had taken the plea before the District Forum that claim was not submitted in the required form along with documents but, when District Forum finally allowed the complaint, it is not clear as to why the opposite parties did not prefer the appeal on substantive grounds.  The Insurance Company had got enough time to have the matter investigated and based on that investigation they should have either decided the claim or should have contested the case.  The District Forum and the State Commission have given clear finding that the documents were sent to the Insurance Company, but the same were refused as evidenced by the remark on the envelope.  Against the concurrent finding by the fora below in respect of the fact that the Insurance Company refused to take the documents sent by the complainant, this Commission has very little choice to reverse this finding.  Moreover, petitioners have not filed any such evidence which could help such reversal of finding.
8.      The petitioner Insurance Company is litigating this case at the third stage and still no substantive objection has been raised against the claim.  There was enough time for the Insurance Company to have investigated the matter and if there was anything against the claim, the Insurance Company should have come out with those facts.  When the Insurance Company refused to take cognizance of the claim submitted by the complainant and also refused to accept the documents sent by the complainant, the complainant had no choice but to approach the District Forum.  As there is no substantive objection from the side of the Insurance Company in respect of the insurance claim, I do not find any opportunity to interfere in the approval of claim by the fora below.  However, I feel that the interest awarded by the District Forum is on a higher side and accordingly, it is reduced to 6% p.a. from 10% p.a. as awarded by the District Forum and concurred by the State Commission.
9.      Based on the above discussion, the orders of the fora below are upheld except that the Insurance Company shall pay interest @6% p.a. on the insurance amount of Rs.10,00,000/- from the date of order of the District Forum till actual payment instead of 10% as allowed by the District Forum. As the interest has been provided on the insurance amount, no separate compensation is required.  Accordingly, the order of Rs.10,000/- as compensation is set aside. This order be complied by the petitioners/Opposite parties within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER HON'BLE MR. C. VISWANATH,MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Chandrashekhar A Chakalabbi, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","These revision petitions have been filed by the petitioner Savita Kom Nataraj Naragund & ors. against the common order dated 21.06.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Karnataka, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal Nos.2168-2176 and 2178- 2189 of 2016 filed by the petitioners herein against the orders of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Uttar Kannada at Karwar, (in short ‘the District Forum’) passed in CC Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 of 2014.  As the issue is same in all the revision petitions and the impugned order is also similar in nature, these revision petitions are being decided together.
2.      The brief facts of these cases are that the petitioner is the wife of the erstwhile partner of a firm namely, Gajanan Finance Corporation. The partnership firm took amounts from the respondents/complainants for fixed deposit to be issued by the firm.  The fixed deposit receipts were also issued to the respondents. However, the payments were not made by the firm on the date of maturity of these fixed deposits. Accordingly, the respondents/complainants filed consumer complaints with the District Forum being  CC Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46 of 2014. These complaints were resisted by the petitioners by filing the written statement in each case, however, the District Forum allowed the complaints by passing the following order:-
“The complaint nos.25/2014, 26/2014, 27/2014, 28/2014, 29/2014,
30/2014,31/2014,32/2014,33/2014,34/2014,35/2014,36/2014,37/2014,38/2014,39/2014,40/2014,41/2014,42/2014,43/2014,44/2014,45/2014 and 46/2014 are allowed in part with cost.
The OPs are hereby directed to pay jointly and severally to the complainant-
1. In CC No.25/2015 Rs.6,52,937/- towards S.B.A./C balance amount.
2.   In CC No.26/2014 Rs.1,80,000/- in CC No.27/2014 Rs.1,60,000, in CC No.28/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.29/2014, Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.30/2014, Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.31/2014, Rs,1,80,000/-, in CC No.32/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.33/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.34/2014, Rs.90,000/- in CC No.35/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.36/2014, Rs.,80,000/-, in CC No.37/2014, Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.38/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, inCC No.39/2014, Rs.90,000/- in CC No.40/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.41/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.42/2014 Rs.40,000/-. In CC No.43/2014 Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.44/2014, Rs.90,000/-, and in CC No.46/2014 Rs.90,000/-, toward FDs maturity amount with interest @12% pa in respect of CC No.26/2014 to 46/2014 and in CC No.25/2014 from the date of last entry at Ex.C-1 till the date of deposit of the amount before the Forum.OPs are granted for one month time for depositing the amount before the Forum from the date of receipt of this order.
3. The liability in respect of OP-2 to 5 is restricted to the estate of late Nataraj J. Nargund in their hands.  The liability of OP-10(a) to (d) is also similarly to the estate of deceased OP-10 in their hands.
4.       The OPs also hereby directed to pay to the complainants a sum of Rs.10,000/- towards compensation in each case.
5.       The OPs also hereby directed to pay to the complainants a sum of Rs.2,000/- towards cost in each case.”
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioners herein preferred appeals being FA Nos.2168 to 2189 of 2016 before the State Commission.  The State Commission vide its order dated 21.06.2019 dismissed these appeals.
4.      Hence the present revision petitions.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners at the admission stage.  Learned counsel stated that the amounts were deposited as investment by the respondents/complainants and therefore, the transactions were of commercial nature.  The cases of the respondents are not covered under the explanation attached to Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and therefore, the complainants were not maintainable before the District Forum as the transactions were for commercial purpose.  Learned counsel referred to the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Punjab University Vs. Unit Trust of India and others, (2015) 2 SCC 669, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed the following:-
“21. It is thus seen from the above extracts from Laxmi Engg. Works that Section 2(1) (d)(i) is discussed exclusively by this Court.  We are of the opinion that clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 2(1)(d) of the Act must be interpreted harmoniously and in light of the same, we find that the Explanation following Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act would be clarificatory in nature and would apply to the present case and as held by this Court in Laxmi Engg. Works, the term “commercial purpose” must be interpreted considering the facts and circumstances of each case.”
6.      On the basis of the above judgment, it was stated by the learned counsel that FDRs were purchased for investment purpose and for earning profits and therefore, the complainants/respondents are not the consumers. Hence the orders passed by the fora below are illegal are required to be set aside.
7.      It was stated that the fora below also failed to appreciate that the criminal proceedings initiated by the complainants have resulted in the investigating officer filing a ‘B’ report which is indicative of the fact that there was no material against the petitioners.
8.       It was further stated that both the fora below ought to have appreciated that Mr. Nataraj was the face of the partnership firm and only upon his death that the claims have been made by the complainants.  There was no explanation for the complainants for not raising claims any time before the death of Mr. Nataraj.  The complainants have clearly taken advantage of the death of the important person in the partnership firm by filing the present complaints.
9.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and examined the record. The banking services are covered under Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Section 2(o) reads as under:-
“2(o)   “service” means service of any description which is made available to potential [users and includes, but not limited to, the provision of] facilities in connection with banking, financing insurance, transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or both, [housing construction] entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service;”
10.    Therefore, a person can file complaint under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for the deficiency in service for a service provided by a bank or a financial institution. Moreover, this Commission in  Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. CTJ 141 (CP) (NCDRC), has taken a view that the banking services are covered under the Consumer Protection Act 1986.  It has been held:-
“18. Further, what is commercial purpose is discussed by the Apex Court in various decisions.
19.     We would refer to few relevant judgments:
In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Vs. Shiv Kumar Joshi, (2000) 1 SCC 98, the Court elaborately considered the provisions of Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(o) as well as earlier decisions and held that-
“The combined reading of the definitions of “consumer” and “service” under the Act and looking at the aims and object for which the Act was enacted, it is imperative that the words “consumer” and “service” as defined under the Act should be construed to comprehend consumer and services of commercial and trade-oriented nature only. Thus any person who is found to have hired services for consideration shall be deemed to be a consumer notwithstanding that the services were in connection with any goods or their user. Such services may be for any connected commercial activity and may also relate to the services as indicated in Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.”
21. The aforesaid ratio makes it abundantly clear that services may be for any connected commercial activity, yet it would be within the purview of the Act.
29. Further, from the aforesaid discussion, it is apparent that even taking wide meaning of the words ‘for any commercial purpose’ it would mean that goods purchased or services hired should be used in any activity directly intended to generate profit. Profit is the main aim of commercial purpose. But, in a case where goods purchased or services hired in an activity which is not directly intended to generate profit, it would not be commercial purpose.”
11.    In Canara Bank Vs. M/s. Jain Motor Trading Company & Anr., F.A. No. 432 of 2008, decided on 29.07.2013; this Commission has held as follows:
“10.    We also do not accept the contention of Counsel for Appellant/Bank that Respondent being a commercial firm is not a ‘consumer’ as per the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Commercial concerns per se are not excluded from filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 if it does not involve direct generation of profits or resale.  Also as stated in the instant case, the OCC facility was sought from Appellant/Bank to help resolve the financial difficulties being faced by Respondent which was not per se a commercial activity generating profits.  As pointed out by Counsel for Respondent, these aspects are well settled in a number of judgments, including of this Commission as also of the Hon’ble Supreme Court e.g. Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [I (2005) CPJ 27 (NC)] and Madan Kumar Singh Vs. Distt. Magistrate, Sultanpur [(2009) 9 SCC 79].”
12.    From the above decisions, it is amply clear that a person availing the services of a bank is a consumer and can file a consumer complaint before the consumer forum for the deficiency on the part of the bank.
13.    It has been argued by the learned counsel that the criminal proceedings initiated by the complainants have not resulted into any action against the petitioners.  It is an accepted principle of law that the criminal liability and the civil liability are two different aspects of liability.  The learned counsel has only stated that the investigating officer has filed a ‘B’ report.  It is not clear whether the report has been accepted by the competent criminal court.  Even if there is no criminal liability, the civil liability may remain and can be decided.  It has been argued by the learned counsel that Mr. Nataraj was the main partner of the partnership firm and the claim has been filed after his death and the complainants have taken advantage of his death.  It is not the case of the petitioners that the claims are fraudulent.  In fact, a partnership firm is not a legal person and the partners are responsible for any act or omission on the part of the partnership firm.  Hence, the liability clearly devolves on the partner and thus, it will also extend to the LRs of the partner if expired.  Thus, from this angle also, we do not find any merit in the revision petitions preferred by the petitioners.
","14.    Based on the above discussion, we do not find any merit in the revision petitions as no illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error is found in the order dated 21.06.2019 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Accordingly, the revision petition Nos.307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326 and 327 of 2020 are dismissed at the admission stage.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. DINESH SINGH,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Sandeep Suri, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.       Heard learned counsel for the revisionist bank.
Perused the material on record.
2.     This revision petition has been filed under section 21(b) of the Act 1986 against the Order dated 10.01.2020 of the State Commission in F.A. No. 736 of 2019.
3.     The said Order dated 10.01.2020 of the State Commission inter alia reads as below:
M.A. No. 2393 of 2019 (for Delay)
- - -
2.       As per report of the Registry, cost of Rs. 2,000/- has not been deposited by the applicants / appellants. Learned counsel for the applicants / appellants prays for deposit of the cost today itself. The said prayer of the applicants / appellants cannot be accepted and the time cannot be extended as it will amount to review of our own order and we have no power to recall our own order. - - -
3.       Since the cost has not been deposited by applicants / appellants, the delay cannot be said to be condoned, as the deposit of cost was condition precedent to condone the delay and we have no option except to dismiss the application for condonation of delay. Accordingly, the application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal stands dismissed, due to non-deposit of costs.
Main Case
4.       Since the application for condonation of delay is dismissed, hence the appeal filed by the appellants is also dismissed being barred by limitation.
- - -
.
","4.     Evidently, the State Commission had condoned the delay in filing the First Appeal before it, subject to cost of Rs.2,000/- to be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission before the next date fixed by the State Commission. The said cost was not deposited within the stipulated period. The State Commission could not review its own Order, and, thus, could not extend the period for depositing the said cost. Consequently, the application for condonation of delay was dismissed, as the cost for condoning the delay had not been deposited within the stipulated period. Resultantly, the First Appeal was dismissed as being barred by limitation.
5.     In the given facts and specificities of the case, but without in any manner entering into its merits, it is felt just and appropriate that the matter be holistically adjudicated on merit, on facts and law, in the Appellate Forum, i.e. the State Commission, with the affording of the due opportunity to both sides.
6.     Accordingly, in the interest of justice, and for examination of the case on merit in the Appellate Forum, a time of four weeks from today is granted to the petitioner bank to deposit cost for condonation of delay in filing the First Appeal before the State Commission; the cost, however, shall, now, be Rs. 20,000/- (rather than Rs.2,000/- imposed by the State Commission), to be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission. In addition, the respondent complainant shall be paid an amount of Rs.10,000/- by the petitioner bank to cover travel and allied expenses within the same period of four weeks from today.
7.     The State Commission is requested to adjudicate the First Appeal No. 736 of 2019 on merit, after issuing notice again to the respondent complainant if he does not put in appearance on the date hereinafter being fixed.
8.     Both sides, that is, the bank and the complainant, both, shall appear before the State Commission on 05.03.2020.
9.     The principal onus of informing the respondent complainant of this instant Order, and, specifically, of the date fixed before the State Commission (i.e. 05.03.2020), shall be on the revisionist bank. It may do so, without fail, within two weeks from today.
10.   It is made clear that if the cost of Rs. 20,000/- imposed for condonation of delay is not deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission within the (now) stipulated period of four weeks from today, or if the amount of Rs.10,000/- towards travel and allied expenses is not paid to the respondent complainant within the same period of four weeks from today, this revision petition shall be treated as failed and the State Commission’s impugned Order of 10.01.2020 shall sustain.
11.   In case the respondent complainant has any objection to the afore, both sides, i.e. the revisionist bank and the respondent complainant, both, shall present themselves before this Commission on 08.04.2020 at New Delhi, for this Commission to consider the objection of the respondent complainant and to pass appropriate order.
12.   The Registry is directed to send a copy each of this Order to the State Commission and to the respondent complainant within three days from today.
‘Dasti’, in addition.

  For the Respondent      :
","Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused record.
2.     This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner challenging the order dated 03.09.2019 passed by the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Aurangabad (‘the State Commission’) in Revision Petition no. 47 of 2019, wherein the State Commission has restored on the file of the District Forum the application of the respondent moved for recovery of the amount deposited by the respondent and subsequently paid to the complainant by the District Forum in the wake of dismissal of the complaint by the State Commission. The State Commission has also asked the District Forum to give directions to the petitioner to deposit the amount within certain period and to pass order as per requirement of the case in accordance with law.  The District Forum then issued notice to the original complainant and started the proceedings under section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 vide its order dated 22.01.2020. The District Forum vide its order dated 28.02.2020 issued N.B.W against the petitioner herein. The petitioner is aggrieved by the issuance of the N.B. Warrant, but has filed the revision challenging the order dated 03.09.2019 of the State Commission. Once the order of the State Commission has been implemented and the District Forum has issued process in the execution case, it seems that the petitioner has not approached this Commission in time. In fact, there is a delay of 81 days in filing the present revision petition. It has been mentioned in the application for condonation of delay that the petitioner did not receive any free copy of the order and as the order of the State Commission dated 03.09.2019 was an ex-parte order, the petitioner did not have any information about this order until the summons were received from the District Forum. It is seen from the order dated 22.01.2020 that the petitioner was present before the District Forum after receiving the notice from the District Forum. Thus, the version of the petitioner may be believed and we condone the delay in filing the present revision petition. However, it is seen that the State Commission vide it's order dated 08.09.2015 in Appeal No. 314 of 2014 filed by the opposite party against the order dated 12.05.2014 passed by the District Forum in complaint case No. 361 of 2013 allowed the appeal of the opposite party and dismissed the complaint of the petitioner herein. The petitioner had challenged the order of the State Commission by filing a revision petition No.3097 of 2015 before this Commission and this Commission vide its order dated 8th March 2016 passed the following order:-
“Since the vehicle in question was in the name of the son of the complainant, the impugned orders are set aside and the complainant is permitted to withdraw the complaint. We make it clear that the son of the complainant, in whose name the vehicle was taken, will be at liberty to file a fresh complaint in his name in accordance with law.
In case a fresh complaint is filed by the son of the complainant, he shall also be entitled to seek extension of time in terms of Section 24 A of the Consumer Protection Act on the ground that his father was bonafidely prosecuting the complaint before the District Forum. As and when filed, such an application will be decided on its own merits.
","The revision petition stands disposed of”.
3.     From the above order of this Commission, it is clear that the orders of fora below were set aside and the petitioner was permitted to withdraw the complaint and liberty was granted that the vehicle owner may file the complaint afresh. It is thus clear that the complaint filed by the petitioner herein has lost its existence after the order dated 8th March 2016 passed by this Commission. Once the complaint is no more, the order passed by the District Forum becomes non-existent and thus there would be no need for the respondent opposite party to deposit any amount in compliance of the order of the District Forum and if the amount has been deposited, the respondent deserves it's refund. The petitioner herein is legally bound to return the amount deposited by the respondent and released to the complainant. Thus, we do not see any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 03.09.2019 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this commission. Accordingly, Revision Petition No. 550 of 2020 is dismissed.
4.     The impugned order of the State Commission has already been implemented by the District Forum and process has been issued by the District Forum. If the petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 28.02.2020 of the District Forum issuing N.B.W against the petitioner herein, the petitioner is entitled to prefer an appeal before the State Commission under Section 27A of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and liberty is granted for the same.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :IN PERSON 
  For the Respondent      :
","The present Appeal, under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”), has been filed against the order dated 25.03.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Karnataka, Bangalore (for short “the State Commission”) in Complaint No.477 of 2017 of the Appellant.  Vide the impugned order, the State Commission has dismissed the Complaint of the Appellant.
2.      The brief facts of the case are that the Appellant (hereinafter called as “the Complainant”) took loan of ₹6,25,000/- from the Respondent on 24.03.2014 by pledging ornaments weighing              399 gms. under two loan accounts.  His contention was that the duration of the loan was 12 months which was extendable to                    90 days after expiry of 12 months, in case the customer was unable to repay the loan amount within 12 months.  His contention was that due date of repayment was after 22.06.2015.  Due to financial difficulties, the Complainant was not in a position to discharge the loan and he wanted to renew the loan amount by paying the interest only and when he was in the process of paying the interest, on 22.05.2015, the Respondent had insisted upon him to pay the balance amount of ₹1,25,000/- and also the interest accrued on it.  He was also told by the Respondent telephonically that since the market value of the gold had fallen down, he was immediately required to pay the balance loan amount.  His request for extension of time was turned down.  The Respondent thereafter scheduled an auction for his jewellery on 09.06.2015 giving an option to the Complainant to repay the loan before that date.  In order to avoid auction of his jewellery, the Complainant arranged the balance amount and repaid it on 16.06.2015 and his jewellery was released to him on 17.06.2015.  On these facts, the Complainant has alleged the deficiency in service on the part of the Respondent.  He has alleged that non-extension of the time beyond 12 months and non-communicating anything to him in writing, amounts to deficiency in service and has sought compensation of ₹97,70,750/- under different heads.
3.      The Respondent, however, did not submit any defence, although they had entered appearance.  The Complainant filed documents Annexures C-1 to C-10 before the State Commission and also furnished his affidavit in evidence.
4.      After hearing the parties and perusing the evidence on record, the State Commission has held as under:
“6.  Admittedly, the complainant had availed jewel loan on 24.03.2014 from the OP bank by pledging jewels and duration for repayment of loan was 12 months.  Though he has mentioned that the said documents are marked as NO.1 and 1A, for extended period of 90 days he has failed to file any such documents, in the circumstances, even according to the complainant the time for repayment is only for 12 months in which event the same expired on 23.03.2015.  The question of payment of differential value of ₹1,25,000/- arises only for renewal of the loan is considered.  In as much as in case complainant intended to renew the loan as on the said date of renewal, considering the value of the gold he was only entitled for ₹5.00 lakhs and as such the OPs demanding to remit the differential amount of ₹1,25,000/- cannot be said to be improper.  In the circumstances, bringing jewels on auction cannot be said to be illegal.  More so due procedure is followed by issuing notice to the complainant regarding the said date of auction of jewels.  In the circumstances, the contention of the complainant that there is deficiency in service by the OP bank cannot be accepted.
7.    Further it is seen that the complainant has discharged the loan before auction and got released the jewels and thus, there is no deficiency committed by the OP bank so as to entitle the complainant to seek damages for the alleged laches on the part of the OP.  Thus, the complaint is liable to be dismissed.  Hence, the following:
ORDER
","The above complaint is dismissed.
5.      These findings are challenged by the Complainant by way of this Appeal alleging that the State Commission has wrongly held that the Complainant had not produced any document to show that he had the grace period of 90 days over 12 months to repay the loan.  For this purpose, he has relied on letter dated 06.08.2015 written to him by the Respondent.  The relevant paragraph on which he has relied is reproduced as under:
6.      This document in no way helps the Complainant.  This document is written by the Respondent after everything was settled between the parties and again this does not relate to the loan taken by the Complainant from the Respondent.  It is an information given by the Respondent about the procedure of declaration of account as NPA.  This paragraph does not in any way shows that the borrower had the grace period of 90 days over 12 months for the repayment of the loan amount.  Rather, the paragraph before the above-mentioned paragraph in this document on which the Complainant has relied, clarifies that the borrower had to repay the loan amount within the stipulated period.  It also shows that every borrower had been issued a card at the time of sanction of loan showing all the details.  Relevant paragraph is reproduced as hereunder:
“In our bank all the limits against pledge of gold ornaments are sanctioned per certain period and before expiry of such period, borrowers has repay to the entire dues along with occurred interest.Our branches are informing the same at the time of availing limit itself and also putting the due date stamp on the card given to customers.Hence sudden demand for difference margin a mount doesn’t arise.
7.      The content of this document, relied upon by the Appellant/Complainant clearly shows that when the Complainant had taken the loan he had been issued a card and this card has to be in his possession.  The Complainant has not produced on record this card.  An adverse inference can certainly be drawn against him for the simple reason that had this card been shown by him, it would have gone against him.  No evidence on record is brought to my notice which could suggest that the Complainant had three more months over 12 months’ time to repay his loan.  He had to repay the loan within the period of 12 months and since he did not pay, the Respondent followed the procedure.  As soon as the loan was repaid, his loan account was settled and his pledged jewellery was released to him.  The Complainant has failed to point out any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.  There is                  no merit in the Appeal.  The Appeal is dismissed in limine with no order as to costs.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Ajay Singh, Advocate. 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      The complainant/appellant was awarded works by Hooghly Zila Parishad for construction of a road from Chhatarsal Bazar to 24 Purbazar and Muchigata to Nadippur.  Two different works were awarded to the complainant/appellant for constructing two different portions of the road.  The appellant/complainant was also required to maintain the road so constructed by it for a period of five years.  The complainant/appellant obtained two separate policies from the respondent in respect of the afore-said works entrusted to him by the Hooghly Zila Parisahd.
2.      The road constructed by the complainant/appellant got damaged on account of floods during August-September, 2007 and the case of the complainant is that the road got damaged, due to heavy rains and floods, was repaired by him at his own costs.  The claims for reimbursement in terms of the insurance policy taken by him were submitted by the complainant to the insurer.  A surveyor was appointed to assess the loss alleged to have been sustained by the complainant.  Vide his report dated 10.03.2018 Partha Choudhary who was the surveyor appointed by the insurer assessed the loss to the complainant at Rs.462428/- in respect of one portion of the damaged road and Rs. 2359778/- in respect of another portion of the damaged road.  The first report is dated 10.03.2008 and the other report is dated 15.03.2008.  The claim, however, was repudiated by the insurer vide its letter dated 13.03.2009 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
“The contract of insurance is based on utmost good faith and every fact of materiality and all material facts must be disclosed at the time of obtaining insurance cover. On happening of loss you are under policy condition liable to furnish required documents/papers as may be reasonably required by the Company. It has been observed that by not furnishing the 'Contract Data', copy of Contract separately, if any, for maintenance contract, concealment of the material fact has been done. Likewise in the Proposal Form you have declared that there is no river/nullah/drain or water body near the insured 'property' and there was no flood /inundation since last five years. Your kind attention is drawn to your own statement in the Claim Form where main reason for flood has been given by you is release of water from two number of dams, the surveyor's report corroborated the same.
On examination of the available papers with us, we can say that you did not have insurable interest in terms of Clause 11.1, 12.1 And 13.3. The insured may be interested in the property as owners, lessor, lessee, mortgagee, mortgager, vendor, purchaser, trustees etc. You were obliged to provide in terms of Clause 13.3 the insurance cover in the joint names of yourselves and your Employer from the date of completion to the end for defect liability period in the amounts and deductibles staled in the 'Contract Data' for the following events. Further this clause binds you to forward insurance policies and certificate to your employer for his/her approval.
The property is not owned by you nor you possess in any of the capacity mentioned above.
The Surveyor has in his reply vide his letter dated 13th September 2008 to the then Divisional Manager has said that accepting liability is the discretion of the insurer. Where insurable interest is not there, the surveyor can make the assessment of loss but the same is 'Without Prejudice'
Your kind attention is also drawn to the surveyor's Report in which he has stated that the loss of or damage to the 'Road' was caused by flood due to extremely heavy and continuous rainfall measuring 400 mm per day in average during July. August, 2007 onwards. The above statement shows that condition of the road must have already been in a deplorable condition in July, August 2007 itself. .In this respect we needed to know the date of completion of the road duly certified by the concerned authority and the starting date of the maintenance cover for defect liability period. The insurance cover was obtained by you on and from 22.08.2007 during the peak period of rainy season and date of the captioned loss is 25.9.2007. In this respect we sought a clarification from the surveyor by our Registered Letter dated 27th February 2009. The surveyor received the letter on 4th  March 2009 which he confirmed verbally over phone but as said by him he is unable to reply before May 2009.
You neither submitted the required papers/information nor you interacted with the concerned authority for good number of months which would have facilitated in disposing off your claim much earlier. Instead Suddenly and abruptly after 9-10 months you started putting pressure on newly joined Division In-charge for settling the claim. Reference of your letter dated i 6.2.2009 may be taken in this regard by which you chose to hold Division in-charge personally responsible for liability of interest that may entail due to delay in settlement of claim. Such personal attack is unwarranted and uncalled for. Your Bid Document dated 3rd August 2005 was accepted by your Employer vide his letter dated 25th November 2005 for execution of work of 'Road' construction and Defect Maintenance for five years of the work. You were responsible for 'defect liability' and were specifically exempted from a loss caused by natural calamities among other risks for maintenance period under Clause 13.3 side by side during execution period under Clause 11.1 & 12.1 of the Bid Document.
As per Clause 11.1 & 12.1 and 13.3 embodied in Bid Document dated 3'""'' August 2005 read together, the contractor will not be responsible for any loss or damage to the work ‘Road' arising from act of Natural Calamities among other risks mentioned in the clauses for which you have been specifically exempted from responsibility.
Since the actual case of loss is not in consistence with liability to your employer, we regret to inform that your reported claim is not payable and as such the claim is  repudiated by the competent authority.”
3.      It would thus be seen that the claims were repudiated on the following grounds:-
(1)     As per the terms of the contract executed between the complainant and the  Hooghly Zila Parishad the insurance policy was required to be taken in the joint names of the complainant and the Corporation but it was taken in the sole name of the complainant.
(2)     While taking the insurance policy the complainant had concealed a material fact that there was a river nearby the site where the work was to be executed by him.
(3)     As per the bid documents the complainant was not responsible for any loss or damage whatsoever arising out of the natural calamities.
(4)     The complainant did not have an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance
4.      Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of two separate consumer complaints.  The complaints were resisted by the insurer primarily on the grounds on which the claims had been repudiated.
","5.      The State Commission having dismissed the consumer complaints the complainant is before this Commission by way of these two separate appeals.
6.      Though it is alleged in the repudiation letter that there was a river nearby and it is also evident from the case of the complainant that it was the water released from the dam which had damaged the road, there is no evidence of the existence of any river near the site where the work was executed by the complainant.  There is a reference to the survey report in the repudiation letter but the Ld. Counsel for the insurer has not been able to draw my attention to any part of the survey report stating therein that a river existed near the site where the work was executed by the complainant.  Therefore, it would be difficult to accept that the complainant had concealed a material fact in the proposal form by declaring that no river/nullah/drain/water body existed near the insured property.  It is also stated in the repudiation letter that in the proposal form the complainant had declared that there was no flood/inundation in last 5 years.  But there is no evidence of any actual floor or inundation in five years before the proposal was submitted to the insurer.
7.      The Ld. Counsel for the insurer submits that the complainant had deleted storm/tempest/flood/inundation (STFI) in clause 11 of the proposal form.  However, this is not one of the grounds given by the insurer for the repudiation of the claim.  In view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Galada Power and Telecommunication Limited Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. & Anr. (2016) 14 SCC 161,  the insurer cannot be allowed to travel beyond the ground given in the repudiation letter.  Since the insurer did not reject the claim on the ground that flood and inundation were not one of the perils insured against, the submission made by the Ld. Counsel for the insurer cannot be considered.  In any case, the insurance policy indicates that it did not cover 5% of the claim arising out of any STFI, subsidence and landslide  meaning thereby that 95% of the loss arising of STFI was covered under the policy.  STFI was altogether not excluded while issuing the insurance policy.
8.      The case of the insurer, as noted earlier is that any damage to the work on account of natural calamities was to be suffered by the employer of the complainant i.e. Hooghly Zila Parishad and not by the complainant/insured.  A reference in this regard is made to clauses 11.1, 12.1 and 13.3 of the bid document dated 03.08.2005.   The bid document has nokt been filed either by the insurer or by the complainant but the Ld. Counsel for the complainant has drawn my attention to the letters dated  29.10.2007 and 25.03.2009 written by Hooghly Zila Parishad to the complainant.  The letter dated 29.10.2007 to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
“The above job was entrusted to you vide our memo No. 422 dt. 30/10/06 and you have completed the work as on 18.07.07 as per contract.
Please note that during the recent devastating flood the road was in submergence condition and thus it has got severely damaged which was intimated to you vide our Memo. No. 1032A dated 28/09/07. Now, as you have not yet taken up the repair work till date which you are liable as per agreement, I would once again request you to kindly do the needful for making good of the damaged road otherwise the Department may revoke the performance guarantee for realization of the cost for repair.  In such case the repairing will be done by engaging any other agency through tendering.”
9.      The letter dated 25.03.2009 to the extent it is material reads as under:-
“This is further to the letter No. 1032A dt. 28.09.07, I further state that you have made good all the damages after the devastating flood of 2007 as per the contract.
Now, as per contract data Insurance are to be done in the joint names with the Agency and the Employer which will be valid during execution of work only and the clause mentioned in the contract data has no impact except routine maintenance during defect liability period i.e. upto 5 years after the date of completion of work.
Under a situation like this I would request you to take up the routine maintenance work, if any, at the earliest.”
10.    It is evident from a perusal of these letters that the stand taken  by Hooghly Zila Parishad was that it was for the complainant to repair the damaged road.  Hooghly Zila Parishad had gone to the extent of threatening the complainant with revoking the performance guarantee for realizing the cost of repair in case the repairing work was not done by the complainant and another agency had to be engaged for the purpose.  It also appears from the letter dated 25.03.2009 that the damaged road had been repaired by the complainant to the satisfaction of Hooghly Zila Parishad.
11.    As noted earlier this is also the case of the insurer that the policy was required to be taken in the joint name of the complainant and his employer i.e. Hooghly Zila Parishad.  Had the policy been taken in the joint name of the complainant and Hooghly Zila Parishad and had the complainant not been responsible for repairing the damage caused to the road on account of a natural calamity such as flooding caused by release of excess water from the dam, the insurer would have been liable to reimburse Hooghly Zila Parishad for the expenses incurred in repair of the damaged road.  In another words, had the policy been taken in the joint name of the complainant and the Hooghly Zila Parishad the insurer would still have been liable to reimburse for the expenditure incurred in repair of the damaged road. The reimbursement would have been made to Hooghly Zila Parishad if the complainant was not required to repair the damaged road at his own cost and the cost would have been reimbursed to the complainant if he was required to repair the damaged road at his own cost.  Either way the insurer would have been liable as far as the cost of repairing the damage was concerned.  Therefore, it would make no difference as to whether the cost of repair was to be borne by the complainant or it was to be borne by Hooghly Zila Parishad.  For this very reason, the failure of the complainant  to join Hooghly Zila Parishad as a co-insured would be immaterial in the facts and circumstances of the case. It is not as if the insurance policy was to be taken in the sole name of the employer of the complainant.  The case of the insured is that the policy was to be taken in the joint name of the complainant and his employer Hooghly Zila Parishad.  Therefore, it would be difficult to say that the complainant did not have an insurable interest in the subject matter of the insurance.  This is more so, considering the stand taken by Hooghly Zila Parishad which required the complainant to repair the damaged road at his own cost and even went to the extent of threatening to recover the cost of repairs from the performance guarantee submitted by the complainant in case another agency had to be engaged by Hooghly Zila Parishad for repair of the damaged road.
12.    For the reasons stated hereinabove I am of the considered view that repudiation of the claims was not justified provided that the complainant is able to satisfy the insurer that the cost of repair was borne by him and not by Hooghly Zila Parishad.
13.    The impugned orders are, therefore, set aside and the consumer complaints are disposed of in terms of the following directions:-
(i)      The insurer shall verify from Hooghly Zila Parishad that the cost of repair of the roads which were subject matter of the claims filed by the complainant were borne entirely by the complainant and not by Hooghly Zila Parishad.
(ii)      If it is confirmed that the cost of repair of the roads were borne entirely by the complainant and not by Hooghly Zila Parishad the insurer shall pay an amount of Rs. 4,62,428/- in the CC No. 42 of 2009 subject matter of FA No. 398/2013 and an amount of Rs. 23,59,778/- in the CC No. 56 of 2009 subject matter of FA No. 399/2013 to the complainant/appellant, within three months from today along-with interest on that amount @ 8% p.a. w.e.f. the date of institution of the consumer complaint till the date of payment.  The first appeals stand disposed of.

  For the Complainant     :IN PERSON 
  For the Opp.Party      :
","PER MR PREM NARAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
The present consumer complaint has been filed by Venkatesh Kumar Jayakumr against the opposite party Federal Bank.
2.     Heard the complainant in person at the admission stage. Complainant has stated that he had applied for SME loan from the Bank on 18.07.2014 and the said loan was sanctioned after a delay of four months. It was argued that under the SME loan, the complainant was entitled to exemption for stamp duty, however, the Bank did not agree for the same for the project and the Bank refused to give the appraisal report, therefore, the complainant could not get the Central Government and State Government subsidies. This has resulted into bad financial condition of the complainant. Therefore, the complainant has filed the present complaint. It has been prayed in the complaint that on account of deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party Bank, the complainant be compensated for an amount of Rs.53,52,805/- along with 14.5% compound interest from 18.07.2015 till payment, in addition to a compensation of Rs.20 lakh.
3.     Complainant has further stated that there is a delay of 1580 days in filing the present complaint. Complainant has stated that an application for condonation of delay has been filed mentioning the circumstances under which the delay has happened. In fact, the complainant had approached the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) on 15.07.2017 where the application of the complainant was dismissed on 31.10.2017. The complainant then approached the Civil Court on 18.12.2017 however, the civil suit was dismissed on 11.12.2019. The father of the complainant had also filed a complaint case before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra on 11.03.2016 however the same was also dismissed on 15.01.2018. Being aggrieved, the complainant has preferred the present complaint against the opposite party. The complainant also mentioned that there was death in his family and therefore, he could not file the complaint in time. It was prayed that the delay in filing the complaint be condoned and the complaint be decided on merits.
4.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the complainant and have examined record. Though the complainant in his application for condonation of delay has requested only for condoning the delay of 725 days but the complainant has filled the proforma prescribed by the Registry of this Commission wherein the complainant has mentioned that there is a delay of 1580 days from the date of cause of action. From the complaint of the complainant also, it is brought out that the cause of action arose when the Bank did not give the appraisal letter to the complainant and allegedly the complainant could not get the subsidy from the Central as well as from the State Government and this was in the year 2014. In the application for condonation of delay, the following main points are mentioned by the complainant:
Complainant filed an application before DRT on 15.07.2016 well before the limitation as per section 17 (1) of the Sarfasei Act 2002. The said application was dismissed on 31.10.2017;
The application filed before the Civil Court Kalyan on 18th December 2017and this was also dismissed on account of Sarfasei Act 2002 on 11.12.2019 and till today the complainant has not received the copy of judgment of the suit no.330 of 2017;
The father of the complainant filed a complaint before the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on 11.03.2016, being no.CC/198 of 2016 which was dismissed for non-prosecution on 15.01.2018;
Complainant has stated that his mother was suffering from various life threatening diseases as mentioned below. She was constant under treatment from 29.01.2015 when she was admitted as she had gone into coma. But by god’s grace she came back to senses within ten days. But however, cause of her going in coma was not detected till 07.02.2015. She remained in Apex Hospital, Kalyan. She was suffering from Diabetes. Further Hip replacement was done in July 2012 and 2013 so she is handicapped and her movement is difficult.
Further, the bank was conducting recovery proceedings for which I had to attend the court had made remark that I should engage proper lawyer to defend the case. But it was impossible as I had no means of raising finance as my cibil records and that of my son was destroyed due to bank’s action. No humanitarian attitude was shown and bank refused to accept its error.
The complainant also attended to civil suit against the bank to get stay order to stop the bank from selling my properties. The suit was not heard properly and was delayed till August 2019 when suddenly in just 4 sitting the judge came to final argument and final judgment on December 11, 2019. Later on we came to know that the said judge was transferred in the same court but to another Bench so she had hurried up to complete the judgment which is questionable”.
5.     It is seen from the above that the complainant had already approached the different available forums for redressal of his grievances against the bank. The complainant had already approached the DRT on 15.07.2016 and his application was dismissed on 31.10.2017. The complainant then approached the Civil Court on 18.12.2017 and the suit was dismissed on 11.12.2019 due to proceeding under Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI). The complaint’s father had filed a consumer complaint before the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on 11.03.2016 which was also dismissed for non-prosecution on 15.01.2018. The appeal filed against this order was also withdrawn, therefore, the order of dismissal has become final.
6.     Though section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides alternative remedy but if a person has already availed the remedy under the relevant Act, he cannot again come to a consumer forum and seek redressal of the same grievances for which he had earlier gone under the relevant Act.  We are taking this view on the basis of the decision of this Commission in case of M/s Manas Constructions vs L & T Finance Ltd., and Anr., decided on 10th October 2017 in FA no. 1621 of 2016, wherein the following has been observed:
I fully agree with the observation of the State Commission that the complainant cannot proceed under two Acts for the same grievance. It is true that Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act envisages proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act as an additional remedy but it is clear that a person cannot proceed under two legal authorities under two different Acts for the same relief. Both the judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant seem to be inapplicable in the circumstances of the present case, as in those judgments, the arbitration proceedings, was not initiated whereas in the present case, the complaint has been filed during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings. Both the  referred judgments only provide that in spite of the arbitration clause in the agreement, the proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 are maintainable.  As the proceedings under Arbitration Act are already going on, the proceedings under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 cannot proceed simultaneously. This Commission has already decided this issue in number of judgments as mentioned below:
(i)   M/S. Magma Fincorp Ltd Vs Gulzar Ali, RP 3835 of 2013 decided on 17.04.2015,this Commission held as follows:-
“It is well settled that terms and conditions of the agreement to this effect do not bar jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora but when the parties opt to proceed, first of all, before the Arbitrator, in that event, the jurisdiction of this Commission stand barred”.
(ii)   Similar view has been taken by this Commission in the following other cases:
7.     From the complaint and from the application for condonation of delay, it is clear that the Bank has already taken the possession of the house of the complainant under the SARFAESI Act and the suit for restraining the Bank from selling this house has also been decided. Once the proceedings under the SARFAESI Act have been started, this Commission does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint against the Bank as observed by this Commission in RP no.4196 of 2014 – Chief Manager, Bank of Baroda vs Prabir Chaki and Anr., decided on 20th July 2015 (NC) as under:
This is a case where the account of the Respondents/ complainants Mr. Prabir Chaki and his wife Mrs. Suparna Chaki, was declared N.P.A. in accordance with the guidelines of the R.B.I. and the notice was issued under the SARFAESI Act on 10.11.2006.  This is well settled that the Consumer Fora have got no jurisdiction wherever the SARFAESI Act is applicable.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court while affirming the observation of this Commission in case of “Yashwant G. Ghaisas & Ors. Versus Bank of Maharashtra” in Civil Appeal No. 1359 of 2013 decided on 01.03.2013, was pleased to hold:-
","“The appellants challenged the action of the bank by filing a complaint under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short, the 1986 Act).  The National Commission referred to Section 34 of the 2002 Act whereby jurisdiction of all Courts and authorities to entertain challenge to the action taken by the bank has been ousted and dismissed the complaint by recording the following observations:
“19.   The National Commission is not empowered to arrogate to itself the powers which come within the jurisdiction of debt recovery tribunals.  This matter is purely covered within the jurisdiction of DRT or DRAT.  If there is any grievance against the notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act that should be brought to the notice of the concerned authority.  It is well settled that main creditor and the guarantors are equally responsible.  There lies no rub for the bank to take action against the guarantor directly.  It cannot be alleged that he is adopting the policy of pick and choose.  From the allegations stated above, there appears to be no deficiency on the part of the opposite party.  In case the bankers are working within the ambit of SARFAESI Act, it cannot be said to be deficiency on the part of the bank.  It must be established that there is deficiency on the part of the bank.  In that case this commission can take action. For the reasons stated, the complaint is dismissed at the stage of its admission. Nothing will preclude the complainants from approaching appropriate forum as per Law.”
(reported from the SLP paper book)”
8.     Thus, we find that the complaint filed by the complainant cannot be admitted on three counts. The first is that the complaint is highly time barred as the cause of action arose in the year 2014 and the complaint has been filed on 17.02.2020. From the application for condonation of delay, it is also clear that the DRT rejected application of the complainant on 31.10.2017, and the civil court dismissed the suit on 11.12.2019 whereas the State Commission also dismissed the complaint filed by the father of the complainant on 15.01.2018. It is not the case of the complainant that he approached the wrong forums for the remedy of his grievances as in that case, the time taken in other forums could have been condoned under section 14 of the Limitation Act. After dismissal of his complaints filed before the DRT and the State Commission as well as the Civil Suit, the complainant is searching another forum for redressal of his grievances. Thus, such a huge delay cannot be condoned.
9.     Another reason for not admitting the complaint is that the complainant has already availed the other legal provisions available for redressal of his grievances and when he did not succeed there, he is trying to avail the benefit of section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. In this regard, we rely on the decision of this Commission in M/s Manas Constructions vs L & T Finance Ltd., and Anr., (Supra). Moreover, when the matter has been decided by the Civil Court, decision of the Civil Court between the parties will operate as res judicata for the present complaint.
10.   The third reason for not accepting the present complaint is that the complaint is not maintainable before this Commission as the complainant has already availed the remedy by approaching the DRT and as the opposite party has already resorted to action against the complainant under the SARFAESI Act and as held by this Commission in Chief Manager, Bank of Baroda vs Prabir Chaki and Anr  (Supra) that this Commission does not have jurisdiction to entertain the complaint on the same set of facts for similar reliefs against the opposite party.
11.   Based on the above discussion, we are of the view that the present complaint cannot be admitted. Accordingly, CC no. 251 of 2020 is dismissed in limine.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K. AGRAWAL,PRESIDENT HON'BLE DR. S.M. KANTIKAR,MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Milan Negi, Advocate


                                                Mr. Ashu Kansal, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","For the purpose of computation of the cases filed before the National Commission, the Office is directed to register the case as First Appeal and number it accordingly.
These First Appeals, under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2019 Act”), has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. through its Resolution Professional against the Order dated 13th March, 2020, passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi at New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in Complaint Cases No. 286, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306 & 307 of 2017, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants.  The State Commission by the Impugned Order has allowed the Complaints, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants, and directed M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) to refund the entire amount received from the Complainants, including service tax alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date on which entire amount alongwith compensation is refunded, with a further direction to pay ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation to each of the Complainants.  The payment was directed to be made within three months from receipt of copy of the Order.
An Application has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) for exemption from pre-deposit of the amount, as provided under Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, which has come into force w.e.f. 20th/24th July, 2020.
The learned Counsel appearing for M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) submitted that the Appellant is not in a position to deposit the amount as contemplated under the Second Proviso to Section 51(1) of the 2019 Act. The learned Counsel further submitted that under Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act an Appeal lies to the National Commission from an Order passed in Appeal by the State Commission, where there is no requirement of pre-deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission, whereas under the Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act the Appellant is required to deposit fifty  percent of the amount in terms of the Order passed by the State Commission before the National Commission so that the National Commission may entertain the Appeal.  A harmonious construction of the various provisions of Section 51 of the 2019 Act has to be made and, if that is done, then the necessary corollary is that the deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission for entertaining the appeal is not mandatory but only directory in nature.
The learned Counsel also referred to and relied upon a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors., reported in (2014) 8 SCC 657, and submitted that it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay.
We have heard the learned Counsel for the M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) and have considered the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel.
Before adverting to the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, we deem it appropriate for ready reference to reproduce Section 51 of the 2019 Act:
“51. (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 47 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the National Commission shall not entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of  thirty days unless it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the National Commission from any order passed in appeal by any State Commission, if the National Commission is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
(3) In an appeal involving a question of law, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.
(4) Where the National Commission is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question and hear the appeal on that question:
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the National Commission to hear, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question of law.
(5) An appeal may lie to the National Commission under this section from an order passed ex parte by the State Commission.”
From a perusal of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, we find that under Sub Section (1) a right of Appeal  has been given to any person who is aggrieved by the Order passed by the State Commission in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47. Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47 deals with the powers of the State Commission to entertain Complaints only. The Appeal has to be filed within a period of thirty days of such Order. However, the First Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 gives the discretion to the National Commission to entertain the Appeal even after the period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period meaning that it has the power to condone the delay in filing the Appeal beyond thirty days. The Second Proviso to sub Section (1) of Section 51 provides  that the Appeal shall not be entertained by the National Commission of the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of the Order of the State Commission unless fifty percent of that amount has been deposited.
Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act provides a second Appeal to be preferred before the National Commission in an order passed by the State Commission in Appeal.  However, the second Appeal should involve a substantial question of law. Sub Section 3 to 5 of Section 51 are not being referred to as they are not relevant for deciding the issue involved in these cases.
In our considered opinion the intention of the Parliament while enacting 2019 Act is that if the Complaint has been decided by any one forum then the person who has been directed to pay certain amount should deposit fifty percent of that amount if a first Appeal is being filed before the next forum.  The provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 deals with the First Appeal being filed before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in the Complaint Case and, therefore, there is a requirement of deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.
We may mention here that similar provision has been made by the Parliament in Section 41 of the 2019 Act, which provides for preferring an appeal against an order passed by the District Forum before the State Commission.  For ready reference, Section 41 is reproduced below:
“41. Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Commission may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty-five days from the date of the order, in such form and manner, as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of forty-five days, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed:
Provided also that no appeal shall lie from any order passed under sub-section (1) of section 81 by the District Commission pursuant to a settlement by mediation under section 80.”
Likewise, under Section 67 of the 2019 Act, a provision has been made for filing an Appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against an order passed by the National Commission under Sub-Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 58, which deals with the orders passed in the Complaint Cases.  The Second Proviso of Section 67 also requires deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the National Commission before the Appeal can be entertained by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  For ready reference, Section 67 of the 2019 Act is reproduced below:
“67. Any person, aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 58, may prefer an appeal against such order to the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of the order:
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless that person has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.”
From a reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is absolutely clear that the Parliament wanted to make it mandatory for the Opposite Party in the Complaint Case to deposit a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded by the Consumer Fora/Commissions while preferring First Appeal.
So far as the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors. (Supra), relied upon by the learned Counsel, is concerned, we may mention here that in Paragraph-11 and 12 of the said decision, the Apex Court has held that unless the Appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the Appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission.  Paragraphs 11 and 12are reproduced below for ready reference:
“11. The second proviso to Section 19 of the Act mandates pre-deposit for consideration of an appeal before the National Commission. It requires 50% of the amount in terms of an order of the State Commission or 35,000/- whichever is less for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission. Unless the appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission. A pre-deposit condition to deposit 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission or Rs.35,000/- being condition precedent for entertaining appeal, it has no nexus with the order of stay, as such an order may or may not be passed by the National Commission. Condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals.
(Underlined by us)
12. It is not the case of any of the appellants that the Consumer Forum including State and National Commissions has no power to pass interim order of stay. If the National Commission after hearing the appeal of the parties in its discretion wants to stay the amount awarded, it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay. Entertainment of an appeal and stay of proceeding pursuant to order impugned in the appeal stands at different footings, at two different stages. One (pre-deposit) has no nexus with merit of the appeal and the other (grant of stay) depends on prima facie case; balance of convenience and irreparable loss of party seeking such stay.”
(Underlined by us)
Thus, the condition for pre-deposit of 50% awarded by the State Commission in Complaint Case in an Appeal preferred before the National Commission is mandatory. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Shreenath Corp. & Others (Supra) in paragraph 11 reproduced above condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals. This Commission cannot entertain any Appeal unless the concerned Appellant has deposited 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.  There is no provision in the 2019 Act, empowering the National Commission to waive, relax or reduce the amount to be deposited under the Second Proviso, referred to above.  The present First Appeals are, therefore, defective for want of pre-deposit of the fifty percent of the amount directed by the State Commission in the impugned Order, which has not been made by the Appellant.
","          Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.     
Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.

Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, with Mr.Alabhya Dhamija, Advocates 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      These appeals are directed against the order of the State Commission whereby the consumer complaints filed by the Appellants were disposed of with directions to the Respondent to deliver possession execute the sale deed in favour of the Complainants/ Appellants and pay compensation in terms of the said order to them.  While deciding the complaint the State Commission rejected the challenge by the Complainants to the additional demand raised by the Respondent on account of increase in the saleable area of the flats which the Complainants had booked with the Respondents.
2.      The Ld.Counsel for the Appellants/ Complainants states on instructions that in these appeals they are restricting their grievance to the alleged increase in the saleable area of the apartment. His submission is that the additional demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area of the apartment was made by the developer without providing requisite certificates evidencing the alleged increased in the saleable area of the apartment.  The Ld. Counsel for the Respondent submits that as per the agreements executed between the parties the saleable area of the independent floor for the purpose of the calculating the sale price of the independent floor subject matter of the agreement is the sum of the specific area of the said independent floor and its pro-rata interest in the common areas in the said building/ plot. The relevant clause in the agreement reads as under:
“Saleable Area for the purpose of calculating the sale price of Said Independent Floor, shall be the sum of the Specific Area of Said Independent Floor and its prorate interest in the Common areas in Said Building/ said plot.
Whereas the specific area of Said Independent Floor shall mean entire area enclosed by its periphery walls including area under walls, columns, verandahs/ balconies, cupboards and lofts etc. and half the area of common walls with adjoining Independent Floor which form integral part of Said Independent Floor and Common areas shall mean all such parts/ areas in Said Building which the Allottee of Said Independent Floor shall use by sharing with the other allottees/ occupants in Said Building/ said plot including entrance at ground floor, plumbing shafts, electrical shafts, lift shaft, if provided, staircase including area used for electric meter boxes, letter boxes & call bells, mumty, overhead water tanks and architectural features if provided.
It if further clarified that the Saleable Area mentioned in the Agreement is tentative and may undergo changes, the final Saleable Area shall be intimated upon completion of construction of the said building. Inclusion of common areas within or outside the said building for the purpose of calculating Saleable Area does not give any right, title or interest in common areas to the allottee except the right to use Common areas by sharing with the other allottees/ occupants in Said Building/ said plot.  The tentative percentage of specific area of Said Independent Floor to saleable area varies 87% to 92% approximately presently, depending on the size of the independent floor, which may under changes till completion of construction of the said building.”
The specific area of the independent floor thus has been defined in the agreement and so has been the common area in the said building/ plot.
3.      The Ld. Counsel for the developer also submits that the saleable area of each independent floor was got independently verified by the respondent from School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi and the final saleable area so determined by the School of Planning and Architecture is absolutely inconformity with the final super area of the independent floor conveyed by them to the allottees. It is also pointed out by the Ld. Counsel for the respondent that though the Complainants expressed grievance in respect to the increasing in the saleable area in most of the Consumer Complaints filed by them, in some of the matters no prayer in respect of the saleable area was made by them. It is pointed out by the Ld.Counsel for the Appellants that the directions for withdrawal of the additional demand which included the demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area was sought by the concerned Complainants in most of these matters.
4.      It was suggested to the Complainants/ Appellants that in order to give a quietus to the dispute, the report of School of Planning and Architecture can be taken on record and the Appellants can be given opportunity to file evidence in rebuttal, before this Commission itself.  But, the Ld. Counsel for the Appellants wants determination by the State Commission, on the basis of the evidence of both the parties.
","5.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of in terms of the following directions.
The matters are remitted back to the concerned State Commission for deciding whether there has been any increase in the saleable area of the independent floors allotted to the Complainants/ Appellants or not and if so to what extent the said saleable area has increased.
The Respondent shall be entitled to lead evidence in addition to the report of the School of Planning and Architecture if it so wants, to prove the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor.
The Appellants/ Complainants shall be entitled to lead evidence to prove that there has been no increase in the saleable area or that the increase was less than for which they were made to pay to the Respondent.
The State Commission shall pass fresh order limited to the grievance of the Complainants/ Appellants with respect to the additional demand due to the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor after giving opportunity to the parties to lead evidence in terms of this order.
The final order with respect to the grievance of the Complainants against additional demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor shall be passed by the State Commission at the earliest possible.
While passing appropriate fresh orders the State Commission shall, inter alia, consider the prayers made in the Consumer Complaints.
No order as to costs.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. C. VISWANATH,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Ms. Sumita Roy Chowdhury, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Atanu Chakrabotry, Advocate 
","1.       The present Appeal is filed by the Appellants under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against order passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No. 161/2016 dated 21.09.2016 whereby the Complaint filed by the Appellants/Complainants was dismissed on the ground of limitation.
2.       Alongwith the appeal, IA/11215/2016, an application for condonation of delay of 18 days has been filed by the appellants. For the reasons stated in the application, delay is condoned.
3.       Heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellants as well as Respondents and also carefully gone through the record.
4.       The case of the Appellants/Complainants is that the cause of action arose on 06.05.2013 when the Opposite Party cancelled the agreement for sale dated 24.04.2011 relating to flat No.F-3 and subsequently on 05.09.2013 when the Opposite Party issued letter demanding extra payment for flat No.4 relating to agreement dated 27.04.2011. The Consumer Complaint was filed before the State Commission on 19.04.2016 after expiry of the limitation period, with a delay of 228 days. The ground taken by the Complainants for condonation of delay before the State Commission was that the delay had occurred because the Complainant had filed a complaint case before the State Commission for getting legal aid. It was further submitted before the State Commission that the Complainant is a layman.
5.       The Opposite Party contested the case on the ground that the excuse of layman is not a sufficient ground for condonation of delay. It was further submitted that the Appellants/Complainants could not prove their diligence in filing the case within the period of limitation. Respondent/Opposite Party also submitted that as per provisions of Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, limitation of time is mandatory in nature and such mandatory limit of time cannot be ignored on the ground of Appellants/Complainants being layman.
6.       The State Commission after hearing both the parties dismissed the Complaint on the ground of limitation. The State Commission observed as follows:-
“The expression ‘shall not admit a complaint’ as occurring in Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is a sort of Legislative Command to the Consumer Fora for not entertaining any Complaint which has been filed beyond the period of limitation if the delay in filing the case is not sufficiently explained.”
The aforesaid facts, evidence on record and submissions clearly indicate that the reasonable hence, sufficient explanation has been advanced on behalf of the Complainants for condonation of the inordinate delay of 228 days.”
State Commission further observed: -
“In the result, the prayer for condonation of delay is rejected, the day to day delay having not been sufficiently explained, and the instant Complaint Case is dismissed, the same being barred by limitation as prescribed u/s 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”
7.       Against the order of the State Commission, present Appeal has been filed by the Appellants/Complainants.
8.       Heard learned Counsel for the Appellants as well as Respondent and carefully gone through the record. Section 24 A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 reads as follows: -
“(1) The District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission shall not admit a complaint unless it is filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), a complaint may be entertained after the period specified in sub-section (1), if the complainant satisfies the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, that he had sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within such period: Provided that no such complaint shall be entertained unless the National Commission, the State Commission or the District Forum, as the case may be, records its reasons for condoning such delay.”
9.       A reading of Section 24A of the Act makes it clear that the District Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission are not bound to admit each and every complaint. The power of condonation of delay is to be exercised after giving opportunity of hearing to the complainant, who can seek condonation of delay under Section 24A(2) by showing that there was sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within limitation period.
10.     Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Complainants submitted that the State Commission erred in passing in the impugned order, ignoring the fact that the Appellants are layman and did not have knowledge of Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It was further submitted that the Appellants have a good case on merit and the case needs to be adjudicated in the interest of justice.
","11.     As seen from the order of the State Commission, the Petitioner had not given sufficient grounds to condone the delay of 228 days beyond the period of limitation. The State Commission was satisfied that there was no sufficient cause for filing the complaint beyond the period of limitation. Therefore, the State Commission dismissed the Complaint.
12.     The Complainant entered into two agreements for sale for purchase of flats and cannot be said to be a poor consumer and seek legal aid. He has, in fact, booked two flats and entered into agreement for sale. He was not been able to sufficiently explain the reasons for delay beyond the period of limitation and could not satisfy the State Commission for filing the complaint beyond the period of limitation. Hon’ble Supreme Court in V.N. Shrikhande vs. Anita Sena Fernandes, Civil Appeal No.8983 of 2010 decided on 20.10.2010 held as under: -
“14. A reading of the above noted provisions makes it clear that the District Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission are not bound to admit each and every complaint. Under Section 12(3), the District Forum is empowered to decide the issue of admissibility of the complaint. The District Forum can either allow the complaint to be proceeded with, which implies that the complaint is admitted or reject the same. Similar power is vested with the State Commission under Section 18 and the  12National Commission under Section 22. If the concerned forum is prima facie satisfied that the complainant is a `consumer' as defined in Section 2(d) and there is a `defect', as defined in Section 2(f) in relation to any goods or there is `deficiency in service' as defined in Section 2(g) read with Section 2(o) and the complaint has been filed within the prescribed period of limitation then it can direct that the complaint may be proceeded with. On the other hand, if the concerned forum is satisfied that the complaint does not disclose any grievance which can be redressed under the Act then it can reject the complaint at the threshold after recording reasons for doing so. Section 24A(1) contains a negative legislative mandate against admission of a complaint which has been filed after 2 years from the date of accrual of cause of action. In other words, the consumer forums do not have the jurisdiction to entertain a complaint if the same is not filed within 2 years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen. This power is required to be exercised after giving opportunity of hearing to the complainant, who can seek condonation of delay under Section 24A(2) by showing that there was sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within the period prescribed under Section 24A(1). If the complaint is per se barred by time and the complainant does not seek condonation of delay under Section 24A(2), the consumer forums will have no option but to dismiss the same.”
13.     In view of the above, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the impugned order passed by the State Commission warranting interference in exercise of appellate jurisdiction under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to cost.

  For the Respondent      :NEMO 
","PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      The present Revision Petition is against the order dated 09.11.2017 of the Tripura State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Agartala (for short the “State Commission”) whereby the appeal against the order of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, West Tripura, Agartala was dismissed.
2.      To bring clarity, we refer the parties with the positions assigned to them in the complaint. Smt. Mampi Dhar (Ghosh) being the complainant; Tata AIG Life Insurance Co. Ltd. being the OP 1- Ins. Co. and Smt. Anjali Ghosh being the OP- 2.
3.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the case are that one Mr. Bipul Kanti Ghosh had purchased an insurance policy (Policy No. U201069468) on 17.02.2011 from the OP- 1 Ins. Co. The value of the policy was Rs. 3,50,000/- and its time period was for 20 years. During the subsistence of the policy, the life assured, DLA died on 29.12.2011. The nominee Anjali Ghosh, mother of DLA filed death claim on 02.05.2012. Similarly on the same date, the DLA’s wife Mrs. Mampi Dhar sent letter to the insurance co. and requested not to release the claim payout in favour of the nominee Anjali Ghosh (mother). Thereafter, Mampi Dhar obtained a succession certificate on the strength of Order of Civil Judge, Sr. Division, West Tripura, Agartala and thereafter, she filed a claim of the insured amount from the insurance co. (OP-1) but the insurance co. did not pay the insurance amount, therefore, being aggrieved, she filed a complaint before the District Forum, West Tripura, Agartala. The nominee Anjali Ghosh i.e. the mother of DLA was proforma OP-2.
4.      The complaint was resisted by the OP 1- Ins. Co.  by filing a written statement.  It was contended that the complainant was not a consumer as the nominee of the policy in question was the mother of the DLA i.e Smt. Anjali Ghosh. Proforma OP- 2 i.e the mother of the complainant also filed a written statement and asserted that the petition be allowed and the OP 1 – Ins. Co. be directed to deposit 1/3rd of the amount as per law.
5.      After hearing the parties and appraisal of evidence, the District Forum vide order dated 19.01.2017  directed the OP 1-  Ins. Co. to pay the insured amount of Rs. 3,50,000/- to the nominee , Anjali Ghosh after deducting Rs. 31,259/- which was paid earlier to her. OP 2 to pay 1/3rd of Rs. 3,50,000/- to the complainant and 1/3rd to her grandson , Bipradip Ghosh or to his natural guardian in proof of minority.
","6.      Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the OP 1 -  Ins. Co. appealed to the State Commission. The Appeal was dismissed being devoid of merit.
7.      Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the OP 1 – Ins. Co. has approached this Commission through this Revision Petition.
8.      We have heard the learned counsel for the Ins. Co. and perused the material on record.
9.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the claim of the nominee i.e. Mrs. Anjali Gosh being an early claim the Insurance Company decided to get the matter investigated and by virtue of that investigation a Bed Head Ticket dated 29.12.2011 issued by Tripura Medical College & Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Memorial Teaching Hospital was procured which clearly reflected that the DLA was addicted to drugs and substance abuse for the last 15 years including polysubstance abuse viz. benzodiazepine and syrups since the last 5 years. He was also an alcoholic since the last 4 years and suffering from Diabetes Mellitus or DM for the last the 2 years which was much prior to the issuance of the said policy dated 17.02.2011. The amount of Rs. 31529 (unit value) was credited to the account of the nominee Mrs. Anjali Gosh vide National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT). The insurance company repudiated the claim of the nominee Mrs. Anjali Gosh vide repudiation letter dated 09.10.2012 as the Contract of Insurance stands null and void, since the same was fraudulently obtained after having concealed material facts and making false representations. Vide the aforesaid letter she was informed that the amount of Rs. 31259/- (unit value) was credited to her account vide NEFT on 04.10.2017.
10.    After thoughtful consideration, we note that both the fora below have not taken into account the policy’s terms and conditions. The medical record of Tripura medical college of the deceased clearly shows that he was drug abused for more than 15 years and alcoholic. He was diabetic also. It was concealed from the proposal form. We find it was a material concealment and the repudiation from insurance co. was justified. Thus, the claim of the nominee under the said policy i.e. Mrs. Anjali Ghosh, mother of the DLA already stood repudiated vide letter dated 09.10.2012 on the ground of material concealment and the unit value of Rs. 31,259 was also credited to her account. Hence the question of releasing the sum assured in favour of Mampi Dhar Ghosh does not arise as the contract of insurance stood cancelled.
11.    In a nutshell, the claim was investigated by the Ins. Co. since it was an early claim; cogent evidence of drug and substance abuse and of being addicted to alcohol and of suffering from diabetes mellitus was well forthcoming; the said abuse and addiction and disease were prior to the filling up of the proposal form; no mention of the same was made in the proposal form, though specifically asked for (‘No’ had been written against the relevant entries in the proposal form); as such, this was clear concealment of material facts. Hence the Ins. Co. cannot be faulted on repudiating the claim. Both the fora below have erred in overlooking the afore.
12.    Based on the above discussion, the Revision Petition is allowed. The impugned Order dated 09.11.2017 of the State Commission is set aside. The Complaint is dismissed.

2.      Vide the present revision petitions, the petitioner has challenged his liability to execute the sale deed.  It is submitted that the fora below has wrongly imposed the liability upon him to execute the sale deed.  It is submitted that the petitioner is not bound to execute the sale deed since the respondents no.1,2 & 3 who were his contractors, had sold the houses, which were constructed by them under the agreement dated 17.7.1987 in violation of terms and conditions of this agreement.  It is argued that in terms of the said agreement, as per condition no.2 the liability of the petitioner to execute the sale deeds would have arisen only if the respondent no.1,2 & 3 had sold the houses to the persons as per the list to be provided by him to the respondents.
3.      On enquiry, learned counsel for petitioner submits that she is not aware if any such list had ever been supplied by the petitioner to respondent no.1,2 & 3.
4.      I have given consideration to the arguments of learned counsel, the plea and contention of petitioner before this Commission is that allotments were not made by respondent no.1,2 & 3 as per the list which was required to be submitted by the petitioner to respondent no.1,2 & 3 and hence no liability can be fixed upon the petitioner and therefore the fora below have wrongly exercised their jurisdiction.  It is also argued that there is no privity of contract between the petitioner and the complainants.
5.      Learned counsel for respondent no.1,2 & 3 have argued that the respondents have sold the houses and accepted money for its construction under the scheme in terms of condition No.2 of the agreement dated 17.07.1987 and that there is no violation of any terms and conditions of this agreement.  It is further submitted that allotment has been made as per the list provided by the petitioner.  It is submitted that due to this conduct of the petitioner which is nothing less than blackmailing the respondent no.1,2 & 3, it is the complainants who has been suffering and despite them being in possession of the subject properties,  they do not have a covenant conferring title of the property on them.  It is submitted that the petitioners had submitted a list of allottees of the property under the scheme to the competent authority and the State Commission had perused the said order of the Competent authority and Additional Collector Office, Bahumali Building, Nanpura, Surat dated 30.06.1993   by which the petitioner was granted permission under Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, 1976 for constructing 28 houses of A type, 32 houses of B type and 18 houses of C type.  Thus permission was given to raise construction of total 78 houses and the houses were allotted to the complainants as per the said list.  It is argued that the argument of the petitioner is baseless.
6.      The learned counsel for respondent no.1 to 3 has produced the documents i.e the order dated 30.06.1993 containing names of complainants on which the State Commission has relied.
7.      This document, which forms part of the State Commission Order, has not been filed by the petitioner, alongwith the present revision petitions.  The copy is  thus taken on record since it is an important document and relied upon by State Commission in impugned order is placed in revision petition No.1371 of 2018.
8.      Learned counsel appearing on behalf of majority of complainants has submitted that it is the complainant who is suffering in fight of rights between petitioner and respondent no.1,2 & 3.
9.      I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of learned counsels and have perused the file.  The jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) is very limited.  Where there are concurrent findings on the facts, this Commission is debarred from re-appreciating and reassessing the evidences and substituting it with its own opinion.  Only when there is wrong exercise of jurisdiction or the order is perverse that this Commission can intervene.
10.    In the present case, it is argued by the petitioner that there was no privity of contract between them and the complainants and, therefore, the liability has been wrongly imposed upon them. The petitioner is owner of the property on which construction was raised.  Admittedly he applied for permission to construct 78 AWAS for the backward classes on his land under a scheme of the Government for consideration of AWAS for backward classes people.  He engaged respondent no.1,2 & 3 for constructing those houses while seeking  permission, petitioner had also submitted the list of the beneficiaries under the said scheme i.e. the list of the persons to whom houses would be allotted under the said scheme.  Admittedly while granting permission vide order dated 30.06.1993, the concerned authority duly approved the list of allottees.  Since petitioner was the owner and it is he who had raised the construction on his property and respondent no.1,2 & 3, according to him were engaged as contractors to raise construction, it is he with whom the complainants have privity of contract.  The name of the complainants appears on the list submitted by the petitioner to the concerned authorities, while seeking permission under the Scheme.  Respondent no.1,2 &3 have drawn my attention to the documents showing the receipts of the money, showing that the consideration money had been received by the petitioner from the complaints.  The petitioner has also intentionally concealed these documents and have not filed it with the present revision petition.  These documents clearly establishes that it is the petitioner who had received  the money i.e. sale price from the complainants. Having received the sale
price from complainants and petitioner being owner, his act of refusing to execute the sale deed amounts to gross deficiency in service.  The arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner that allotments were made to the persons in violation Clause 2 of the Agreement by the respondent No.1,2 & 3 also has no merit.  The findings of the State Commission is based on document executed by petitioner himself and which petitioner has not denied rather has intentionally concealed it.  It, therefore, cannot be said that State Commission had wrongly exercised its jurisdiction or its findings are perverse.
11.    The above mention conduct of the petitioner clearly shows that the petitioner although with a good intention raised the construction on his property of 78 houses for allotment to the people of backward classes and got the approval from the competent authority and in terms of that, possession was handed over to the complainants on and around the year 1997 yet for the last about 23 years, he has not executed the sale deed and had been contesting the matters on the ground which were false to his own knowledge and were meritless and he is also guilty of concealing material documents.
12.    Hence, while dismissing these revision petitions, I impose a cost of Rs.10,000/- upon the petitioner to be paid to each of the complainant in each Revision Petition by way of demand draft within four weeks.

7.     The Award made by the State Commission vide its Order of 09.12.2014 is as below:
11.     In view of aforesaid observations, we hold that complaint is based on substantive merit.  Therefore, complainant must succeed against opponents.  We hold accordingly and pass the following order:-
-: ORDER :-
1.       Complaint is allowed.
2.

On the Opposite Party No. 2 not accepting and issuing receipt for the said amount of Rs. 10 lakh, despite immediate and continuous attempts, the Complainant deposited the same with the State Commission on 04.04.2015 vide a Pay Order dated 31.03.2015. The Complainant was dutiful and diligent in complying with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award i.e. to pay / deposit the balance consideration of Rs. 10 lakh. The said deposit was made before the State Commission after some natural time was first taken in the continuous endeavours of the Complainant to pay the said amount and obtain receipt therefor from Opposite Party No. 2. The delay, if at all any, was unintentional, and, in all contingencies, reasonable, and, as such, acceptable.
9.     It is noted that, on the Opposite Parties not complying with sub-para 2 and sub-paras 4 to 7 of the directions contained in the Award, the Complainant filed E.A. No. 08 of 2018 in C.C. No. 304 of 2011 before the State Commission on 09.01.2018.

[a] the Complainant was dutiful and diligent in complying with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award made by the State Commission, the short delay of 71 days beyond the specific period stipulated by the State Commission is understandable, per se reasonable, does not materially or significantly affect the compliance; and
[b] no Appeal had been filed before this Commission by any of the Opposite Parties till the relevant date i.e. 09.01.2018 when the Complainant filed her E.A. No. 08 of 2018 before the State Commission (which was 1011 days after she had made the compliance of the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award).

12.   The execution proceedings, of trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986, had been initiated before the instant three F.A.s, No. 1136 of 2018, No. 1250 of 2018 and No. 1858 of 2019, were filed before this Commission on 20.06.2018, 12.07.2018 and 11.09.2019, respectively.
13.   Without entering into its merits, a perusal of the State Commission’s Order of 09.12.2014 shows that the Appellant in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018, who was the Opposite Party No. 2 before the State Commission, the Appellant in F.A. No. 1250 of 2018, who was the Opposite Party No. 3 before the State Commission, and the Appellant in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019, who was the Opposite Party No. 4 before the State Commission, had been duly served and were aware of the C.C. No. 304 of 2011.
14.   The stated reasons for delay, as contained in the respective applications for condonation of delay, are reproduced below for ready appreciation:
Application for condonation of delay in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018
I say that I have filed the present Condonation of delay Application against the Respondents as the Order passed by The Hon’ble State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra, Mumbai in Case No. CC/11/304 on 09.12.2014 was hand delivered to me on 03rd May 2018.
I say that within 30 days of the order received in hand I was required to file an Appeal as I was unaware because I had not received any information nor did I receive any legal support hence was delayed.
I am very much aggrieved by the said order hence require to Appeal. I was present in court to give my oral statement but the Hon’ble court did not allow me to give my say and proceeded with hearing and passed the impugned order.
I say that due to unforeseen circumstances and personal constraints I was unable to file an Appeal hence humbly pray the said delay be condoned and the Appeal be allowed.
I say that the condonation of delay application along with the Appeal is required to be heard urgently as a grave injustice and prejudice would be caused to the Appellant if the same is not heard and its also against the natural justice.
I repeat, reiterate, reaffirm and confirm the entire cause of action set out in the Condonation of delay Application and the Stay Application for the sake of brevity I pray that the same be treated as forming part of this Application.
The Appellant in the facts and circumstances aforesaid pray that:
(a)     the said condonation of delay application be allowed and the ___  days of delay be condoned with;
(b)     the said Appeal filed along with condonation of delay application be admitted and be heard;

(d)     Leave to add, amend and alter the grounds of this Application;
(e)     For such further and other reliefs as the nature and circumstances of the case may be granted in favour of the Appellant;

3.       That the appellant was not aware about the complaint filed before the Ld. State Commission as the appellant had shifted from the address mentioned in the complaint way back in 2007.
4.       That the appellant came to know about the present case only when he received the phone call from the local Police Station on 26.06.2018 intimating him about arrest warrant issued by the Ld. State Commission. That the appellant appeared before the Ld. State Commission on 09.07.2018 along with his Advocate but the Ld.

5.       That the delay caused in filing the appeal is neither deliberate nor want on and same was beyond the knowledge and control of the appellant.

Application for condonation of delay in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019
2.       That the humble applicant was working partners in respondent firm and therefore, he was retired from the firm said firm by executing the deeds which is annexed in the Appeal Memo.  Thereafter by executing the Indemnity Bond the then existing partner of the firm has taken all the liability of the subject transition in appeal memo particularly of Smt. Kamal Dattatray Kale the Respondent No. 1 herein and has assured and undertaken to keep me indemnified from all claims and losses.  The applicant had brought the said documents on record before the Trial Court and after receiving the indemnity bond and assurances from respondent No. 2 to 5 has stop attending the aforesaid matter.
3.       That applicant was assured by the Respondent No. 2 to 5 and they had taken all liability vide Indemnity Bond dated 5th July 2012 they had requested me that they and firm will take care of the Respondent No. 1 and its claim as such applicant had stopped attending the matter before the Trial Court. The applicant has learned that the Respondent No. 2 to 5 have invited the said impugned order by not attending the subject case before the Trial Court and when in execution proceedings he was taken in to custody by the police authority on he came to know about the said impugned order in the year 2018 only. That applicant is a senior Citizen and has taken all due care and diligence till he was assured by the Respondent No. 2 to 5.
4.       It is respectfully submitted that applicant was served with the appeal memo of the appeal preferred by the Respondent No. 2 to 4.  Thereafter applicant had filed my written statement/reply to the said case and had brought the said true and correct facts before this Hon’ble Court and has supported the prayer of quashing or set aside the impugned order/judgment. The applicant has even filed application before the Trial Court and attending the day to day hearing in execution proceedings and when applicant meets his new advocate in the month of August he has advised him to file proper appeal before this Hon’ble Tribunal to seek justice. The applicant was not aware that despite filling reply and protesting the impugned order under the law and he needs to file Appeal Memo to challenge the same.
5.       It is respectfully submitted that delay in filing the instant appeal was not deliberate or intentional but has occurred due to the reasons mentioned above. It is further submitted that the applicant has been in continues in touch with the Respondents who were fully aware of the said facts despite they have not pointed out to the court true and correct facts and have invited the impugned order against the Appellant despite facts that they had taken over all liability of the appellant and has specifically agreed to settle the issue/liability in relation with the Respondent No. 1.
6.       That the applicant has received a letter impugned order dated 12.12.2014 on 1st week of July, 2018 the time to file appeal was till 1st August, 2018. I am filling the Appeal on ______ and such there is delay of ______ days.
7.       That delay as caused in the filing complaint not is bona fide or deliberate rather delay is caused due to false assurance given by the Respondent. That there is sufficient grounds to condone the delay and admit the First Appeal. The applicant was prevented by sufficient reasons by which he was prevented from filing of Complaint. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, it is just and proper that the Honourable Court be pleased to condone the delay of _____ days in filing the present appeal.
8.       That no prejudice of whatsoever nature will be caused to the Respondent if the delay in filing the complaint is condone. The Applicant states that on the contrary if delay is not condoned serious hardship will be caused to the Applicant and his statutory right to file the complaint will become infructuous. I say that even two appeals being No. 1136 of 2018 and 1250 of 2018 against the subject impugned order filed by Respondent No. 3 and 4 herein is pending before this Hon’ble Court and this Hon’ble Court shall be hearing the same as such no prejudice will be caused anyone if my appeal is also heard alongwith the said appeal. The appellant herein has already filed detail reply in said appeals and has brought the said facts before this Hon’ble Court as such if present application is allowed parties shall not be taken by surprised or new facts.
15.   It is seen that in F.A. No. 1136 of 2018 and in F.A. No. 1858 of 2019 the number(s) of days of delay in the applications for condonation of delay have been left blank.
In F.A. No. 1250 of 2018 the self-admitted self-computed delay is written to be 1282 days.
16.   A mere perusal of the three applications for condonation of delay shows that the stated reasons therein have a ring of untruth, and, in the totality of the facts, it would not be wrong to say that the edifice on which the stated reasons is built has its foundation on blatant untruth professed brazenly.
It is evident that,
after the Complainant had dutifully complied with the direction contained in sub-para 3 of the Award made by the State Commission (on 04.04.2015),
after the Complainant had moved execution (on 09.01.2018),
after the Opposite Parties renegaded on the directions contained in sub-para 2 and sub-paras 4 to 7 of the Award for about 2 years 9 months and 5 days i.e. 1011 days (from 04.04.2015 to 09.01.2018),
after the prescribed period of limitation of 30 days had long elapsed (in early 2015),
after the Order of the State Commission had attained finality and had been put to execution,
after the State Commission had taken cognizance and was conducting trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986,
the instant three F.A.s were filed before this Commission by the Appellants, the Opposite Parties No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 before the State Commission, judgment debtors / accused before the State Commission.
This is nothing but bald-faced disregard to the law of limitation, and an anyhow attempt to thwart the trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986.
17.   Sufficient cause to condone the delay is not visible.
18.   There is no mitigating factor forthcoming to condone the delay. On the contrary, it would be unjust, albeit a travesty of justice, if, in such facts and situation, as succinctly summed-up above, the Complainant is put to prejudice by condoning the delay in these three heavily time-barred Appeals.
","19.   The applications for condonation of delay, being patently ill-conceived and totally bereft of merit, are dismissed.
20.   Resultantly, the three Appeals stand dismissed on limitation.
B.     A.E. No. 94 of 2018, A.E. No. 107 of 2018 and A.E. No. 109 of 2018
21.   The said three Appeals (Execution) have been filed under Section 27A of the Act 1986, challenging the Order dated 08.03.2018 passed by the State Commission in E.A. No. 08 of 2018 in C.C. No. 304 of 2011.
22.   The Appellant in A.E. No. 94 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 3 before the State Commission, the Appellant in A.E. No. 107 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 2 before the State Commission and the Appellant in A.E. No. 109 of 2018 was the Opposite Party No. 5 before the State Commission.
All three Appellants are judgment debtors / accused before the State Commission in execution proceedings.
23.   A perusal of the State Commission’s impugned Order of 08.03.2018 shows that it has been passed in trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986. The trial is still being conducted by the State Commission, it has as yet not concluded the trial.
24.   Learned Counsel for the Appellants argued that the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. is not being followed by the State Commission.
However, the complete relevant material, including the chronological proceedings before the State Commission and the Statements recorded by the State Commission, have not been filed by any of the Appellants in any of the Appeals (Execution). The onus of filing the complete relevant material, including the proceedings and Statements, etc., was on the Appellants, which onus they have failed to discharge. In the absence of the complete relevant material, it is difficult to examine whether or not the procedure prescribed under the Cr.P.C. is being followed.
25.   This Commission would not want to unnecessarily impede or interfere in the trial of offence under Section 27 of the Act 1986, unless a palpable, crucial error is forthcoming, which, as already said, is difficult to discern in the absence of the complete relevant material having been placed on record.
26.   In such facts and situation, the ends of justice would be met by the following directions:
[a] The Appellants shall present themselves in person before the State Commission on 30.03.2020, the next date fixed by the State Commission.
[b] The Appellants shall be free to be accompanied by their respective advocates.
[c] The Appellants shall be free to raise all their issues and contentions and to make all their submissions before the State Commission.
[d] The State Commission shall adjudicate as per the law, the trial of offence punishable under Section 27 of the Act 1986 shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions for Trial Of Summons-Cases By Magistrates as contained in Chapter XX of the Cr.P.C.
[e] The Appellants shall have liberty to file Appeal(s) under Section 27A if they are aggrieved by any order of the State Commission, including, specifically,
(i) in case of any significant material infringement of the applicable provisions of the Cr.P.C., or
(ii) against any sentence of imprisonment or fine or both.
Needless to say, such Appeal(s), if and when filed, shall be considered on merit as per the law.
27.   The three Appeals (Execution) are so disposed.
‘Dasti’, in addition, to all parties.

HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainant who is petitioner in RP No.2112-2113 of 2013, purchased a second hand truck for Rs.11,67,500/- and got the same financed from the petitioner in RP No.1790 of 2013 to the extent of Rs.9 lacs.  The loan amount was repayable in 36 monthly installments.  The complainant paid installments upto May 2009 but thereafter, defaulted in payment of four installments.  The vehicle was therefore, repossessed by the financer on 22.10.2009.  The case of the complainant is that no notice was given to him before repossessing the vehicle and the same was repossessed forcibly without following the due legal process.  The complainant therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint seeking return of the truck or refund of Rs.7,61,832/- with interest and also sought compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- for financial loss and Rs.90,000/- towards mental agony.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the financer who inter-alia stated in its reply that the complainant having defaulted in repayment of the installment, the vehicle was repossessed on 22.10.2009 with due intimation given to the concerned Police Station.  The vehicle was thereafter, sold when the complainant did not respond to the demand letter sent to him on 19.01.2011.
3.      The District Forum awarded compensation of Rs.7,61,822/- to the complainant alongwith interest towards the price of the truck and also awarded compensation of Rs.75,000/- towards financial loss and Rs.15,000/- for mental agony.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, both the parties approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.
5.      Vide impugned order dated 31.01.2013, the State Commission directed the financer to pay a sum of Rs.1,21,827/- to the complainant.  The said amount was worked out after deducting the amount payable by the complainant to the financer from the IDV of the vehicle.  No compensation was awarded to the complainant.  Being aggrieved, both the parties are before this Commission by way of these cross Revision Petitions.
6.      It is not in dispute that the complainant had taken a loan for purchasing the vehicle.  It is also not in dispute that the complainant had defaulted in servicing the loan, he having not paid four installments.  The financer would therefore, be entitled to repossess the vehicle.  But, the vehicle could not have been repossessed by the financer without following the due process of law.  There is no evidence to prove that the due process of law was followed before repossessing the vehicle.  The State Commission found that though a notice is alleged to have been sent by the financer to the complainant two days before repossessing of the vehicle, there was no evidence to prove service of the said notice.  The least expected from the financer was to send a demand letter to the complainant asking him to clear the outstandings and inform him that the vehicle would be repossessed if the outstanding amount was not paid.  That however, was not done and the vehicle was repossessed only financer by use of force instead of following the due process of law.  Therefore, it cannot be disputed that the financer had been deficient in rendering services to the complainant.
7.      In ICICI Bank Ltd. Vs. Prakash Kaur & Ors. (2007) 2 SCC 711, the petitioner purchased a truck getting it financed from ICICI Bank.  He having defaulted in payment of the instalments, the possession of the truck was taken by the Bank by use of force.  The truck having not been returned to him, a Writ Petition was filed by him, seeking registration of an FIR.  Disapproving the course of action adopted by the Bank, the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed the Bank to forthwith release the truck to the petitioner.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court was of the view that instead of taking resort to strong arm tactics, the bank should resort to procedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicle in cases where borrower itself defaulted in payment of instalments.  During the course of a separate judgment, Hon’ble Dr. Justice A.R. Laxmanan noted that the recovery/collection agents who are contractors hired by the banks, physically and mentally torture them and force them into paying the dues and the self-respect of a man and his stature in society is immaterial to such agents.  His Lordship also observed that many a times even notice is not given to the borrowers who purchased the vehicles on hire-purchase basis and the vehicle is seized in public places deliberately in order to cause embarrassment to the borrower.  In a subsequent decision CITICORPN. Maruti Finance Ltd. Vs. S. Vijalaxmi IV (2011) CPJ 67 (SC), a Three Judges-Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court reiterated as under:
“We reiterate the earlier view taken that even in case of mortgaged goods subject to Hire Purchase Agreements, the recovery process has to be in accordance with law and the recovery process referred to in the Agreements also contemplates such recovery to be effected in due process of law and not by use of force.  Till such time as the ownership is not transferred to the purchaser, the hirer normally continues to be the owner of the goods, but that does not entitle him on the strength of the agreement to take back possession of the vehicle by use of force”.
8.    Relying upon the aforesaid decisions, this Commission vide its order dated 13.03.2015 in R.P. No.3054 of 2014 (Manager, Shri Ram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. vs. R. Suresh & Ors.) inter-alia held as under:-
“8.      In our view, when a transporter finance company such as the petitioner before us, finances a vehicle and there is a default on the part of the borrower in servicing the loan taken by him, it must necessarily issue a notice to him expressing its intention to repossess the vehicle in exercise of the power conferred upon it under the loan agreement before the vehicle is actually repossessed by it.  The purpose behind insisting upon such a notice being given to the borrower is to give him an opportunity to approach the financer and either bring the payment if already made by him to the knowledge of the financer or to convince the finance that it was on account of reasons beyond his control that he could not service the loan and, therefore, the default committed by him may be condoned.  It is quite possible that the financer may get convinced from the circumstances so explained by the borrower and may not insist upon repossessing the vehicle, his primary objective being to recovery of loan given to the borrower and not to repossess the vehicle financed by it.  If a vehicle is repossessed, without giving such a notice to the borrower, not only it has the potential to disrupt the business or profession in which the borrower is engaged using the vehicle, it may also result in his image and reputation in the society being lowered on account of the abrupt, sudden and forcible seizure of the vehicle by the financer.  If a notice expressing intention to repossess the vehicle on the default of the borrower is given to him, he gets ample opportunity to prevent the proposed seizure by approaching the financer and either paying the amount which he was unable to pay alongwith appropriate interest and/or penalty on that amount or to dispose of the vehicle at his own level and repay the loan taken by him.  Therefore, in all fairness, the financer must give a reasonable notice to the borrower before repossessing the vehicle financed by it and in no case the vehicle should be possessed by use of force.
………
………
11. … In our opinion, the seizure of the vehicle in such circumstances constitutes deficiency in service causing tremendous mental torture and stress to the borrower who all of a sudden finds himself without the vehicle which he had purchased albit with the financial assistance taken from the lender.  The borrower in such circumstances does not get an opportunity to arrange the requisite finances to repay the amount which he defaulted in paying to the lender before the vehicle comes to be repossessed by the lender.  The mental torture and agony would be greater when the vehicle is repossessed in his absence.”
For the reasons stated hereinabove, the complainant/petitioner is entitled to appropriate compensation from the respondent for the aforesaid deficiency in the service.
9.      The vehicle was sold by the financer for a sum of Rs.3,16,500/- though the IDV of the vehicle as calculated by the State Commission after deducting the depreciation for two years, was more than Rs.7.5 lacs.  This clearly shows that the vehicle was sold away at a throw away price. There is no evidence to show that the vehicle was sold by way of a public auction after giving due public notice in newspapers etc.  Had the financer duly publicized the proposed sale of the vehicle, it would have given an opportunity to the complainant to participate in the auction or to ensure that potential buyers were present at the time of auction and it was possible to sell the vehicle at its prevailing market price.  That having not been done, this was yet another act of deficiency on the part of the financer in rendering services to the complainant.
10.    The State Commission has taken a very fair and reasonable view while assessing the net amount payable by the petitioner to the complainant.  The State Commission deducted depreciation of two years from the IDV of the vehicle and thereafter, it deducted the amount payable by the complainant to the financer from the said IDV.  The remaining amount payable by the financer in this manner came to Rs.1,21,827/- which the State Commission has awarded to the complainant.
11.    However, the State Commission, in my opinion, was not justified in not awarding any compensation to the complainant for the deficiency in rendering services to the complainant.  The complainant had claimed a compensation amounting to Rs.2 lacs and his counsel submits that the amount claimed by him being fair and reasonable, should be awarded meaning thereby that it should be fixed at Rs.2 lacs as against the amount awarded by the District Forum.  Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of deficiency, the financer, in my opinion, should pay an all-inclusive compensation quantified at Rs.2 lacs to the complainant.
","12.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the Revision Petitions are disposed of with the following directions:
(i) The financer M/s Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. shall refund a sum of Rs.1,21,827/- to the complainant in terms of the order of the State Commission.
(ii)      The financer M/s Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd. shall also pay a sum of Rs.2 lacs as compensation to the complainant.
(iii)     The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months failing which it shall carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of this order.
The Revision Petitions stand disposed of.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. C. VISWANATH,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Supriyo Raychaudhuri (In Person) 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.       The case of the Petitioner/Complainant is that he is a subscriber of Respondent No.2/local cable operator under Respondent No.1/GTPL Kolkata Cable and Broadband Pariseva Ltd., who is the Multi System Operator (MSO). The Petitioner utilized the cable services through the rental set top box from December, 2012 to June, 2017, i.e. when the television set of the Complainant got completely damaged. The set top box was taken by Respondent No.1 for repairs and later a new set top box was provided free of cost, but the television set was not functioning. Hence, the Petitioner approached the District Forum with following prayers: -
“(a)   That the LCO return the old STB of your Complainant removed from the residence of your Complainant on 23rd June, 2017 and stated to lying in the repairing shop of the MSO together with the remote control hand set of the old set top box which was collected from your Complainant on 4th August, 2017 in exchange for the new remote control hand set of the new STB.
(b)     LCO furnish your Complainant receipts for payments made to him towards price of the new STB supplied and installed at the residence of your complainant, together with a bill for the STB so purchased.
(c)      That pending disposal of the case, the LCO with MSO ensure continuous and uninterrupted service of the channels subscribed by your Complainant without imposing any pressure tactics by any means, including by the local people working for them or otherwise known to them through business connections.
(d)     That the LCO and MSO jointly and severally pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) as compensation for harassment, mental agony, deficiency of service and  unfair trade practice.”
2.       The Respondents/Opposite Parties contested the matter that the Petitioner/Complainant is not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and that there was no deficiency of service on their part and the Complaint be dismissed.
","3.       The District Forum after hearing the parties and perusing the material on record dismissed the Complaint, vide order dated 25.07.2018, with the following observation:-
“It appears from the evidence of the complainant as well as from the materials on record that on the basis of the complaint lodged by the complainant STB was replaced and another STB was provided which was also not functioning and was providing picture in the said TV. The Ops raised objection that the TV in question had some technical defects for which cable operation i.e. OP No.2 cannot be held liable for the non-functioning of the TV. Whenever such points were raised by OPs regarding the normal functioning of the said TV the Complainant ought to have produced an expert’s opinion to the effect that the TV was functioning in normal way, but due to the cable connection or the STB provided by OPs he was not in a position to enjoy the TV programme. Since the Complainant has failed to prove that the TV in question was functioning in normal way particularly when OPs challenged the normal functioning of the TV, therefore, we hold that the case filed by the Complainant has got no merit and the Complainant will not be entitled to get any relief as prayed for. Thus all the points are disposed of accordingly.
Hence ordered,
That the case No.259 of 2017 is dismissed on contest without cost against the OPs.
4.       Against the order of the District Forum, an Appeal was filed before the State Commission. The State Commission after hearing the parties, affirmed the order of the District Forum and dismissed the Appeal.
5.       Heard the Petitioner in person. The Petitioner has availed the services of Respondent No.2/local cable operator for watching programmes on the television. Respondent No.2 had initially supplied a rental set top box in December, 2012 and the Petitioner received the cable signals through the same till 20.02.2017. Since midnight of 22.06.2017 he could not see the programmes on his television set. The set top box provided by Respondent No.1 was taken for repair and thereafter a new set top box, free of cost, was provided to the Petitioner but still the Petitioner could not watch the television. It is evident that the Respondents provided prompt services to the Petitioner by taking the set top box for repair and later providing a new set top box free of cost. There was no deficiency in service on the part of the Respondents. The Petitioner has not provided any evidence to the effect that the television set which was to receive the signals and screen the programme was in order and that the fault was with the set top box. The television did receive the signals for many years through the same set top box and the Petitioner saw programmes on the same television uninterruptedly. Later, the service provider did what all he could do or is expected of a service provider, including replacing the set top box free of cost. I see no deficiency in service on the part of the Respondents. Hence, the Revision Petition stands dismissed at the admission stage.

The Complainants had taken a Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy from the Appellant for the period from 22.08.2006 to 21.08.2009 in respect of their plant and machinery as well as in respect of the stock comprising egg and chicken.  The policy is stated to have been taken through Respondent Bank of India from which a loan had been taken by the Complainants.  There was damage to the live stock as well as to the building shed and plant and machinery of the Complainants, in a cyclone which struck their premises on 25.05.2009.  On intimation being given to the insurer, a surveyor was appointed to assess the loss to the Complainants.  The surveyor assessed the loss to the Complainant at ₹8,97,284/-.  The insurer, however, made its own assessment and based on that, offered only an amount of ₹4,33,872/- to the Complainants in full and final settlement of their claim.  The Complainant executed a discharge voucher in favour of the insurer on 23.02.2011, whereupon the aforesaid amount of ₹4,33,872/- was paid to the Bank for being credited in the loan account of the Complainants.
2.      Alleging deficiency in service on the part of the Bank as well as on the part of the insurer in rendering service to them, the
-3-
Complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of a Consumer Complaint.
3.      The Complaint was resisted by the Bank as well as by the insurer.  It was inter alia stated in the written version filed by the insurer that the Complainants having accepted payment of ₹4,33,872/- in full and final settlement of their claim and therefore, were precluded from claiming any additional payment from the insurer.
4.      Vide the impugned order dated 07.08.2018, the State Commission has directed as under:
“The complaint case stands allowed on contest against the OPs.  OP Nos. 1&2 are debarred from staking further claim in terms of their letter dated 01-02-2013 and release all pledged securities/documents and handover the same to the Complainants within 40 days from today.  They shall also pay a compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for causing unwarranted harassment, stress and agony to the Complainants, i.d., simple interest @ 9% p.a. over this amount shall accrue for the entire period of default.  OP No. 3 shall release balance payable amount as narrated hereinabove in favour of the Complainants within 40 days from this day along with simple interest @ 9% p.a. over the balance claim amount payable to the Complainants from 27-05-2013 till full and final payment is made. Complainants shall also be entitled to litigation cost to the tune of Rs. 50,000/- to be equally paid by the OP Nos. 1&2 and OP No. 3 within the aforesaid period.”
5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the insurer is before this Commission by way of this Appeal.

6.      The discharge voucher executed by the Complainants dated 23.02.2011 to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“REF.: D. V. No.:                                                 FORM No.B-17

23-2-2011
7.      It is not in dispute that the discharge voucher is executed by the Complainants.  The case of the Complainants is that since they were in financial difficulties, their loan account had been declared NPR, the Bank was seeking to recover the loan by issuing a notice under Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act and there was threat of their securities being sold by the Bank in order to recover the loan, they were left with no option but to accept the offer made by the insurer.  In other words, the case of the Complainants is that the execution of the discharge voucher by them was not a voluntary act and they were compelled to execute the discharge voucher on account of their being in financial stress at that time including threat from the Bank to enforce the loan by selling their securities.
-5-
8.      Thus, the only question which arises for consideration in this Appeal is as to whether the divorce voucher was executed voluntarily or it was a product of any kind of duress, compulsion, coercion etc.  Admittedly, the payment to the Bank on behalf of the Complainants was made in February 2011.  Not a single letter was written by the Complainants to the insurer soon after receiving the settlement amount of ₹4,33,872/- or even thereafter, till they filed the Consumer Complaint on 27.05.2013 after more than two years and three months of executing the discharge voucher.  If the discharge voucher was not executed voluntarily and the Complainants were compelled to execute the same on account of threat from the Bank to sell their securities in order to recover the loan, the least expected from the Complainants was to write to the insurer after receiving the settlement amount of ₹4,33,872/-, stating therein that the discharge voucher had been executed and the payment of ₹4,33,872/-, had been accepted by them under coercion or due to financial stress and the said execution was not a voluntary act on their part.  The conduct of the Complainants in remaining silent for more than two years after executing the discharge voucher clearly indicates that the discharge voucher was executed voluntarily and was not on account of the
-6-
Complainants’ having been no option left with them except to execute the discharge voucher and accept the amount offered to them by the insurer.
9.      The issue involved herein recently came to be examined by this Commission in “M/s Pankaj Trading Company vs. National Insurance Company Limited, Revision Petition No.2771 of 2017” decided on 19.02.2020 and the following view was taken:
“8.      The issue involved in this case came up for consideration of this Commission recently in CC No.285 of 2013 M/s Elastrex Polymers Pvt. Ld. Vs. M/s New India Assurance Co. Ltd., decided on 16.08.2019 and the following view was taken:
(13)   The learned counsel for the complainant refers to the Circulars dated 24.09.2015 and 07.06.2016 issued by IRDA which to the extent they are relevant reads as under :
Circular dated 24.09.2015
“The Insurance Companies are using ‘discharge voucher’ or “settlement intimation voucher” or in some other name, so that the claim is closed and does not remain outstanding in their books.  However, of late, the Authority has been received complaints from aggrieved policyholders that the said instrument of discharge voucher is being used by the insurers in the judicial fora with the plea that the full and final discharge given by the policyholders extinguish their rights to contest the claim before the Courts.
While the Authority notes that the insurers need to keep their books of accounts in order, it is also necessary to note that insurers shall not use the instrument of discharge voucher as a means of estoppel against the
-7-
aggrieved policy holders when such policy holder approaches judicial fora.
Accordingly insurers are hereby advised as under :
Where the liability and quantum of claim under a policy is established, the insurers shall not withhold claim amounts.  However, it should be clearly understood that execution of such vouchers does not foreclose the rights of policy holder to seek higher compensation before any judicial fora or any other fora established by law.
All insurers are directed to comply with the above instructions.
Circular dated 07.06.2016
Insurers are directed to comply with the above with immediate effect.
(14)   It is seen that after issuance of the circular dated 24.09.2015 the insurers represented to IRDA that the said circular was not in the line with the IRDA (protection of policyholders interests) Regulation, 2002 and the provisions of Indian Contract Act.  On receipt of representation from the insurers IRDA reviewed the matter in the light of the provisions of Contract Act, P.P.I. Regulation and the judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and issued the directions contained in the Circular dated 07.06.2016.
-8-
(15)   It would be seen that vide subsequent Circular dated 07.06.2016 IRDA will permitting the continuance of the practice of obtaining discharge voucher it, only instructed the insurers not to obtain such vouchers under duress, by coercion, by force or compulsion.  None of these circumstances however have been established in this case.  Though IRDA Circular enjoins upon the insurer to pay the amount assessed by it without waiting for the discharge voucher in case the offer made by them is disputed by the insured, in the present there is no evidence of any kind of protest by the insured before sending the discharge voucher to the insurer on the very same day on which it received the same alongwith a forwarding letter.  Therefore, it cannot be said that there was a non-compliance of the aforesaid circulars though the contention of the learned counsel is that both the circulars came to be issued by years after the payment was accepted in this case.
(17)   The issue involved in this complaint came up for the consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in United India Insurance Vs. Ajmer Singh Cotton & General Mills & Ors. (1999) 6 SCC 400 and the following view was taken :
“4…………  The mere execution of the discharge voucher would not always deprive the consumer from preferring claim with respect to the deficiency in service or consequential benefits arising out of the amount paid in default of the service rendered.  Despite execution of the discharge voucher, the consumer may be in a position to satisfy the Tribunal or the Commission under the Act that such discharge voucher or receipt had been obtained from him under the circumstances which can be termed as fraudulent or exercise of undue influence or by misrepresentation or the like.  If in a given case the consumer satisfies the authority under the Act that the discharge voucher was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence or the like, coercive bargaining compelled by circumstances, the authority before whom the complainant is made would be justified in granting appropriate relief.  However (sic so), where such discharge voucher is proved to have been obtained under any of the suspicious circumstances noted hereinabove, the Tribunal or the commission would be justified in granting the appropriate relief under the circumstances as noticed earlier.  The Consumer
-9-
Disputes Redressal Forums and Commissions constituted under the Act shall also have the power to fasten liability against the insurance companies notwithstanding the issuance of the discharge voucher.”
This issue also came up for consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Genus Power Infrastructure Ltd. (2015) 2 SCC 424, and the following view was taken:
“7.    The question that arises is whether the discharge in the present case upon acceptance of compensation and signing of subrogation letter was not voluntary and whether the claimant was subjected to compulsion or coercion and as such could validly invoke the jurisdiction under Section 11 of the Act.  The law on the point is clear form following decisions of this Court.  In National Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Boghara Polyfab (P) Ltd. in paras 26 and 51 it was stated as under (SCC pp. 284-85 and 294)
26.   when we refer to a discharge of contract by an agreement signed by both the parties or by execution of a full and final discharge voucher / receipt b one of the parties, we refer to an agreement or discharge voucher which is validly and voluntarily executed.  If the party which has executed the discharge agreement or discharge voucher, alleges that the execution of such discharge agreement or voucher was on account of fraud / coercion / undue influence practised by the other party and is able to establish the same, then obviously the discharge of the contract by such agreement / voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon.”
8.     ……………..  A bald plea of fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence is not enough and the party who sets up such a plea must prima facie establish the same by placing material before the Chief Justice / his designate.  If the Chief Justice / his designate funds some merit in the allegation of fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence, he may decide the same or leave it to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  On the other hand, if such plea is found to be an afterthought, make-believe or lacking in credibility, the matter must be set at the rest then and there.”
9.     It is therefore, clear that a bald plea of fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence is not enough and
-10-
the party who sets up a plea, must prima facie establish the same by placing material before the Chief Justice / his designate.”
10.   In our considered view, the plea raised by the respondent is bereft of any details and particulars, and cannot be anything but a bald assertion.  Given the fact that there was no protest or demur raised around the time or soon after the letter of subrogation was signed, that the notice dated 31.3.2011 itself was nearly after three weeks and that the financial condition of the respondent was not so precarious that it was left with no alternative but to accept the terms as suggested, we are of the firm view that the discharge in the present case and signing of letter of subrogation were not because of exercise of any undue influence.  Such discharge and signing of letter of subrogation was voluntary and free from any coercion or undue influence.”
10.    In fact even the Consumer Complaint to the extent it was directed against the insurer was barred by limitation on the date it was filed.  In terms of Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, a Consumer Complaint is required to be instituted within two years of the date on which the cause of action accrues to the Complainant.  The cause of action to file a Consumer Complaint against the insurer accrued on the date the payment was received by the Bank on behalf of the Complainants.  The payment having been received in February 2011 and the Consumer Complaint having been filed in May 2013, it was clearly barred by limitation.  No application seeking condonation of delay in terms of the proviso to Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was filed by the Complainants.  Even if the plea of limitation is not
-11-
","taken in the written version, this Commission is mandated by law to ensure that a Complaint barred by limitation is dismissed unless the delay in filing the Consumer Complaint is condoned.  Reference in that regard can be made to the following view taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “State Bank of India Vs. B.S. Agriculture Industries (I) (2009) 5 SCC 121”.
“7.            Section 24A of the Act, 1986 prescribes limitation period for admission of a complaint by the consumer fora thus:
""24A. Limitation period - (1) The District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission shall not admit a complaint unless it is filed within two years from the date on which the cause of action has arisen.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub- section (1), a complaint may be entertained after the period specified in sub-section (1), if the complainant satisfies the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, that he had sufficient cause for not filing the complaint within such period:
Provided that no such complaint shall be entertained unless the National Commission, the State Commission or the District Forum, as the case may be, records its reasons for condoning such delay.""
8.              It would be seen from the aforesaid provision that it is peremptory in nature and requires consumer forum to see before it admits the complaint that it has been filed within two years from the date of accrual of cause of action. The consumer forum, however, for the reasons to be recorded in writing may condone the delay in filing the complaint if sufficient cause is shown. The expression, `shall not admit a complaint' occurring in Section 24A is sort of a legislative command to the consumer forum to examine on its own whether the complaint has been filed within limitation period prescribed thereunder. As a matter of law, the consumer forum must deal with the complaint on merits only if the complaint has been filed within two
-12-
years from the date of accrual of cause of action and if beyond the said period, the sufficient cause has been shown and delay condoned for the reasons recorded in writing. In other words, it is the duty of the consumer forum to take notice of Section 24A and give effect to it. If the complaint is barred by time and yet, the consumer forum decides the complaint on merits, the forum would be committing an illegality and, therefore, the aggrieved party would be entitled to have such order set aside.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order to the extent it is directed against the insurer cannot be sustained and the same is hereby set aside.  The Consumer Complaint against the insurer is consequently dismissed.  It is, however, made clear that dismissal of the Consumer Complaint against the insurer will not affect the impugned order to the extent it is directed against the Bank of the Complainants.

1.      This revision petition has been filed challenging the order of the State Commission dated 26.06.2020 whereby the appeal of the petitioner was dismissed for non-prosecution.
2.      The brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant had filed a complaint before the District Forum asking for the refund of the amount alongwith other reliefs, which he had deposited with the petitioner for purchase of the subject property and since the petitioner did not honour the terms of the contract and could not give the possession of the subject property to him, he had asked for the refund of his deposited amount alongwith other reliefs.  The petitioner had contested the complaint and produced evidences and the District Forum after considering the evidences of the parties and hearing the arguing counsels on behalf of the parties, on merit  passed the order dated 25.11.2019 against the petitioner asking him to refund the amount deposited by him alongwith other relief.
3.      The petitioner being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum filed an appeal.  On the hearing, the following order dated 24.1.2020 was passed by the State Commission :
“Heard.
Admitted.
Notice be issued to respondent for 24.03.2020, subject to deposit of Rs.10,000/- within three weeks in the Registry towards expenses of engaging counsel and to and for expenses of respondent/complainant only by way of Demand Draft in the name of the complainant.  Registry is directed to issue notice only after compliance of this condition by the appellants.
Record (Scanned/Photocopy) of the District Forum be called, as per the latest guidelines issued by the Hon’ble National Commission, vide letter No.M-20/NCDRC/2018 dated 30.08.2018.”
4.      The petitioner, however, did not honour the directions of the State Commission and did not pay to and fro expenses to the complainant.
5.        He moved an application for extension of time to deposit of the to and fro expenses as directed by the State Commission but the State Commission vide impugned order dated 26.6.2020 dismissed the application, stating therein that it amounted to review of its own order which was not permissible under the old Act of 1986, held as under :
M.A.No.645 of 2020 (For extension of time to deposit cost) & Main case
Heard.
Vide order dated 24.01.2020, notice was ordered to be issued to respondent for 24.03.2020, subject to deposit of Rs.10,000/- within three weeks in the Registry towards expenses of engaging counsel and to and fro expenses of respondent/complainant. The amount of Rs.10,000/- was not deposited by the appellants.
","2. After expiry of stipulated period, learned counsel for the appellants moved Misc. Application No.645 of 2020 for extension of time to deposit the cost of Rs.10,000/- on the ground that due to communication gap and other official formalities the said amount could not be deposited. The order was passed on 24.01.2020. Three weeks period provided in the said order expired on 14.02.2020. During that period there was no pandemic of COVID-19. Even otherwise, the said application cannot be accepted and the time cannot be extended as it will amount to review of my own order and I have no power to recall/review my own order. The position has been made clear by catena of judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. It was held in “Rajeev Hitendra Pathak & Ors. Vs. Achyut Kashinath Karekar & Anr.” IV (2011) CPJ 35 (SC) that neither the State Commission nor District Forum has, under the provisions of the Act, the power to review/recall/modify an order passed by it. That proposition of law was again reiterated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Lucknow Development Authority Vs. Shyam Kapoor” 2013(1) CPR 597 (SC). Application is dismissed accordingly.
Main Case
3. Since the amount of Rs.10,000/- has not been deposited, which was condition precedent to issue notice to the respondent, hence the appeal filed by the appellants is dismissed, due to non-compliance of order dated 24.01.2020.
4. The appellants had deposited a sum of Rs.25,000/- at the time of filing of the appeal. This amount, along with interest which has accrued thereon, if any, shall be remitted by the Registry to the District Forum forthwith. The complainant may approach the District Forum for the release of the above amount and the District Forum may pass the appropriate order in this regard after the expiry of limitation period in accordance with law.
6.      During the course of arguments learned counsel has admitted that notice of the appeal was not served upon the respondent as he did not comply with the directions.  No notice of MA in which the impugned order was passed was also issued to the respondent/complainant.   It is apparent that the respondent/complainant is not in picture and, therefore, there is no necessity of issuing any notice of the present revision petition to him.
7.      I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner.  Since, it is an admitted fact that the petitioner had failed to honoured the directions of the State Commission and did not deposit  the to and fro expenses and subsequently only moved an application for extension of time, and since it is also an admitted fact that the respondent had paid him a sum of Rs.11,78,326/- towards purchase of the subject property and it is  also an admitted fact that the subject property was not handed over to him, in the interest of justice and in exercise of power under Section 13 (3B) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 now Section 38 (8) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, while setting aside the impugned order and giving the petitioner ten days’ time to comply with the directions of the State Commission dated 24.01.2020 and also subject to petitioner depositing the entire sum of Rs.11,78,326/-  with the District Forum within a period of four weeks (it being the money which the respondent/complainant had paid to them and which this Commission is of the opinion should be secured), the present revision petition is allowed.
8.      Copy of this order shall be sent to the State Commission immediately.  The petitioner is directed to appear before the State Commission on 02.12.2020.
9.      In case of non-compliance of these directions, this order will have no effect and revision petition should be considered as being dismissed.

2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent no.1, after being satisfied with the proposed project of the appellant company agreed to purchase a flat bearing no.1802, on the 18th floor, tower 14 LH, admeasuring 1900 sq.ft. in the said project of the appellant, vide provisional allotment application dated 13.07.2007.  On 20.11.2007, the respondent no.1 signed the agreement for sale of above mentioned flat for a total consideration of Rs.1,00,40,000/- (rupees one crore forty thousand only).  The respondent no.1 and appellant mutually agreed to allot another apartment being flat no.1703, tower no.10 LH to the respondent No.1 in place of previously allotted flat bearing no.1802, on the 18th floor, tower 14 LH and the appellant thereafter issued a provisional allotment letter to the respondent no.1 on 17.05.2008 for the above flat.  On 24.07.2008, the appellant and the respondent No.1 thereafter, through his GPA holder Mr. Tumu Veerabhadra Rao, entered into agreements for the sale of land and built-up area for flat bearing no.1703 on 17th floor, in tower no.10LH admeasuring 1904 sq.ft. for a total sale consideration of Rs.1,00,03,360/-.  The appellant and the respondent entered into a tripartite agreement on the same date i.e. 24.07.2008, according to which, respondent no.2 was to disburse the amount/instalment directly to the appellant company. The respondent no.2 thereafter on various dates in 2008-2009, disbursed to the appellant company a total amount of Rs.57,36,360/- (rupees fifty seven lacs thirty six thousand three hundred and sixty only).  On 01.06.2011, respondent no.2 requested the appellant to pay the amounts disbursed under the sanctioned loan.  On 13.06.2011, the appellant thereafter, received a letter whereby the respondent no.1 for the first time raised a demand for refund of the amount paid towards 15% of the consideration along with interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of receipt of amount till the date of settlement as also refund the entire amount paid by respondent no.1 to the respondent no.2 and the amount released by the respondent no.2 pursuant to the sanction of the home loan to the appellant.  On 15.10.2012, the respondent no.1 filed a consumer complaint bearing CC No.125/2012 before the State Commission alleging deficient services on the part of appellant company and claiming refund of the amount paid by respondent no.1 and 2 along with interest and cost. The State Commission vide its order dated 27.12.2014, has allowed the complaint and has directed the appellant to:
(a)  Pay an amount of Rs.15,06,075/- with interest @9% p.a. from the date of respective payments made by respondent no.1 to the appellant till the date of realization; and
(b)  pay an amount of Rs.57,36,358/- towards repayment of loan (availed by the respondent no.1) received from the respondent no.2 bank herein along with an interest @11% p.a. from the respective date of payments by the bank to the appellant and penal interest, if any, till the date of payment.
3.      Hence the present appeal.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the appellant as well as respondent No.1/ the complainant. None appeared on behalf of the respondent No.2 Indian Bank despite service of notice.
5.      The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the State Commission failed to appreciate that the delay in construction and the handing over of the possession of the flat bearing no.1703 on the 17th floor, in tower 10LH was on account of force majeure events namely litigation and stay orders by courts, which were beyond the reasonable control of the appellant and which events admittedly affected the development of the project.
6.      The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the State Commission failed to appreciate that the unforeseen litigation initiated against the appellant company and stay orders by courts were force majeure events covered under the agreement between the parties.  Therefore, the period during which the said events affected the development of the project stood suspended.
7.      Learned counsel for the appellant further stated that the finding of the State Commission that the appellant failed to ensure necessary permission and to see that the project was free of litigation and therefore it amounted to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice is patently erroneous and without any pleadings to this effect.  There is nothing on record to even suggest that there was any issue with title of the property when the project was floated.
8.      It was further stated by the learned counsel for the appellant that the State Commission failed to consider the fact that as per the order dated 08.05.2012 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in an SLP filed by the appellant seeking stay of operation of the orders passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh State Wakf Tribunal, the title of the land with the appellant was undisputed and that compensation would be paid to the waqf/dargah in the event the land is finally declared as waqf/dargah land.  This itself shows that the appellant company had taken all possible measure to mitigate force majeure events.
9.      Learned counsel for the appellant also stated that the State Commission failed to take note of the order dated 08.05.2012 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in an SLP filed by the appellant seeking stay of operation of the orders passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh State Wakf Tribunal, which was filed along with the written statement filed by the appellant, on a hyper-technical ground that the said order was not exhibited in affidavit of evidence of the appellant.  The respondent had not disputed the said order or raised any objection thereto.  The State Commission ignored the fundamental legal principle that “Facts admitted need no proof”.
10.    It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that the finding of the State Commission that the respondent no.1 is entitled to terminate the agreement is patently erroneous and amounts to re-writing the agreement.  Admittedly the agreement does not contain any provision entitling the respondent no.1 to terminate the same.
11.    Learned counsel for the appellant mentioned that finding of the State Commission that the appellant sent SMS to the respondent no.1 to come and take refund of the money is erroneous as the appellant had categorically denied sending any SMS and the respondent no.1 was unable to prove that any SMS was sent by the appellant.  The finding of the State Commission is thus based on surmises and conjectures.
12.    It was further stated that the State Commission has erred in directing the appellant company to refund the amounts to the respondent on an incorrect and misconceived premise that the respondent no.1 had proved that the agreements for sale were terminated by the respondent no.1.  The State Commission has failed to consider that terms of the termination clause in the agreements only provide for termination by the appellant.  The appellant has never terminated the agreements.
13.    Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the State Commission failed to appreciate that as per Clause 7.7 and similar clauses of the said agreements, pertaining to the termination clause, the appellant company is not liable to pay interest on the refund/reimbursement, if any.  Thus, the grant of interest by the State Commission is illegal and erroneous.
14.    Learned counsel for the appellant further argued that the State Commission erred in holding that the appellant company is liable to pay even the penal interest to the respondent no.2.  The direction is harsh, oppressive and without any legal basis.
15.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent No.1 /complainant stated that the State Commission has given the finding that the opposite party had already agreed to refund the amount as an SMS was sent by the opposite party to the complainant. Once the opposite party had agreed to refund the amount, they cannot take an opposite position in the appeal. The opposite party is now denying the SMS that was sent by the opposite party.
16.    It was further stated by the learned counsel for the complainant that the land on which the project was coming up went in dispute and the matter was litigated up to the Hon’ble Supreme Court and therefore, the complainant did not want to block his funds in a project where the land title itself was disputed. Therefore, the complainant decided to withdraw from the project and to get his money back from the opposite party.
17.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the learned counsel for the parties and examined record. It is seen that  land became disputed by filing of OS No. 7/2011 by the Waqf Board/Dargah Hazrath Hussain Shah wali and due to land dispute, the complainant decided to withdraw from the project and sought refund of the deposited amount. Accordingly bank also wrote letter dated 1st June 2011 seeking return of the amount paid by the bank to the appellant. The complainant also wrote letter on 13th June 2011 for refunding the amount deposited by the complainant. The order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 8.5.2012 came later on and by that time, the complainant and the bank had already requested the appellant to refund the amounts paid by them. As there was no response from the opposite party, the complainant filed the consumer complaint on 15th October 2012. Most of the people would not like to invest in a project where the land is in dispute and the matter is in litigation. From this aspect, I find that the request of the complainant for refund of the amount was justified. Though the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 8th May 2012 had, in a way, allowed the project to continue, but the complainant may have still thought to dissociate from the project which was in litigation. In fact, the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court reads as under:
“Heard counsel on either side at length.  Considering the fact that the substantial portion of the construction is over and due for allotment, we are inclined to stay the orders dated 3.4.2012 passed by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and 28.3.2011 passed by the Andhra Pradesh State Wakf Tribunal in OS No.7/2011, until further orders.
We also record the submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the State that ultimately if it is found that it is the Wakf property, the State will compensate the plaintiff in the suit by money or by providing an alternative land.”
18.    From the above order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, it seems that the project could continue and if ultimately the land was found to be of Waqf or Dargah, then in that case, the IWaqf will be compensated in terms of money or by allotting some other land. Thus, there should have been no fear in the mind of the complainant about the land and the project. But for a conservative mind, even the request for refund cannot be treated as something illegal because the project was already delayed and the land was definitely in dispute.
19.    The appellant has raised an issue that there is no provision for cancellation of the allotment and refund of the money in the agreement and therefore the complainant could not have cancelled the allotment and the State Commission should not have allowed the cancellation. As per clause 7.5 of the agreement, if the opposite party cancels the allotment then the amount will be refunded without interest. Clearly, this provision is unilateral and does not keep the opposite party and the complainant on the same footing, therefore, this clause is nothing but an expression of unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party. Consumer forum has to see the deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party in a complaint case. If the deficiency in service is proved, then, the consumer forum has the right to order refund and to pass an order for compensation and even the penal compensation as per section 14(1)(c) and 14(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. Once the refund is ordered, the cancellation of the allotment and the agreement is consequential and does not require any formal request or order.
20.    The major argument of the learned counsel for the appellant has been that the project could not progress as planned on account of various court orders and this should be treated as force majeure condition. Then as per the agreement, no interest is required to be paid for this period and even the refund should not have been ordered. In this regard, the fact is that the complainant was suffering due to the litigation as the project was getting delayed and the complainant saw no chance of getting the possession of the property then the complainant asked for refund. The money of the complainant was blocked with the project and the complainant was not responsible for the litigations. Therefore, in my view, the complainant is entitled to get compensation even for this period.
21.    As has been examined earlier, that after the order dated 8th May 2012 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, there should have been no fear in respect of the completion of the project and about the handing over of the possession, but still the complainant chose to file the consumer complaint for refund of the amount paid. Though in the above examination, the request of the complainant for refund has been found to be justified, but the fact remains that once the complainant had booked a flat and had taken loan from the bank, seeking refund after the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 8th May 2012 was not really required and the complainant may have continued with the allotment. So far as interest is concerned, as the money remained with the opposite party for sufficient time, the opposite party is liable to pay interest on the amount of refund. The State Commission has ordered refund of the loan amount from the bank along with interest at the rate of 11% per annum and the amount paid by the complainant has been asked to be refunded along with interest at the rate 9% per annum. Both these rates of interest seem to be reasonable. Clearly the liability of refunding the bank loan is on the complainant and therefore if he had taken loan at 11%, then it is to be refunded along with interest at the rate 11% by the opposite party so that burden does not come on the complainant because ultimately the complainant is not getting the flat. However, as the complainant has proceeded with his request for refund even after the passing of the order dated 8th May 2012 by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, though there was no impediment in the progress of the project or in getting the possession, in my view, the complainant should only get marginal interest on the amount paid by him which is Rs.15,06,075/-. In the facts and circumstances of the case, an interest @ 5% per annum would be sufficient.
22.    Thus, on the basis of the above discussion, the first appeal No.174 of 2014 is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission is modified to the extent that the interest rate for refund of the amount paid by the complainant viz  Rs.15,06,075/- will be 5% per annum instead of 9% per annum. It is also clarified that no penal interest beyond 11% per annum on house loan amount will be paid by the opposite party.  If there is any, it shall be the responsibility of the complainant. Rest of the order of the State Commission including the refund of loan amount of Rs.57,36,358/- along with interest @ 11% per annum is confirmed.

                                                          (On behalf of both the Petitioners)

For the Respondent No.4                   :         NONE 
","1.       Revision Petition has been filed by the Petitioner under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the order passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in First Appeal No.1111/2013 dated 13.08.2015.
2.       Case of the Petitioners/Complainants is that Respondent No.2 published an advertisement informing admission for B. Tech and diploma course in Engineering for 2011-12. The advertisement mentioned that the institute was approved by Singhania University, Rajasthan. On seeing the advertisement, the Petitioner/Complainant took admission in B. Tech (Civil Engineering) Course in School of Engineering and Technology Institute. A fee of Rs.50,000/- was paid as university admission fees and a sum of Rs.52,500/- towards tuition fees in June, 2011. The Petitioner/Complainant also stated that Respondent No.4, an agent of A to Z Consultant was also paid Rs.75,000/- for securing a seat under the management quota. Petitioner No.1 joined the classes in the Institute. However, no regular classes were held. On checking the website he found that the institute was not recognized with Singhania University, Rajasthan but from CMG University, Meghalaya. The advertisement was totally false, baseless and frivolous. On checking the UGC website, circular dated 01.09.2011 revealed that some of the Universities are running centres on franchise basis which was not allowed and private university cannot affiliate institutions and colleges. They also cannot establish campus centres beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the State. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioner filed Complaint before the District Forum with following prayer: -
“Under the circumstances, it is, therefore most respectfully prayed that this petitioner be kindly allowed a total sum of Rs.3,22,500/- as detailed below:
A sum of Rs.1,02,500/- for fees paid vide receipt no.1026 dated 22.06.2011
A sum of Rs.75,000/- for Management Quota Fees without any voucher.
A sum of Rs.25,000/- for litigation cost.
A sum of Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for harassment and mental agony for the same.
A sum of Rs.20,000/- for up to date interest.”
3.       Respondents No.1, 2 & 3 contested the case. They contended that the Complaint was not maintainable in law. The Opposite Parties denied all the allegations made in the Complaint and stated that necessary documents will be submitted by the Opposite Parties at the time of hearing. The District Forum allowed the Complaint on contest and ordered as follows: -
“Hence ordered that the complaint be and the same is allowed on contest with cost of Rs.10,000/- against the OPs and OPs shall have to pay Rs.10,000/- to  the applicant.
OPs are hereby directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- to the complainants within one month from the date of this order as compensation for causing harassment, damaging the education career for one year and for grabbing the total amount as fees having no recognition of the OP-Institute to impart education.
For adopting unfair trade practice the educational trade-OPs are directed to pay a sum of Rs.50,000/- as punitive damages within one month from the date of this order to the State Consumer Welfare Fund.
If OP fails to comply with the order of this Forum within 30 days from the date of this order in that case an interest of Rs.200 per day shall be assessed for disobeying the Forum’s order and if it is collected same shall be deposited to the State Consumer Welfare Fund.
Even if repeated non-compliance of the order on the part of the O.P. is found in that case the penal action shall be taken against them, even positive penal action shall be taken for permanently closing down the entire institute by sealing the present institute (fake) run from the address.”
4.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, Appeal was filed by Opposite Parties No.1, 2 & 4, again reiterating that the Complaint was not maintainable. The State Commission after hearing the respective parties and going through the material on record came to the conclusion that the Complaint is not maintainable as the institute came under the purview of educational institution and education was not a commodity. The appeal was allowed on contest, setting aside the order of the District Forum.
5.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, present Revision Petition has been filed.
6.       Heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner as well as Respondents No.1 to 3 and carefully gone through the record. District Forum observed: “Moreover from the letter as produced by the O.P. it is found that the institute is not an institute but one Nibir Saha was appointed for the purpose of operating the admission matter of the student at Singhania University at Rajasthan not in the centre. Then question is how the O.P. in its brochure and advertisement declared that it is an institute to impart of technical and engineering education like B. Tech and other to the students that means the entire defence on the part of the O.Ps is false and fabricated. But giving hoax and alluring the students the present O.P. realized huge fees from the p resent complainant though it is a fake institute.
Further from another letter issued by CMG University Meghalaya it is found that Nibir Saha was authorized to provide needful guidance to the students interested for taking admission in their respective course at CMGA at Meghalaya University. So considering the documents it is clear that the entire institute is a fake institution having their no affiliation to impart technical education or any education to any students and not to admit the students in this institute in B.E. of any stream.
In the light of the above observation we are convinced to hold that the complainant’s allegations against the O.P. are proved beyond any manner of doubt.”
7.      Vide letter dated 21.05.2011 of Singhania University, the University had provisionally appointed Respondent No.2 Mr. Nivir Saha as Manager (Admission and Operation Centre), Singhania University, Pancheri Bari Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He was authorized to open admission and operation centre at School of Engineering & Technology in Salt Lake City, Kolkata. The status of the centre was only provisional, subject to completion of formalities. The entire responsibility for the operations rested with Respondent No.2. Before opening of the centre he was advised to refer to all rules of Government/Regulating body for opening such centres. Attention is also drawn to circular of UGC dated 01.09.2011 which stated that it had come to the notice of the UGC that some of the State Private Universities have affiliated colleges and started campus centres in violation of the  UGC (Establishment of and Maintenance of Standards in Private Universities) Regulation, 2003 and against the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Prof. Yash Pal & Ors. Vs. State of Chhattishgarh & Ors. Some of these Universities are running centres on franchise basis also which is not allowed. As seen from the above, Respondent No.2 had been running this institute and invited applications for admission through advertisement without completion of necessary formalities for running the institute and thereby cannot be termed as an educational institution duly authorized to impart education/knowledge. By means of false advertisement, the Respondents have enticed students to pay heavy fees and seek admission in their institution. Learned Counsel for the Respondents could not provide any document showing due recognition of the institute imparting any technical or engineering education. No evidence has been produced showing that the institute was recognized by AICTE or UGC etc. accruing legitimate status to impart technical or engineering education and enrol students in engineering courses.
","8.       In view of the above, the District Forum rightly observed that such an institute must be dealt with heavy hand as they cheat the applicants wasting their valuable money, time and career. In the result, Revision Petition is allowed, order passed by the State Commission is set aside and that of the District Forum is upheld. There will be no order as to cost.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents booked residential plots with the petitioner company in a project, namely, ‘TDI City’, which the petitioner company is developing in Kundli in Haryana. Allotment letters were issued to the complainants pursuant to the bookings made by them. The price of each plot was agreed at about 17 lakhs. The complainants were also required to pay External Development Charges in addition to the price of the plot. The said External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the allotments were made to the complainants. The allotment letters came to be issued to the complainants on 7.1.2006. The payment plan was incorporated in Schedule-1 annexed to the application whereby the bookings were made. The payment plan filed by the complainants is at variance with the payment plan filed by the petitioner company.  Neither the payment plan filed by the complainants is signed on behalf of the petitioner company nor is the payment plan filed by the petitioner signed by the complainants. However, as per both the payment plans referred hereinabove, 60% of the payment was to be made at the timed of booking.
2.      The case of the complainants is that since the payment plan annexed by the petitioner company to the allotment letters was different from the payment plan which they had agreed to, they wrote several letters to the petitioner to correct the payment plan, enable them to make payment accordingly, but no response to the said letters was forthcoming from the petitioner company.
3.      Vide letters dated 29.7.2010, the petitioner company informed the complainants that the plots were ready for possession and the complainants were requested to make payment as per the Statement of Account annexed to the said letter within 15 days. No reply to the said letter was given by the complainants nor did they make any payment in terms of the demand raised by the petitioner company. After sending reminder to the complainants, the allotments were cancelled vide letter dated 11.12.2010 on the ground that the complainants had not cleared the outstanding dues.
4.      On cancellation of the allotments, the complainants wrote letters dated 24.12.2010 to the petitioner seeking waiver of the interest on the ground that the petitioner had not sent the correct payment plan to them. The cancellation having not been revoked, the complainants approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints seeking possession of the allotted plots on payment only of the External Development Charges which the petitioner had earlier demanded from the complainants with interest and which the complainants had failed to pay. They disputed liability to pay any interest on the External Development Charges.
5.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company which took a preliminary objection that the District Forum did not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the consumer complaints. On merits, the allotment made to the complainants as well as the payment received from them was admitted. It was, however, alleged that the complainants having defaulted in making payment of the balance sale consideration and External Development Charges, the allotments had rightly been cancelled.
6.      The District Forum vide its order dated 13.2.2013 directed the complainants to deposit the External Development Charges and also directed the petitioner to hand over the physical possession of the plots subject to the complainants paying the balance payment alongwith interest @ 9% p.a. from the due date till the date of payment.
7.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission  by way of separate appeals. The State Commission  having dismissed the appeals, the petitioner company is before this Commission. The order passed by the District Forum was not challenged by the complainants.
8.      The first submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner company is that the complainants are members of the same family, Shri Sukhmal Jain  being the father of Shri Dinesh Jain. She also submits that Shri Rajesh Jain brother of Mr. Dinesh Jain had also booked two plots in this very project and thus the family had booked six plots with the petitioner company in the same very project, two plots each having been booked by Shri Sukhmal Jain, Dinesh Jain and Rajesh Jain. She also submits that booking of as many as six plots by the members of the same family by itself would indicate that the bookings were made for speculative purposes and not for the purpose of constructing houses on the plots booked by them since the members of the same family were not likely to construct six different houses. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Commission in Kavita Ahuja Vs. Shipra Estate Ltd. & Jai Krishna Estate Developers Pvt. Ltd. & Connected Matters CC No.137 of 2010, CC No.145 of 2010 and CC No. 146 of 2010, decided on 12.02.2015
9.      On a perusal of the written version, I find that no such plea was taken by the petitioner before the District Forum. In the absence of pleadings to this effect, the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be entertained though the said contention was raised before the Forum in the written arguments filed before the District Forum. However, the fact remains that this plea was not taken either in the written version or in the evidence filed before the District Forum. Had such a plea been taken in the written version, the complainants would have got an opportunity to explain as to why the family members had booked as many as six plots in the same project. It is not as if a family can never require six plots in the same project. In a given case, the family may be large enough to require six houses for the residence of its members. Unless an opportunity is given to the complainants to explain the bookings made by them, it would be difficult to hold that they were not consumers with the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the C.P. Act.
10.    As regards the pecuniary jurisdiction in terms of Section 11 of the C.P. Act, the District Forum had pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain a consumer complaint where the value of the goods  purchased or the services hired or availed as the case might be, did not exceed Rs.20 lakhs. In these matters, the basic price of the plot was less than Rs.20 lakhs in each allotment. Though the External Development Charges were payable in addition to the basic price of the plot, the quantum of the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the allotment was made and that is why the amount of the said charges was not mentioned in the allotment letters. As held  by a three-Members Bench of this Commission dated 7.10.2016 in CC No.97 of 2016 -  Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.,  the value of the services in such a case would mean the sale consideration agreed to be paid by the buyer to the seller. Since the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the booking was made or even by the time the allotment letters were issued, it cannot be said that the complainants had agreed at the time of booking/allotment, to pay more than Rs.20 lakhs for each plot. The External Development Charges could eventually be less than the charges the petitioner has later claimed from the complainants. Had the EDC been substantially less, the aggregate of the Basic Sale Price and EDC would not have exceeded Rs.20 lacs. What has to be seen is that the definite consideration which the complainants had agreed to pay to the petitioner company at the time the booking / allotment was made in these matters.  Since the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by that time, it would be difficult to say that the complainants had to pay Rs.20 lakh each for each plot at the time the bookings/allotments were made. In any case, if two views in the matters are possible, the view which favours the complainants needs to be taken the provisions of the C.P. Act being primarily for protecting the interest of the consumer. In any case, this Commission, in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, will not be justified in interfering with the orders passed by the Fora below on this ground, in the facts and circumstances noted hereinabove since no failure of justice is shown to have happened on account of the consumer complaints having been entertained by the District Forum.
11.    Coming to the merits of the matters as noted earlier, two contradictory payment plans have been filed by the parties. The payment plan as noted earlier was Schedule-1 to the applications submitted by the complainants for booking the plots. The original applications were never produced by the petitioner before the District Forum though the petitioner was bound to be in its possession. Moreover, the conduct of the complainants in regularly writing to the petitioner and complaining of the change of the payment plan coupled with complete silence on the part of the petitioner in this regard clearly indicates that the payment plan filed by the complainants was correct and that is why the petitioner did not file the original applications before the District Forum nor did it controvert the letters received from the complainants in this regard.
12.    The booking was made by the complainants in August, 2005. The possession to the complainants was offered for the first time vide letter dated 29.7.2010, almost five years after the booking was made. Though even as per the payment plan relied upon by the complainants, 90% of the sale consideration was to be paid within one year of the allotment and admittedly there was default in making such payment, the complainants having not paid any amount after the initial payment constituting 60% of the basic sale price, the allotment was never cancelled by the petitioner which condoned the said default by offering possession of the allotted plots to the complainants on 29.7.2010. Moreover, the petitioner company never corrected the payment plan which it had annexed to the allotment letters though the said payment was different from the payment plan to which the complainants had agreed. Though the complainants did not make payment in terms of the letter dated 29.7.2010, the plots allotted to them are stated to be still available since this Commission vide its interim order dated 11.12.2013 had stayed the execution of the impugned order subject to the petitioner maintaining status quo in respect of the plots allotted  to the complainants. The District Forum has already directed payment of interest @ 9% p.a. on the balance sale consideration w.e.f. due date till the date of payment. Considering that (1) the petitioner itself had condoned the earlier default on the part of the complainants by offering possession to them as late as 29.7.2010 (2) the petitioner never came forward to correct the payment plan annexed to the allotment letters and (3) the possession came to be offered after as many as five years of the booking, the complainants in my opinion, should not be deprived of the possession of the allotted plots. The petitioner company has nothing to lose by delivering possession of the allotted plots to the complainants since it would be getting appropriate interest on the balance dues w.e.f. the date due date till the date of payment, in terms of the order passed by the District Forum and maintained by the State Commission. It would also be appropriate to note here that no compensation for the delay in offering possession has been awarded to the complainants, though the plots were offered after about five years.
","13.    It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Fora below were not justified in refusing interest on the amount of External Development Charges to the petitioner company. I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complainants having withheld the External Development Charges, they must pay interest on the said charges to the petitioner company, even if there was not specific agreement between the parties to pay interest on those charges. The complainants had agreed to pay the External Development Charges at the time the plots were booked by them. The said charges were not paid by them. Thus the amount of the External Development Charges was withheld and utilized by the complainants for their purposes. There is no good reason as to why they should not pay interest on the amount so withheld by them. The revision petitions are, therefore, disposed of in terms of the following directions:-
(i)      The External Development Charges as demanded by the petitioner company shall be paid to it by the complainants.
(ii)      In addition to the External Development Charges, the complainants shall also pay proportionate interest on the External Development Charges if such an interest was actually paid by the petitioner to the concerned authority. The amount of the proportionate interest shall be conveyed to the complainants within four weeks from today and shall be paid by them within eight weeks thereafter.
(iii)     The complainants shall also pay simple interest on External Development Charges @ 9% p.a. w.e.f. the date on which the said charges were paid by the petitioner to the Government till the date on which the charges are actually paid to the petitioner company.
(iv)    The balance principal amount shall be paid to the petitioner company in terms of the order passed by the Fora below.
(v)     The possession of the allotted plots shall be delivered to the complainants within four weeks of the complainants complying with this order.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant M/s Goodwill Leather Art had taken credit facility from the respondent State Bank of Mysore.  For the year 2007-08, the above-said bank had taken an insurance policy for the benefit of the complainant and the said policy covered risk against fire as well as risk against burglary, which according to the learned counsel for the bank was taken by them as per the instructions of the complainant. For the year 2008-09, no policy covering risk against burglary was issued by the insurer – National Insurance  Co. A  burglary happened in the factory of the complainant in which goods worth Rs.884337/- were allegedly stolen. The matter was reported to the police as well as to the bank. The bank was asked by the complainant to take necessary steps to get the insurance claim paid. No claim was lodged by the complainant directly with the insurer. The insurer did not pay the claim claiming that no insurance policy against burglary had been obtained from them for the year 2008-09. Since nothing was paid to the complainant, they filed a consumer complaint impleading the insurer as well as the bank as parties to the complaint.
2.      The complaint was resisted both by the insurer as well as by the bank. In its written version, the bank took the stand that they had requested the insurer to issue policy covering the risk of fire as well as of burglary but the insurer refunded the excess premium after two months and 10 days and did not cover the risk against burglary. The insurance company denied having received any instructions from the bank for issuance of a policy covering the risk of burglary. The case of the insurer was that they had received instructions from the bank through an agent for issuance of a policy against the risk of fire and had issued the policy accordingly.
3.      The District Forum vide its order dated 22.2.2012 directed the insurer to pay a sum of Rs.442169/- to the complainant alongwith compensation quantified at Rs.10,000/- and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs.5,000/-. Interest @ 9% p.a. was also awarded if the amount was not paid within 45 days. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the insurer approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order 31.7.2012, the State Commission allowed the appeal and set aside the order passed by the District Forum. Being aggrieved, the complainant is before this Commission by way of this revision petition.
4.      The learned counsel for the complainant has drawn my attention to a letter dated 21.2.2009 sent by the Chief Manager of State Bank of Mysore to the insurer. The aforesaid letter to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
“(a) Premium of Rs.2107.00 was deposited with you alongwith other accounts for covering Rs.10.00 lacs for the above account.
b) Again on 06.12.2008, we had deposited Rs.4216.00 towards above account for covering additional limit of Rs.10.00 lacs, i.e., totally for Rs.20.00 lacs for Fire and Burglary alongwith other accounts as calculated by your representative Smt. Suman Bhattacharya.
c) Till today we have not received the policy for any of the account deposited that day.
d) In the meantime, the account holder reported that there was theft in his factory/premises on 15.2.2009 night. The same has already been informed to your office on 16.2.2009 by the beneficiary in person.
e) We forward herewith his letter Police Complaint (FIR) copy and request you to settle the claim immediately and also send us the copy of policies for the account and all other accounts for which premium paid on 6.12.2008.”
It is evident from the aforesaid letter that the bank had deducted the premium which could cover risk against fire as well as against burglary from the account of the complainant and according to the bank it  had requested the insurer to issue a policy covering the risk against fire as well as against burglary. The onus was upon the bank to prove that it had actually requested  issuance of a policy which covered the risk against fire as well as against burglary. But,  the evidence on record is to the contrary. The affidavit of Shri Yoginder Paul, Manager of the National Insurance Co. would show that  no proposal form was received from the bank for issuance of a policy in the name of the complainant. The affidavit also shows that as per the instructions of IRDA, if a proposal is not obtained from the insured,  the information given by the insured is to the recorded by the concerned agent or Development Officer in the cover note or otherwise and the policies are issued accordingly on the basis of such recorded information. The affidavit also shows that normally the polices are taken by the banks with respect of stock of various borrowers which are hypothecated to them and such policies are issued as per the instructions given by the bank. Normally the proposal forms are not submitted by the banks which give instructions either to the company or to the agent and such information is recorded. The affidavit shows that the banks normally give a consolidated cheque for various policies. This is also stated in the affidavit that State bank of Mysore had not been submitting the proposal form so far as its Rash Behari Branch was concerned. As per the affidavit,  one Ms. Suman  Bhattacharya agent was communicating  with the bank for collecting premium and delivery of policy documents. As per the instructions given by the bank to her and forwarded by her to the insurer, a fire policy and burglary policy was issued for the year 2007-08. However for the year 2008-09, the bank did not give any instructions for issuing a burglary policy and  it was for this reason that the burglary policy was not issued  and only a fire policy was issued for the period from 28.7.2008 to 27.7.2009 against a consolidated premium received from the bank in respect of 12 insurance covers.
5.      The affidavit of Smt. Suman Bhattacharya has also been filed by the insurer. The said affidavit fully corroborates the case of the insurer. In her affidavit she had stated that she was an interlink between the bank and the insurance company and that no proposal forms were given to her by Rash Behari Branch of State Bank of Mysore. According to her, no  instructions or proposal  for insurance policy alongwith cheques of premiums was received. She has stated in her affidavit that the premium of Rs.56519/- paid by State Bank of Mysore included a sum of Rs.2108/- towards fire insurance to be issued in the name of State Bank of Mysore, A/c of the complainant. She also stated that there was no burglary policy on the date of enhancement  of Rs.10 lakhs to Rs.20 lacs from  December 2008 and no proposal or instructions  was received from the bank  for the burglary policy.
6.      Despite  the agent having clearly stated in favour of the insurer and against the bank, no attempt was made by the bank to impeach her testimony by her cross-examination. Even a request  for her cross-examination by the bank was not made. Therefore, her affidavit remains practically unrebutted. The deposition of the agent and the insurance officer leaves no doubt that no instructions by the bank were given for issuance of burglary policy despite premium payable for insurance cover against burglary, having been debited  in the account of the complainant. Therefore, there was a deficiency on the part of the bank in rendering services to the complainant in as much as the bank did not request the insurer to issue a policy which would cover burglary despite the bank having debited the premium to the account of the complainant. Since no oral instructions were received by the insurer for issuance of the policy covering the risk of burglary, the State Commission was fully justified in dismissing the consumer complaint against the insurer.
7.      Since the bank was deficient in rendering services to the complainant it has to reimburse the complainant for the amount which the complainant would have received from the insurer had a policy covering the risk of burglary being taken by the  complainant. It is therefore, directed that the amount awarded by the District Forum shall be paid to the complainant by respondent No.3 State Bank of Mysore which has since been merged with the State Bank of India and not by the insurer. The payment in terms of this order shall be made within two months from today failing which, it shall carry interest in terms of the order of the District Forum.
At this stage, the learned counsel for the bank  submits that the copies of the affidavits of the insurance officer and the agent were not supplied to them. Such a plea cannot be allowed be raised at this stage of revision and therefore is rejected.
","8.      The revision petition stands disposed of.

","C.VISWANATH
1. The Complainant i.e. M/s Orion Conmerx Pvt. Ltd.  is an ISO 9001 certified company in the business of export of leather bags, wallets, jackets etc. for reputed brands. The Complainant states that the Complainant has been continuously taking insurance cover for Stocks, Plant and Machinery and Building etc. Except for the fire incident, for which the present Consumer Complaint was filed, the Complainant had never lodged any claim whatsoever with the Opposite Party/insurance company. From the year 2001-02 to 2010-11, the Complainant paid approximately Rs.70 lakhs insurance premium to the Opposite Party. The Complainant took insurance cover by “Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy” for Stock, Plant & Machinery and Building from the Opposite Party, besides other cover including  Burglary, Group Medi-claim, Group Personal Accident, Worker’s Welfare Insurance –Group, Transit Insurance valid from 19.06.2010 to 18.06.2011 by paying a sum of Rs.12,53,545/-. The sum assured against peril of fire for stocks, vide policy No.360901/11/10/3400000095, for a premium (inclusive of tax) of Rs.4,69,547/- was Rs.24 Crores at three locations i.e. 90 Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon, 101 Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon and C-25 Khanpur, Delhi. An additional coverage of Rs.3 crores was taken by paying an additional premium (inclusive of tax) of Rs.42,732/-. The sum assured against peril of fire for Plant and Machinery, vide Policy No. 360901/11/10/3400000092, for a premium (inclusive of Tax) of Rs.41594/- was Rs.2.00 Crores at 90 Udyog Vihar and sum assured against peril of fire for Building, vide Policy No. 360901/11/10/3400000093 for a premium (inclusive of tax) of Rs. 59,562/- at 90 Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon was Rs.3 Crores.
2.       Statutory stock audit was conducted by Canara Bank’s panel auditor M/s Gupta & Bagaria between August 27, 2010 to August 30, 2010 who certified that a total stock of approximately Rs.26.46 crore was held by the Complainant, out of which raw materials and consumables accounted for Rs.14.65 crores, Work in Progress for Rs.6.35 crores and Finished Goods for Rs.6.35 Crores approximately.
3.       On 25.09.2010, fire broke out at about 8:30 a.m. at 90 Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon unit of the Complainant. The same was immediately reported to the Police and Haryana Fire Bridage Service, Gurgaon. The Complainant informed its customers about the incident of fire in which their orders under production got destroyed and sought extension of time to fulfil its contractual obligations. However, many customers did not oblige and cancelled their orders. The total value of the damaged goods being produced as per the orders of the companies was Rs.1,72,88,452/- (at the exchange rate of 1 US $ = Rs.44), out of a total loss of Rs.2,65,75,647/-. On 15.10.2010, the Complainant submitted Fire Claim Form for an amount of Rs.3,51,52,412/-. Along with the Claim Form the Complainant also submitted a detailed report of M/s Aura, Architects & Designers, who estimated the loss on account of civil works to be Rs.19,98,853/- ; on account  of Furniture and Fittings to be Rs.353,893/-; on account of Plant and Machinery to be Rs.21,12,069/-; on account of construction and interior design of Showroom to be Rs.25,00,000/- and Rs.16,11,950/- on account of Electrical Works amounting to a total of Rs.85,76,765/-. The Complainant had also submitted details of the orders cancelled by its customers on account of fire as stated above.
4.       On 07.10.2010, Preliminary Survey Report was submitted by M/s Rakesh Kapoor & Co. Final Survey Report was submitted on 30.03.2011. The Opposite Party repudiated the claim of the Complainant, vide letter dated June 14, 2011. The Complainant commissioned Tarun Gandhi & Co. Chartered Accountants to independently certify and verify loss to stock suffered by the Complainant on account of fire based on records submitted to the insurance company and other public documents like VAT return, Audited Balance Sheet, Stock Statements submitted and acknowledged by Banks, ROC Return etc. On 05.01.2012, Tarun Gandhi & Co. Chartered Accountants, submitted their report stating that the average stock held by the Complainant at any point of time during 12 months prior to the month of fire i.e. September 2010 was Rs.19,39,61,846/- and that the Complainant on account of fire suffered loss of Rs.2,45,16,913/-, subject to a marginal variation of 1% to 2% on account of fire pertaining to stock.
5.       The preliminary surveyor, Mr. Rakesh Kapoor of M/s Rakesh Kapoor & Co., vide e-mail dated 26.09.2010, directed the Complainant as follows: -
“Start cleaning of the premises, remove water spread on first and ground floor etc. and to place damaged stocks at secured place, may be at terrace floor for our further inspection.”
6.       In view of the aforesaid direction the entire analysis in para 11 (cause of loss) of the Final Survey Report becomes faulty. In fact the final surveyor sent an entirely contradictory e-mail on October 10, 2010 after the preliminary surveyor had already directed the Complainant to clear the debris. The final surveyor wrote in para 1.8 of his report that “during the first examination of the premises, substantial restrictions were imposed by the representative of the insured at the spot”. Preliminary Surveyor, however, in his report had not mentioned about any restriction, whatsoever placed. When preliminary surveyor had full access why would access be denied to the final surveyor during his very first visit is a relevant question.  After conducting the spot survey on the date of fire the preliminary surveyor, Mr. Rakesh Kapoor of M/s Rakesh Kapoor  & Co. opined  in his report that “fire originated from this section alone only and circumstantial evidence indicated electrical short circuiting as the most probable cause”. Through a process of specious reasoning for malafide reasons the final surveyor, who was not even present on the site on the date of fire, had given findings that were not only contrary to the report of the preliminary surveyor, but also perverse. While in para 11.3 of the Report, the final surveyor stated that “it is agreed with them (i.e. the preliminary surveyor) that the occurrence had its origin in the areas stated in their report” yet in para 11.19.42 he stated that “the three marks in the ceiling lead to the conclusion that there have been at least three sources of fire”. This was a flawed conclusion, as the final surveyor failed to take into account ventilation in his analysis. Ventilation is a critical factor for determination of fire origin and its behavior, although the final surveyor stated in his reply to interrogatories no. 2(b), that it had been taken into consideration, but there was no mention of it in the survey report, showing falsity of his reply. His report was therefore fundamentally flawed.
In conclusion Wikipedia sums up that:
“What these results also show is that fire investigators and the people who employ them need to be prepared to accept the reality that sometimes the best answer that can be obtained is ‘undetermined’ if either an accidental or an incendiary call is not supported by conclusive evidence”.
Unfortunately the final surveyor had not incorporated the aforesaid advice in his practice. Hence, the Complaint was filed.
7.       Alleging deficiency in service on the part of Opposite Party, Complaint was filed before this Commission under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, praying relief as under: -
Award a sum of Rs.3,30,93,678/- (Rs.2,45,16,913 towards loss of stock; Rs.85,76,765/- towards loss of Building (Civil Work, Showroom, Electrical Works), Furniture and Fittings and Plant& Machinery alongwith interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of fire to the date of payment, being the amount payable under policy Nos.360901/11/10/3400000092/93/95.
Direct the Opposite Party to pay a sum of Rs.25 Lakhs by way of compensation for hardships and suffering caused to the Complainant.
Direct the Opposite Party to pay cost of Rs.7,00,000/- being Advocates fees and other for pocket expenses.
Pass such other and further orders as this Hon’ble Commission deems fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case.
8.  The Complaint was contested by the Opposite Party by filing Written Statement in which it was contended that the Complainant had taken Standard Fire and Perils Policy in respect of stocks, plant and machinery and building which was subject to certain terms and conditions.
","On 25.09.2010, fire broke out in the insured premises and the matter was reported to the police on the same day, who entered the report in DD No.26. In the report the insured stated that the fire was extinguished completely in about 3 hours.  On 29.10.2010, the fire service submitted their report clearly stating that the reasons for the fire could not be detected. On the matter being reported, the insurance company appointed Rakesh Kapoor & Company for preliminary survey and they submitted a preliminary survey report on 07.10.2010. The surveyor also took photographs of the site and compiled them in a CD. The Respondent Company at the same time appointed Mr. P.S. Ramanathan, Surveyor to assess the loss, who visited the premises on 01.10.2010. During the first visit of the premises, substantial restrictions were imposed on the surveyor by the representative of the insured present at the spot and information available in their computer system was not allowed to be accessed. The surveyor was permitted a cursory examination of the premises and an examination of the entire block was permitted only on 05.10.2010. The other two locations covered under the stock policy floating across these were not allowed to be inspected. On 15.10.2010, the Complainant submitted the claim form for Rs.3,51,52,412/-. The surveyor submitted his report on 30.03.2011. Although the surveyor had assessed the loss of stocks at Rs.26,93,850/-, building at Rs.13,89,187/-, plant and machinery at Rs.5,60,068/- and Rs.24,500/- towards electrical fittings, but was of the opinion that no accidental fire had occurred and the available evidence showed the manifestation of multiple sources. On receipt of the report of the surveyor, the claim was repudiated by the Respondent Company, vide letter dated 14.06.2011. The claim of the Complainant had been rightly repudiated under Condition No. 6 of the Policy, which provided that the insured shall produce and give the insurance company all particulars, proof, information etc. in respect of the claim and the origin of cause of loss and the circumstances under which the loss or damage occurred. The said condition clearly stated that no claim under this policy shall be payable, unless the terms of these conditions had been complied with. The surveyor contended in his report that he was not permitted to carry out inspection and verification at the time of his first visit. This fact was brought to the notice of the Complainant, vide e-mail dated 02.10.2010 and there was no rebuttal from the Complainant to the said facts. Further, no suggestion was put to the surveyor, in the interrogatories served on him, that the said observations were not correct. With regard to the fact that the quantities of assets claimed to have been lost, the surveyor reported that the same were not supported by any documents as was required under Condition No. 6 of the policy. It was further stated that under Condition No. 6 of the policy it was for the insured to give the cause of loss and also substantiate the same by documentary evidence. As stated above, in the claim form submitted by the Complainant, the cause of fire was stated to be “unknown”. In the report of Fire Brigade Services also the cause of fire was not mentioned and rather it was stated that the “reasons for the fire could not be detected at the site”. It was further submitted that the Complainant at no point of time ever disclosed either to the surveyor or to the respondent insurance company the cause of fire. As a matter of fact the complainant was only relying upon observations made by the preliminary surveyor in para 5.5 of his report that fire originated from this section only and circumstantial evidence indicate electric short circuit as the most probable cause. The preliminary surveyor had only made preliminary observations and had not investigated into the matter as to the cause of fire as the same was to be done by the final surveyor. Mr. Rakesh Kapoor in his affidavit filed before this Hon’ble Commission had deposed that he had not arrived at any conclusion as he had not investigated the matter in depth and had no opportunity to examine the premises at close quarters after removal of debris and therefore, had given the probable cause as a generic possibility. On the contrary, the final surveyor had dealt in detail in regard to the cause of loss in the survey report and concluded that the loss was not accidental. The observation of Mr. Ramnathan, Surveyor was supported by his affidavit filed before this Commission. From the above findings and observations of the surveyor it was amply clear that the Complainant could not substantiate the cause of fire as also the quantum of loss and, therefore, had not complied with Condition No. 6 of the Policy. It was submitted that the final surveyor before releasing his report, sent a letter to the Complainant on 04.03.2011 to explain his point of view to the observations of the surveyor, both with regard to the cause of fire as well as the extent of loss and the same was not replied by the Complainant. As such adverse inference had to be taken against the Complainant. It was further submitted that the surveyor, on the basis of the records provided by the Complainant, had assessed the gross loss at Rs.61,39,539/- but clearly stated in his report that the claim was not admissible and recommended “No loss having been suffered within the terms of terms, condition, exceptions of the insurance policy disclosed by the insured, no liability will accrue upon the insured in any manner whatsoever on account of the reported occurrence.” That the Complainant had not filed on record any documentary evidence to support the quantum of loss. The Complainant had filed the affidavit of Rakesh Ahuja, Proprietor of M/s Aura Architects & Designer to prove the estimate of loss of building, plant & machinery, furniture and fittings etc. The estimate of repair cannot be treated as assessment of loss and further the deponent being an architect was not competent to give estimate for plant & machinery. No bill of repairs has been filed. As regards the loss of stocks, the Complainant had filed the affidavit of Mr. Tarun Gandhi, Chartered Accountant who proved his valuation report, which again cannot be said to be an assessment report and the perusal of the same would show that it was self-serving report to favour the Complainant. It was, therefore, prayed that the Complaint be dismissed with costs. The Insurance claim was repudiated, vide repudiation letter dated 14.06.2011, for the following reasons: -
“a. The nature of damages does not support the manifestation of an occurrence which can be reasonably and otherwise sustainably concluded as an occurrence within the terms, conditions and exceptions of the polices.
b. No insured peril has manifested in a manner causing an admissible loss within the terms, conditions and exceptions of the policy.
c. The quantity of assets that have been claimed as ‘lost’ does not stand supported by the physical evidence and documents.
d. No documents of any sort could be provided by you in support of the existence of the quantities claimed at the affected location, either collectively as a class of assets or individually in relation to the claim submitted by the insured.
e. No evidence in support of accidental fire has been found by the surveyor.”
9.       Heard the learned Counsel for the Complainant as well as the Opposite Party and also carefully perused the record. On the basis of report of the Surveyor the Opposite Party/Insurance Company repudiated the claim that the occurrence of fire was not accidental and supporting documents could be provided for the quantity claimed and no admissible loss had been suffered within the terms, conditions and exceptions of the Insurance Policy. The Complainant took insurance cover by standard fire and special perils policy for building, plant & machinery and stocks from the Opposite Party valid from 19.06.2010 to 18.06.2011. Fire broke out at one of the units located at 90, Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon of the Complainant at about 8.30 am on 25.09.2010. The same was immediately reported to the police and fire services and fire was controlled in about three hours. The Opposite Party/Insurance Company appointed M/s Rakesh Kapoor & Co., who submitted their preliminary survey report dated 07.10.2010. The Complainant submitted the claim for an amount of Rs.3,51,52,412/- on 15th October, 2010. The Final Surveyor, Mr. R.S. Ramanathan submitted his report on 30.03.2011.
10.     Preliminary surveyor opined that fire originated from a particular section and circumstantial evidence indicated that electrical short circuit was the most probable cause of fire. He advised the Complainant to start cleaning the premises, remove water on the ground and first floor and place the damaged stock at a secure place for further inspection. The final surveyor agreed with the occurrence of the fire as also the place where it originated, as mentioned by the preliminary surveyor. The only difference being that three marks in the ceiling led him to conclude that there have been at least three sources of fire. The Complainant states that final surveyor did not take into consideration the ventilation aspect. Based on the final report of the surveyor, the Opposite Party repudiated the claim of the Complainant, vide letter dated 14.06.2011, as violating condition 6 of the policy which provides that the insured shall produce and give to the insurance company all particulars in respect of the claim and origin of cause of loss and circumstances under which the loss or damaged occurred.
11.     The final surveyor report starts on a negative note that during his first visit to the premises substantial restrictions were imposed on the surveyor by the representative of the insured present at the spot and information available in their computer was not allowed to be accessed. He stated that five days later, on 05.10.2010 also he was only permitted cursory examination of the premises. This again does not appear to be convincing, as any party who has suffered loss and filed a claim would welcome the surveyor to their premises rather than not cooperate. On the other hand, the preliminary surveyor does not mention about any restrictions imposed during his visit. When the preliminary surveyor had access to the premises, there is no reason why a party who has filed a claim for loss would deny access to the final surveyor, whose report is very important in deciding the claim by the Insurance Company.
12.     The final surveyor did not establish the cause of fire. Simply denying that electric short circuit is not the cause of the fire is not sufficient. The final surveyor has also not conclusively established that it is not an accidental fire. No evidence has been placed on record to show that the Complainant or his staff have resorted to any mischief or caused fire with some ulterior motive. Merely based on observation of three marks on the ceiling, the final surveyor straight away jumped to the conclusion that there were at least three sources of fire. He did not give satisfactory reasoning for the same nor elaborate on three sources mentioned by him. On the other hand, the preliminary surveyor who had visited the scene of fire accident immediately, stated in his report that “fire originated from this section alone only and circumstantial evidence indicated electrical short circuiting as the most probable cause.” It is also to be seen that fire broke out in the morning hours when the staff had already reached the premises. If there was any mischief/malpractice on the part of the Complainant or on his behalf, it could have been done at unearthly hours, rather than in broad-day light in the presence of the staff. It is, therefore, not proved that the fire was not accidental in nature.
13.     The claim was repudiated also on the ground that documentary evidence had not been provided in support of the loss suffered by the Complainant. As seen from the report of the Surveyor about 4500 pages of documentary evidence had been submitted by the Complainant, which included the stock statement for the last six months, stock movement detail, cost sheets, trial balance dated 24.09.2010, profit and loss account dated 24.09.2010, balance sheet for the last three years-31.03.2008, 31.03.2009 & 31.03.2010, tax audit report for the last three years, auditor’s report for the last three years, outward and inward registers, police report, fire report, total loss detail, eye witness statements and purchase bills. Photographs have also been placed on record, which show the extensive damage to the premises with stocks.
14.     The Complainant also placed on record statutory stock audit conducted by Auditor M/s Gupta & Bagaria between 27th 30th August, 2010, who certified that the total stock held was approximately worth Rs.26.46 crores. Alongwith the claim form, the Complainant submitted report of M/s AURA, Architects & Designers, who estimated loss on account of Furniture and Fittings as Rs.353,893/-, Plant & Machinery at Rs.21,12,069/- and construction and interior design of showroom as Rs.25 lakhs, electrical works worth Rs.16,11,950/-, totaling to Rs.85,76,765/-. Tarun Gandhi & Co., Chartered Accountants, reported that the average stock held by the Complainant at any point of time during 12 months prior to the fire was Rs.19,39,61,846/- and the Complainant suffered loss of stock amounting to Rs.2,45,16,913/-, subject to a marginal variation of 1% to 2 %. From perusal of these documentary evidence submitted, it is not understood how the Surveyor came to the conclusion that no admissible loss has been suffered within the terms, conditions and exceptions of the insurance policies.
15.     Fire broke out in the premises of the Complainant and caused damage to the property. The Surveyor could not establish that the fire was not accidental and we consider the documentary evidence produced by the Complainant, supported by reports of the Bank Auditor, Architect and Chartered Accountant, adequate to assess the loss caused.         In fact, upon physical examination of the stocks and estimates furnished, the Surveyor did assess the loss at Rs.61,39,539/-.The assessment for furniture and fittings has been rightly excluded from the above assessment by the Surveyor, as no premium had been paid for the same. We see no grounds for repudiating the claim of the Complainant.
16.     The Complaint stands partly allowed and the Opposite Party is directed to pay a sum of Rs.61,39,539/- towards claim of the Complainant alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 9% p.a. with effect from the date of repudiation of the claim till realization, within eight weeks from the date of pronouncement of this order. There shall be no order as to costs.

","ORDER (ORAL)
1.      The present revision petition has been filed against the order dated 23.08.2018 in appeal of the petitioner/complainant against the judgement dated 30.11.2016.
2.      Admitted facts of the case is that the vehicle of the complainant was insured with the respondent and it met with an accident.  The surveyor reported that the vehicle was repairable.  However, the insurance company informed the complainant to get the vehicle repaired and submit the claim.  The complainant, however, approached the District Forum.  The District
-2-
Forum after taking on record, the written version of the respondent and evidences of the parties on record reached to the conclusion that the loss to the vehicle was total and gave the following directions :
“The complainant of the complainant is allowed against the opposite parties for Rs.5,00,000/-.  For that the complainant will give possession of the accidental vehicle to the opposite parties and the registration certificate will transfer in favour of the opposite parties on his expenses.  The order be complied within one month from the date of judgment.  The parties will bear their own costs of the case.”
The petitioner/complainant challenged this order before the State Commission wherein he claimed the interest on the amount ordered to be paid to him by the respondent and also claimed the garage charges at the rate of Rs.100/- per day.  In the appeal, the complainant also claimed the adjustment of the salvage value of the accidental vehicle in the amount granted by the District Forum.  After hearing the parties and re-appreciating and reassessing the evidences on record, the State Commission modified the order of the District Forum and issued the following directions :
“The appellant/complainant is liable to get total insured amount by giving salves of the vehicle to the respondent/opposite party but he has not given salves to the insurance company.  Thus he is not liable to get any interest on the insured sum.  But the insurance company has denied his claim on the illegal ground, due to reason such long time has been expend to get insurance claim.  Thus we are view of that the appellant/complainant is liable to Rs.75,000/- on one time from the respondent/opposite party.  In our opinion the judgment passed by the District Consumer Forum is required to modify.
-3-
On above ground the appeal is partly allowed and the respondent/opposite party is directed to pay Rs.75,000/- as compassion to the appellant/complainant along with judgment passed by the District Consumer Forum.”
3.      This order is impugned before me.  Learned counsel for the complainant/petitioner submits that complainant is ready to pay 25% as a salvage value of the accidental vehicle which the respondent can deduct from the amount of Rs.5 lakh payable by it to him.  As regards the contention of the complainant that he is entitled for the refund of the garage charges, he has failed to bring to my notice any agreement with the opposite party wherein the opposite party was liable to pay the garage charges to the petitioner.  It is argued on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner had not complied with all the directions of the District Forum and not handed over the damaged vehicle to them rather it had surrendered the vehicle with the transport department wherein he was paying Rs.100/- per day as garage charges.  It is submitted that opposite party was ready to take the damaged vehicle and there is no liability to pay the garage charges on them.
4.      Admittedly, the complainant had not complied with the directions of the District Forum and instead of surrendering the vehicle with RTO for registration, the same was surrendered only on 3.4.2017 while he was
directed to comply with the directions passed by the State Commission within one month i.e. by 30.12.2016.  It is further contended that this fact was also not brought to the notice of the State Commission.  In view of these facts and circumstance of the case, apparently, the complainant/petitioner is not entitled to any garage charges in the absence of any agreement with the opposite party.  Moreover, the vehicle was not kept with the opposite party but with the RTO.
","5.      The State Commission after perusing the entire record and re-appreciating and reassessing the record, reached to the conclusion that the complainant was entitled for a compensation of RS.75,000/-.  When compensation has been awarded, the complainant/petitioner is not  entitled for interest on the unpaid amount.  The present revision petition has no merit and the same is hereby dismissed.  The same stands disposed of with the direction that salvage money which is payable by the complainant shall be calculated at the rate of 25% of the total award amount i.e. of 5,00,000/- (Rupees Five lakh only) and that be deductible by the opposite party from the awarded amount.

","ORDER (ORAL)
1.      The present revision petition has been filed against  the order of the State Commission dated 22.3.2019 in appeal no.1283/2015 of the respondent challenging the order of the District Forum dated 30.7.2015 in consumer complaint No.434 of 2012 of the petitioner.
2.      In this case, the complaint of the petitioner was allowed by the District Forum and the State Commission in the appeal of the respondent slightly modified the order of the District Forum.
3.      Since the present revision petition has been filed with a delay of 206 days, the IA No.1959 of 2020 is moved for condonation of the said delay.
-2-
IA No.1959 of 2020 (Condonation of delay)
1.      The arguments are heard on this application.  It is argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the delay has occurred because the counsel had misplaced the file and it was not traceable till 31.08.2019.  After the petitioner received the file from the counsel after 31.08.2019, the revision petition was filed on 05.02.2020.   It is further submitted that petition could not be filed prior to this because the wife of the petitioner had fallen ill.
2.      It is a settled proposition of law that condonation of delay is not a matter of right and the applicant is required to give sufficient causes for such delay.  The refusal to condone the delay may affect a party adversely but it has to bear the rigour of the law, if it fails to give adequate/enough reasons which prevented him to approach within the period of limitation, the courts are not required to condone the delay on passionate grounds.  Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in the case of In the case of “Ram Lal and Ors. vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361”, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held that condonation of delay is not a matter of right and the Appellant has to show that they are entitled for
-3-
such condonation of delay by showing sufficient cause.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
","Para 12         “It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
3.      The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “R. B. Ramlingam vs. R. B. Bhavaneshwari, I (2009) CLT 188 (SC)”.  has clearly provided the guidelines which the courts need to fall while determining the question of reasonable or sufficient causes for delay.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under :
Para 5             ""We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
-4-
4.      In the case of “Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, (2011) 14 SCC 578,” while dealing with the Application for condonation of delay, it is held that the special nature of the Act, especially of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 wherein special period of limitation has been provided, shall also be kept in mind while dealing with such applications.  Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under :
Para 5      “It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Fora.""
5.      In the present case the only ground given for seeking condonation of delay is that, first of all the counsel lost the file and it could be traced only on 31.08.2019.  Even after receiving the file on 31.08.2019, the petition has been filed after expiry of period of limitation since it has been filed on 5.2.2020.  Reasons for such further delay is given that the wife of petitioner was seriously ill, however, no documents has been placed on record in spite of this contention.  I am not satisfied that the petitioner has sufficient
-5-
causes which prevented him from approaching this Commission with a period of limitation.  The application is hereby dismissed.
RP No.212-213 of 2020
Consequent upon, the revision petition is also dismissed being barred by limitation.

","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
Late Smt. Kaushalya Devi was insured under Janata Personal Accident Policy issued by the petitioner company for the period from 04.12.1997 to 08.12.2002.   She fell down from the stairs of the roof of her house on 18.12.1999.  Initially she was treated in Primary Health Care, followed by her treatment at S.K.M.C.H. Muzaffarpur.  A certificate of disability was issued to her by her treating Doctors being Dr. Rajeshwar Prasad Singh and Dr. Mani Bhushan Sharma.  The case of the complainant is that she continued to be on the bed and ultimately succumbed to the accidental injury on 03.2.2005.  A claim was lodged with the petitioner company for payment of the accidental benefits available under policy.  The petitioner company appointed one investigator Mr. Syed Akhtar Hussain, who submitted a report to the insurer, recommending that the claim was not acceptable for the reasons recorded in the report.
2.      Based upon the report of the investigator, the claim was repudiated by the insurer vide letter dated 29.3.2001, which reads as under:
“In connection with the above, we regret to inform you that on the basis of investigation report as well as papers produced by you it is found that your above noted claim is out of preview of the police.  Hence company has no liability and your claim stands repudiated.”
It would be pertinent to note here that initially the claim was lodged for payment of the benefits available in case of the accidental injury and the deceased injured died more than three years after the claim had been repudiated.
3.      The complainant thereafter approached the Hon’ble High Court of Patna by way of a Writ Petition.  The High Court having noticed the repudiation of the claim, felt that the proper Forum would be Consumer Forum or any other remedy that may be advised to the petitioner.  It was however, noticed by the High Court that no communication had been sent by Registered Post at the registered address of the petitioner.  The complainant thereafter approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.
The complaint was resisted by the petitioner company, which took a preliminary objection that the complaint was barred by limitation.  Issuance of the policy however, was admitted.  It was further stated in the written version that the claim was rightly rejected on the basis of the report of the investigator.
4.      The District Forum having dismissed the consumer complaint, the respondent / complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.
5.      Vide impugned order dated 17.12.2014, the State Commission allowed the appeal and directed the petitioner company to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-  to the complainant with 8% interest from the date of institution of the complaint.
6.      The first question which arises for consideration in this case is as to whether the deceased had died only on account of injury sustained by her in the accidental fall on 18.12.1999.  The complainant has filed several documents to prove the injuries suffered by the deceased on account of all from the stairs but has not filed any medical certificate, disclosing therein the cause of her death.  Even if the deceased had suffered serious injuries and had become permanently disabled during the fall on 18.12.1999, the possibility of she having died on account of some other reason cannot be ruled out.   This is more so when the death happened more than five years after the injuries were suffered by her.  The primary onus was upon the complainant to prove that the deceased had died solely on account of accidental injuries suffered by her on 18.12.1999.  The complainant has not been able to prove such a case.
7.      However, the insurance policy under which the deceased was covered was not confined to a case of death and also covered injuries if those injuries had resulted in her permanent total disablement.  Therefore, if the amount payable in case of death on account of accidental injuries was not payable, the amount which was payable in case of permanent total disablement due to accidental injuries would be payable to her.  If the amount payable in case of death and the amount payable in case of permanent total disablement were one and the same, the complainant would be entitled to that amount if a case of permanent total disablement is made out.  If a lesser amount was payable in case of permanent total disablement as compared to the amount payable in case of death, it is the lesser amount which would be payable to the complainant.
8.      The learned counsel for the complainant / respondent has drawn my attention to a certificate issued by the Deputy Superintendent of Sadar Hospital, Muzzafarpur and countersigned by the Superintendent of the said hospital, Sadar Hospital, Muzzafarpur is a Government Hospital.  The certificate to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“As per prescription made by MO Sadar Hospital Muzzafarpur, there is fracture of 1st lumber bone leading to disability in both the legs and so unable to perform her routine work.  As per prescription by eye surgeon there is secondary absolute Glaucoma in right eye.”
9.      The learned counsel for the complainant has also drawn my attention to another certificate purporting to be issued by the Medical Superintendent of Sadar Hospital and counter signed by Medical Superintendent, which reads as under:
“This is to certify that Kaushalya Devi aged about 61 years wife of Late Jagdambi Singh Vill. Gokkula, P.S. Paroo District Muzaffarpur.  History of pain in Lumber bone one #.  Due to failed from roofs stair leading fracture of spine reslbiers  in preraparesis of back lower limb tremor of both hands and she is blind with both eyes (P.T.G.O.) patient is permanently totally and absolutely disable. (emphasis supplied).
So she is dependent she is advised to have completed rest on hard bed.”
10.    It is evident from the above referred tow certificates issued by the Doctors of Sadar Hospital that the deceased had suffered permanent total disablement on account of the injuries suffered by her due to accidental fall on 18.12.1999       .  There is no medical evidence produced by the petitioner company to refute the medical record produced by the complainant and therefore, there is no reason to disbelieve the certificate issued by the Doctors of a Government hospital.  This is more so, considering that the complainant comes from a poor strata of the society the deceased being an insured under the Janata Personal Accident Policy.  Therefore, the complainant is entitled to payment of such amount as was payable in case of permanent and total disablement.
","11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the revision petition is disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      The petitioner company shall pay such amount to the complainant as was payable under the Janata Personal Accident Policy issued to the deceased, in a case of the total permanent disablement.
(ii)      The petitioner shall also pay simple interest @ 8% per annum on the principal amount payable to the complainant in terms of this order with effect from the date of institution of the complaint till the date of payment.
(iii)     The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today.

","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant is a partnership firm engaged in manufacture  and sale of gems and jewellery, obtained a Marine insurance cover from United India Insurance Co. Ltd.-  appellant in FA/645/2012 and respondent No.1 in FA/550/2012,  for export of gold and  precious jewellery to London. The consignment of jewellery was sent by the complainant to London through FedEx Express, respondent No.2 in both the appeals, but the consignment was lost in its transit did not reach its destination. The loss of the consignment was admitted by the carrier which maintained that as per the terms and conditions agreed by it with the consignor, its liability was restricted to US$ 500.
2.      Being aggrieved from the refusal by the insurer to pay the claim amount, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission  by way of a consumer complaint, impleading the insurer as well as the carrier as the opposite parties in the complaint.
3.      In its written version, the carrier admitted the shipment of the jewellery as well as the loss of the consignment during transit and stated that a certificate dated 16.12.2019 had been issued by it to the complainant with respect to the loss of the consignment. The carrier reiterated that its liability for the loss during transit was restricted to US$ 500.
4.      The insurer resisted the complaint primarily on the ground that the executive of the carrier did not cooperate with the settling agent appointed by them and the settling agent was not allowed to visit the hub of the carrier at Paris.
5.      The State Commission  vide its impugned order dated 1.8.2012 directed as under:-
“We allow the complaint and direct the opposite party no.1 to compensate the loss to the complainant as per policy conditions (CIF + 10% ) within two months of this order. The complainant is also entitled for Rs.50,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.10,000/- as cost of prosecution.”
6.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission , the insurer is before this Commission by way of FA/645/2012. Since the complainant is also aggrieved on account of interest having not been awarded to it by the State Commission , the complainant is also before this Commission by way of FA/550/2012.
7.      The learned counsel for the insurer has drawn my attention to the following terms of the insurance policy and has submitted that requisite documentation was not provided to them by the complainant:-
“Procedure In the event of Loss or Damage for which Underwriters may be liable.
LIABIIITY OF CARRIES, BAILEES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES
It is the duty of the Assured and their Agents, in all cases to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimize  a loss and to ensure that all rights against Carriers Bailees or other third parties are properly preserved and exercised in particular, the Assured or their Agents are required:-
1           To claim immediately on the Carriers, Port Authorities or other Bailees for any missing packages.
2           To apply immediately for survey by Carrier's or other Bailee's Representative, if any loss or damage be apparent and claim on the carriers or other Bailees for any actual loss or damage found at such survey.
3           In a circumstance, except under written protest, to give clean receipts where goods are in doubtful condition.
4           To give notice in writing to the Carriers or other Bailees within 3 days of delivery if the loss or damage was not apparent at the time of taking delivery.
Note: The Consignees or their Agents are recommended to make themselves familiar with the Regulation of the port Authority at the port of discharge.
SURVEY AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT
In the event of loss or damage which may involve a claim under this insurance immediate notice of such loss or damage should
be given to and a survey Report obtained from  Lloyd's Agents as below.
In the event of any claim arising under this insurance request for settlement should be made to who is/are authorized by United India Insurance Co. Ltd. to adjust and settle claims on behalf of the Company.
DOCUMENTAHON OF CLAIMS
To enable claims to be dealt with promptly the Assured or their Agent are advised to submit all available supporting documents
without delay, including when applicable :-
1           Original policy or certificate of Insurance.
2           Original or copy of shipping invoices, together with shipping specification and/or weight notes.
3           Original Bill of Lading and/or other contract of carriage.
4           Survey report or other documentary evidence to show the extent of the loss or damage. .
5           Landing account and weight notes at final destination.
6           Correspondence exchanged with the Carriers and other Parties regarding their liability for the loss or damage.”
8.      I have carefully perused the aforesaid Clause. No doubt the insured was under an obligation to make available all such documents as were in its custody and were necessarily required by the insurer for verification and assessment of the loss alleged to have been sustained by the complainant but, there is no evidence of any such document having not been made available by the complainant to the insurer. Clause 6 under the heading ‘Documentation of Claims’ required the complainant to share with the insurer the correspondence exchanged with the carrier  and other parties regarding the liability of the insurer for the loss or damage. There is no evidence of any such correspondence having been demanded by the insurer or its agent and having been denied by the complainant.
9.      The learned counsel for the Insurer has drawn my attention to the Email of M/s Robert Lyon & Co.  dated 17.6.2010 which to the extent it is relied upon by the learned counsel, reads as under:-
“Thank you for your e-mail the contents of which I note but would reiterate yet again my earlier comments that we have submitted all our findings in previous e-mails and cannot really see what else you expect us to achieve as FedEx admitted that the consignment was lost whilst in their care. We have tried to pursue  this matter further with FedEx in the United Kingdom but have received no response and attach hereto a copy of our latest e-mail to them.
At an early date I explained that we were informed that this matter needed to be pursued with FedEx in India but my mails to you in this regard have remained unanswered and I attach hereto my last communications dated 14 April and 10th of May 2010 both of which remain unanswered.”
In my opinion, the above-referred email does not in any manner show any non-cooperation on the part of the insured nor does it show any refusal on the part of the complainant to share any correspondence exchanged with the carrier or any other person with respect to the consignment in question. The settling agent who sent the aforesaid Email to the insurer clearly wrote that the FedEx had admitted the loss of the consignment while in their care. Para 3 of this email is important and reads as under:-
“It is my opinion that this loss has occurred and in the absence of being able to obtain access to FedEx's premises in Paris, which I do not believe will reveal much further information I cannot understand why the claim cannot be settled if it falls under the terms of the policy of Insurance. We have spoken to the receiver on many occasions and can confirm that he has been aggrieved for some time and I am surprised that he has not consulted solicitors before now.”
10.    It is evident from a due consideration of this Email that though the carrier M/s FedEx had not given access to its premises in Paris to the settling agent, it had expressly admitted the loss of consignment while in its custody and the settling agent had opined that the loss to the complainant had actually occurred.  Even with respect to access to the premises of the carrier in Paris, he was of the opinion that not much further information would be revealed from such access. He was of the opinion that the claim should be settled if it otherwise fell under the terms of the insurance policy. Therefore, this letter of the settling agent to the insurer does not show any non-cooperation on the part of the complainant and does not constitute breach of any term of the insurance policy. There was no way the complainant could have compelled M/s FedEx to give access its Paris premises to the settling agent of the insurer. The complainant could be expected to do only that much  which was in its power and reach. It was the decision of the carrier and not of the complainant to access to the Paris premises of the carrier was necessary for investigation of the claim or not. Even if the stand taken by the carrier was not correct, the complainant cannot be blamed for such a stand being taken by the carrier. Therefore, the insurer, in my opinion, was wholly unjustified in not settling the claim despite a specific finding given by the settling agent and the recommendation made by him to settle the claim.
","11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the complainant is entitled to payment in terms of the insurance policy. As far as interest is concerned, I see no justification for not awarding the same despite loss to the complainant having been clearly established. Therefore, the insurer should also pay interest @ 9% p.a. to the complainant on the principal amount payable to it under the insurance policy. However, separate compensation for mental agony will not be justified when interest is being awarded to the complainant. The cost of litigation award by the State Commission, however, was fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. The interest in terms of this order shall be payable w.e.f. the date of institution of the complaint till the date on which the payment is actually made. The complainant will execute the subrogation letter and other necessary documents in favour of the insurer before payment in terms of this order is made to it. The insurer will be entitled to avail all such remedies, as may be available to it in law, against the Carrier. The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today. Both the appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER HON'BLE MR. C. VISWANATH,MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :MR. AMIT KUMAR SINGH 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Tata AIG General Insurance Company Limited challenging the order dated 24.07.2019 passed by the Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Jaipur (in short the  State Commission) in first appeal  No. 304 of 2009.
2.     Brief facts of the case are that the respondent complainant got his truck insured for the period 31.12.2012 to 30.12.2013 with the petitioner insurance company. On 20.01.2013, a sudden sound came from the vehicle and the vehicle caught fire due to short circuiting which completely damaged the vehicle. Complainant immediately informed about the same to the insurance company and lodged a FIR also. Complainant took the vehicle to service center and got it repaired for Rs.19,33,150/-. The insurance company in January 2014 refused to give the claim amount stating that the complainant intentionally lighted the truck. Aggrieved, the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum and the District Forum allowed the complaint and directed the opposite party to pay the amount of Rs.17,47,783/- along with interest at the rate 9% per annum from 25.7.2014 apart from  Rs.25,000/- as compensation and Rs.5,000/- as cost of litigation. Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner insurance company preferred an appeal before the State Commission and the State Commission vide the impugned order dismissed the appeal of the opposite party.
3.     Hence, the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at the admission stage. He states that the fora below have not considered the report of the expert investigator appointed by the insurance company. He further states that the preliminary surveyor has not ruled out arson. The final surveyor has given a report in favour of the complainant assessing the loss on repair basis to be Rs.17,47,783/-. However, the expert investigator appointed by the insurance company has given a clear report stating that the reason of fire given by the complainant is not correct as there may be multiple reasons for such a fire and even arson is not ruled out. Learned counsel further states that the District Forum has not considered appropriately the report of the investigator observing that he visited the spot after 10 months, therefore, the correct finding cannot be arrived at. Both the fora below have accepted the report of the final surveyor and have allowed the amount of Rs.17,47,783/- along with interest @9% per annum from 25.07.2014. The State Commission has not considered the report of the expert investigator and has summarily rejected the appeal filed by the insurance company.
5.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and perused record. It is seen that both the fora below have given concurrent finding of facts and have not accepted the report of the expert investigator. Both the fora below have accepted the report of the final surveyor and the loss assessed by him. In fact, District Forum has observed the following in respect of the report of the Investigator:-
“The opposite party insurance company received the report of a forensic science expert about 10 months after the vehicle was set on fire, final survey conducted by spot surveyor and Shri Laxminarayan Vyas, Surveyor, not based on direct inspection dated 19.06.2013, and it is based on photographs taken and reports prepared. In such a situation, forensic science specialist Dr S R Singh’s report is of no special importance that the fire in the vehicle was not caused by an electric short circuit. The said expert has only expressed his opinion. There is no definite conclusion in his report as to what caused the fire. The opposite party also conducted ‘Insurance Auxiliary Services’ in relation to this fact, the report dated 06.03.2013 is obtained. In this report, the final conclusion that has been given after research, it has been mentioned that “own damage claim of the vehicle no. RJ 07 GB 1302 seems genuine and further vehicle owner told us that no one was injured in the said accident hence they have registered in the Daily Diary of police station Shri Dungarh”.
6.     It is also seen that the State Commission has also observed the following:-
“The contention of the appellant before the Forum below was that claim has not been arisen out of accident. Reliance has been placed on the opinion of Forensic report who has inspected the spot on 02.10.2013 whereas incident has taken place on 20.01.2013 meaning thereby that after about ten months of the incident spot was inspected and it is clear from the report that till then the vehicle was dismantle and only on the basis of the photographs of the vehicle opinion has been made which has rightly been considered and rejected by the Forum below. Per contra the investigator was of the opinion that damage is genuine one. In view of the above, the contention of the appellant is not acceptable. The forum below has rightly allowed the claim on the basis of assessment of the surveyor”.
7.     It is true that the report of the surveyor is not the final word however, there must be sufficient and cogent evidence to dismiss the same. Both the fora below have not relied upon the evidence and the proof relied upon by the expert investigator. This Commission cannot reassess the facts against the concurrent findings given by the fora below as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrs Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 2011 (3) Scale 654 wherein the following has been observed:-
“23.   Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
8.     In the present revision petition, we find that the petitioner has challenged mainly the findings based on the evidence by the fora below. In fact, we do not find any cogent and effective piece of evidence filed by the investigator to convince us to dismiss the report of the final surveyor. The learned counsel has emphasized on the credibility and expertise of the investigator, however, we are of the view that the decision is required to be based on the evidence.
9.     The District Forum has passed an order for paying the loss assessed by the surveyor viz Rs.17,47,783/- along with 9% per annum interest from 25.07.2014. We feel that in the present interest scenario, the interest of 9% per annum is on a high side, particularly when there is no express clause in the policy in this regard. Therefore, we deem it appropriate to reduce the rate of interest from 9% per annum to 6% per annum. We are conscious that we have not issued any notice to the respondent in this matter to save the parties from further litigating and from incurring further expenses in the litigation.
","10.   Based on the above discussion, we do not find any merit in the present revision petition. However, we reduce the rate of interest from 9% per annum to 6% per annum and we confirm the order of the District Forum with this modification. If the respondent feels aggrieved by this order, he can approach this Commission by filing a Miscellaneous Application in this revision petition. Accordingly, revision petition no.2360 of 2019 stands disposed of.
11.   Learned counsel for the petitioner is ready to deposit the entire amount as per this order with the District Forum within a period of four weeks from today. Hence, the District Forum shall not take any coercive action till four weeks. Obviously, this interim order will lapse at the end of the fourth week.

The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

ORDER
“It is the widespread adverse effects on farmer consumers at large noted because of unfair trade practice of promoting, getting distributed, falsely claiming and propagating high yield, in respect of untested, unapproved seeds.  It is necessary to make it a priority to have a framework regarding the accountability and improvisation in seed quality in future.”
1.       The revision petition has been filed under Section 21(b) of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 04.02.2015 of the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’ whereby the Appeal filed by seeds co. was allowed and the complaint was dismissed.
2.       In the instant case the petitioner is complainant and the respondent no. 1 is the Ankur Seeds Pvt. Ltd. (OP-5) and the respondent no. 2, Amravati Sahakari Shetkari Kharedi Vikri Samtee Ltd. is OP-3 and the OP-1 is President, OP-2 is Secretary and OP-4 is Administrator of OP-3 Samtee.
3.       Brief facts  are that the petitioner / complainant purchased  12 bags and 8 bags of cotton seeds of Ankur 651 lot No. 173 (5273 CS) and   lot No. 171 (7213 CS)  respectively on 15.06.1998 and 02.07.1998  from Amravati Sahakari Shetkari Kharedi / OP-3 and paid Rs.300/- for each bag ( total Rs.6000/-). The seeds were manufactured by Ankur Seeds Pvt. Ltd. / OP-5. The packets of seeds were giving assurance of 65 % germination of seedlings. But after sowing in 8 acres of irrigated land only 20 % to 30 % seeds had germinated. The complainant further alleged that   the lots printed on the bag were not as per the bill issued to him. Therefore he made a complaint to the Agricultural Officer, Zilla Parishad, Amravati on 15/07/1998 who visited his field and carried of the inspection and found that the germination of seeds was less than 25% to 30%. The OPs did not heed any concern to the complainant’s requests, thus being aggrieved the consumer complaint was filed in the District Forum, Amravati.
4.       The District Forum, after taking into account the averments of the parties vide Order dated 07.03.2007 partly allowed the complaint. It directed the Seed Co. to pay Rs. 15,000/- per Acre for 8.5 Acres of land towards compensation along with  interest @ 8 % p.a on the total amount from 17.08.1998 and Rs. 2,000/- as cost. The OP -1, being the Samiti dealing with sale and purchase of seeds was directed to deposit Rs. 5,000 towards fine for not complying the order dated 13.07.2001 & 28.07.2003. No order was passed against the remaining OPs i.e office bearers of the OP- 1.
The District Forum observed as:
4.7 The opposite party No.1 to 3 have falsely alleged that they have taken their seeds back given earlier to complainant and handed him over other seeds. However, since beginning, opposite party has failed to prove before this Forum as to which goods / Seeds are taken by company back and which goods/seeds are given to complainant in place of earlier seeds and, therefore, it is not just, proper, legal to held the opposite party’s allegations that lot number has changed due to exchange of seeds/ goods and it caused difference.
4.8. On 17.07.1998, Agriculture Officer and Seeds Inspector Panchayat Samiti, Amravati personally visited and inspected the Farm of the complainant and accordingly prepared their report dated/ -20.07.1998 and submitted to Agriculture Officer Zilla Parishad, Amravati. The Copy of the said report is filed on record. On perusal of the said report, it reveals that concerned Officers have mentioned in report that on inspector, there is 50 % germination in 6 Acres of Field/ Gut No. 68/1 of the complainant and there is 27 % germination in 2 Acres of Gut No. 18/2. There is 80 % germination in  neighbour’s foelds. Farmers have sown on 6th and 7th July and on 5th 6th and 10th July rain was recorded and at this juncture, it is submitted that it is clear that opposite party has provided Lot No. 5277 in place of 5238 and made changes while preparing the bill. It is just ,proper  and legal to held that complainant has sustained heavy financial loss due to less production took place because of non germination of cotton seeds sown by  the complainant, which were of let of inferior in quality and rate. There is sign and seal of the Agriculture Development Officer, Zilla Parishad, Amravati on the said report. The opposite party No. 1 to 3 and 5 has not challenged the said report, since beginning and it was necessary and proper to prove by substantial evidence that the said report was false, wrong, mis- directed and one sided but it is just, legal and proper to held that the said report filed on record is proper and admissible as nobody has actually challenged the report. The opposite party can not say that cotton seeds are not germinated due to natural calamities or can not take recourse of such statement and hence order passed.
(from para 4.7 and 4.8 the District Forum’s Order -the translated )
5.       Being aggrieved by the order of District Forum, the Seeds Co. - OP-5 appealed to the State Commission. The appeal was partly allowed vide Order dated 04.02.2015   and set aside the order of the District Forum. The State Commission made observations as below:
15. We perused the order passed by the Forum. We find that the Forum has not given proper reasoning as to the evidence brought on record and erred in treating report of the agricultural officer to be conclusive proof of inspection and sub standardness of the seeds. The Forum appears to have based its observations on the presumptions based on the reply given to notices by the appellant. They cannot be a ground to consider the seeds to be substandard. We also find that the Forum has granted unreasonable relief and hence, the order being not on sound reasoning deserves setting aside. Hence, we are inclined to set it aside.
(para 15 from the State Commission’s Order)
6.       Being aggrieved by the Order of the State Commission, the complainant approached this Commission.
7.       Heard the learned counsel for the both the sides and perused material on record.
8.       Admittedly, the seeds purchased by the Complainant were developed and promoted by the Seed Co. which claimed and propagated that its minimum germination would be 65 %.  However, the seeds were of very small in dimension, dried and some seeds had minor holes in them, in it prima facie evident that the seeds were of inferior quality. The seeds in question were also sent to the Government Seeds Laboratory. The reported on  24.06.1998 as  below:
---
REPORT
Our laboratory has done seeds experiment. It is found as under
Good seeds
Satisfied seeds but less germinating capacity
Proper for sale but requires purification as majority of seeds are of (Tanache) seeds
Type of seeds on the label seems false
Very little sample for correct analysis
Very sick
Very decayed
Unsatisfied seed hence improper for use
Proper for sale but needs purification due to excess garbage
Reported after re- checking
(emphasis supplied)
Less germinating capacity is a negative factor for a seed to transform into a full-fledged crop.  Apart from this pertinent to note that the OP-1 provided Lot No. 5277 instead of 5238 and the bill was manipulated. It amounts to unfair trade practice. In the instant case, promoting, getting distributed, falsely claiming and propagating high yield, in respect of untested, unapproved seeds, when nothing was known of its performance and other traits like grain yield, maturity period, disease and insect reaction, and which failed to yield the claimed and propagated produce, when, in the adjoining fields, at the same time, gave good / higher yield, was decidedly unfair and deceptive within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r).
9.       The State Commission held that the inspection report filed by the complainant was not a regular inspection report of the District Seeds Grievances Redressal Committee appointed by the Government of Maharashtra but was a letter written to Agricultural Development Officer by the Agricultural Officer, in which he has requested for the inspection of the field. Also there was no supportive evidence of any one to support the opinion given in that report. In my view the State Commission erred that the onus was on the manufacturer to prove the quality of seeds.  I would like to rely upon the judgments of the Apex Court in National Seeds Cooperation Ltd. v M. Madhusudhan Reddy, (2012) 2 SCC 506 and Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Co. Ltd. v Alavalapati Chandra Reddy, (1998) 6 SCC 738, to state that the onus to prove that the seeds manufactured are of good quality lies on the manufacturer as the farmers are not expected to store some of the seeds for future testing. Moreover, as per the Seeds Act, 1966 manufacturer is required to keep a small sample of each batch of seeds for a minimum period of time depending upon the nature of the seeds. Therefore, there was no reason for the petitioner to not have sent the seeds to a laboratory for testing as per Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act.
10.     Thus, it is clear that both, ‘deficiency in service’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(g) and (o) and ‘unfair trade practice’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) of the Act, are well and truly evinced against the Seed Co.
11.     The Consumer Protection Act,1986 is for “better protection of the interests of consumers”, in recognizably a fight amongst unequals. Its Statement of Objects and Reasons speaks of “speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes”. Considering that the failure of the crop took place in 1998 and its revision is being decided now in 2020 i.e. almost after two decades.
12.     Based on forgoing discussion the impugned order is set aside and the Order of the District Forum is affirmed and sustained.
13.     In addition, I deem it just and appropriate that Rs. 50,000/- shall be paid by the Seed Co. to the farmer/ Complainant towards cost of litigation in the revisional proceedings before this Commission (which took about 5 years).
14.     Towards this end, the Registry is directed to send a copy of this Order to the District Forum within seven days of its pronouncement.
","15.     The present Revision Petition is allowed.
15.     The present Revision Petition is allowed.

For the Respondent Nos.2 to 7:   Nemo (not served) 
","This appeal execution has been filed by the appellants Bajwa Developers Ltd. & anr. against the orders dated 14.06.2018 & 28.05.2018 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, (in short ‘the State Commission’) in EA No.117 of 2017 in CC No.138 of 2015.
2.      The complaint case was decided by the State Commission vide order dated 16.09.2016 and all the opposite parties were directed to pay Rs.20,00,000/- to the complainant.  The execution was filed by the complainant for implementation of the State Commission’s order and the State Commission finally passed the order dated 28.05.2018 whereby the appellant No.2 herein has been sentenced with two years imprisonment along with Rs.10,000/- as fine.  The appellant No.2 moved an application before the State Commission for suspension of the sentence, however the State commission dismissed this application vide its order dated 14.06.2018.The present appeal execution has been filed against order dated 28.05.2018 and order dated 14.06.2018 under Section 27A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  The matter was listed for final hearing on 19.09.2019.  The following order was passed on that day.
“None is present on behalf of the appellant.  Learned counsel for respondent no.1 is present, who states that the appellant has made payment to respondent no.1 as per the order of the State Commission and is nothing remains in the present appeal.
The matter is reserved for orders.”
3.      The following prayer has been made in the appeal execution:-
“In view of the above facts and circumstances this Hon’ble Commission may kindly be pleased to stay the operation, effect and implementation of the orders dated 11.04.2018 and 28.05.2018 during the pendency of the appellants’ proceedings already instituted, namely FA/920/2018 and AE 79/2018 and in the unlikeliest event of this Hon’ble Commission not finding favour with the aforesaid proceedings, put the appellants in the same position in which they would have been if the primary faulty order i.e. order dated 11.04.2018 itself had not been passed by the led. State Commission.”
","4.      It is seen from the record of this Commission that FA 920 of 2018 was dismissed on 03.12.2018 along with cost.  Similarly, AE 79 of 2018 was withdrawn by the appellant and the withdrawal was allowed vide order dated 03.12.2018 of this Commission.  The request in the present Execution Appeal Execution is only to stay the order dated 28.05.2018 (as order dated 11.04.2018 is an order giving date in the matter) till the pendency of FA No.920 of 2018 and AE No.79 of 2018.  As FA No.920 of 2018 and AE 79 of 2018 have already been disposed of, there is no justification for keeping this Appeal Execution pending.
5.      Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 stated that the appellants have already complied with the main order dated 16.09.2016 of the State Commission and the respondent No.1 has received the payment.  May be due to this reason, the appellant is not pursuing this appeal execution.
6.       Based on the above reasons, I do not find any merit in the Appeal Execution, however, in the background of the fact that the appellant has complied with the order dated 16.09.2016 as confirmed by the learned counsel for the complainant, I deem it appropriate to modify the order dated 28.05.2018 of the State Commission to the effect that order in respect of 2 years imprisonment is set aside and rest of the order dated 28.05.2018 is maintained. Appeal Execution No.91 of 2018 stands disposed of accordingly.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Shashank Singh, Advocate					Mr. Arjun M., Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner namely Puneet Yadu Dalmia against the order dated 24.07.2019 passed by the State Commission in F.A. No. 452/2018.
2.       The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner / complainant booked seven air tickets of first class with the respondent / opposite party – British Airways from Delhi – London, London – Zurich, Rome – London and London – Delhi.
3.       It has been alleged by the complainant that flight from Rome to London was delayed for more than three hours thus complainant’s ticket holders were adjusted in some other flight so that connecting flight from London to Delhi was not missed.The complainant alongwith all the six passengers were adjusted in some other flight, however in the business class and not in the first class.It has been alleged in the complaint that no proper lodging facility was provided by the opposite party airline and vegetarian meals were also not supplied by the airline whereas the vegetarian meals were requested by the passengers.The complaint was filed before the District Forum and the complaint was resisted by the opposite party by filing the written statement, however, the District Forum dismissed the complaint vide order dated 09.02.2018.
4.     The complainant then preferred an appeal being F.A. No.452/2018. However, the State Commission also dismissed the appeal and upheld the order of the District Forum vide its order dated 24.07.2019.Hence, the present revision petition.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at admission stage and perused the material on record.
6.     Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that when the first class tickets were booked for all seven passengers by paying so much higher amount of fares, passengers were entitled to some basic facility like airline lounge facility as well as meals that they had requested.It was argued by the learned counsel that the opposite party airline did not provide the lounge facility and even the vegetarian meals were not provided to all seven passengers as all the seven passengers had booked vegetarian meals.It was argued by the learned counsel that airline has admitted its fault in their e-mail dated 24.08.2015. The learned counsel relied upon the following paragraph of the e-mail dated 24.08.2015, which is as under:-
“When you tell us which special meal you need, we add a request to your booking.  As long as we know at least 24 hours before your flight, there should not be a problem at all, however, something clearly went wrong this time.  It’s very unusual for a special meal not to be loaded on board, but if it does not happen, our crew report it to our Catering Manager straight away so they can look into it.  I have also sent a report to our catering team to make them aware of how this affected your journey.”
7.     On the basis of above paragraph, the learned counsel argued that airline had admitted the mistake in not supplying the proper meals to these seven passengers due to delay in airline.Learned counsel stated that parents of the complainant could not take proper medicines in time and children also suffered as they could not get their meals at the proper time.Both the Fora below have not considered these problems faced by the complainant and his family members.Apart from this the learned counsel also emphasized that lounge facility was not provided at the airport, therefore, all the seven passengers had to face lot of problem at the airport itself.Thus, deficiency on the part of the airline is clearly proved, however, both the Fora below have given clean chit to the airline and complaint as well as appeal have been dismissed by the Fora below.
8.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and examined the record.
9.     It is seen from the order of the District forum that District Forum has recorded the following in respect of the meals:-
“7.     The complainant has alleged that Asian Vegetarian food was not provided in the Aircraft to him but from the circumstances of the case, it emerges that only one Asian Food was booked and as such the food was provided as per the request made by the complainant and members of his family.  The allegation that the complainant and members of his family remained hungry cannot be said to have substantiated.”
10.    From the above, it is brought out that only one Asian food was booked and this food was provided as per request of the complainant.In this regard, the complainant has relied upon the e-mail dated 24.08.2015, wherein airline has stated that something clearly went wrong this time.
11.    Though, complaint has taken this as an admission on the part of the airline, however, it can mean both the things that something went wrong from the side of the complainant or something went wrong from the side of the airline.In the context of the findings given by the District Forum as mentioned above, the chances may be that airline is referring to the mistake by the complainant.
12.     So far lounge facility is concerned, the airport of Rome and London are big airports and chances are there that air lounges will be there and any person having a relevant ticket can avail services of these lounges of the specific airline.
13.     The important legal aspect in the present case is that complainant is disputing the findings of the facts given by the Fora below.The fact is that both the Fora below have given concurrent findings of facts in respect of the services provided by the airline and in respect of the deficiencies alleged by the complainant.Against the concurrent findings of facts, the scope under the revision petition is quite limited and facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs. United India Insurance Company, 2011 (3) Scale 654 as follows:-
“Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view that what was taken by the two Forums. The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous)  interpretation of the same set of facts. This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked. In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act has been transgressed. It was not a case where such a view could have been taken, by setting aside the concurrent finding of two fora.”
14.    The District Forum in its order has given liberty to the complainant to seek refund of difference in the fare of first class and the business class from booking agent.The learned counsel for the petitioner / complainant has not argued anything about the refund of the difference of the fares.It seems that problem of refund is not persisting.
","15.    On the basis of the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 24.07.2019 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.Accordingly, R.P. No. 2154 of 2019 is dismissed at the admission stage.

The present revision petition has been filed against the judgment dated 05.07.2017 of the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (‘the State Commission’) in First Appeal no. A/892 of 2015 whereby the appeal filed by the petitioner against the order dated 24th June 2015 passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Kolkata, Unit II (‘the District Forum) in C C no. 36 of 2015 has been dismissed in default.
2.     This matter was listed before this Bench on 23rd September 2019. The proxy Counsel Mr Zeeshan Ali stated that the main Counsel Mr Asish Dutta was not available to argue the matter. However, the learned counsel for the respondent stated that the District Forum has passed the order of refund of Rs.10,50,000/- along with interest @ 10% per annum within one month of the order of the District Forum. This order was passed after contest by the opposite parties/ petitioners. The petitioners are only delaying the matter as firstly, they absented themselves before the State Commission even though the appeal was preferred by the petitioners themselves and secondly even in this Commission also, the learned counsel was not available to argue the matter. The adjournment was opposed by the learned counsel for the respondent. Learned counsel for the respondent further stated that in the revision petition including the grounds, there is no mention of any reason for the absence of the counsel or the party before the State Commission when the impugned order was passed. The State Commission’s order further refers that the petitioner was absent on earlier occasion also. This clearly means that the petitioner is only trying to delay the implementation of the order of the District Forum by keeping the litigation going in one way or the other.  The petitioner has not given any reason for the absence of the counsel or the petitioner before the State Commission.
3.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent and have gone through the material on record. The impugned order of the State Commission dated 05.07.2017 reads as under:
“None appears for the appellants. It appears that the appellants remained absent on the earlier occasion. Ld Advocate for the respondent is present. Under the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal for default in appearance of the appellants. Interim order of stay already passed stands vacated”.
","4.     From the above order, one thing is very clear that apart from being absent on 05.07.2017 the petitioner and /or his counsel were absent even on earlier occasion also. In the revision petition no grounds have been given for the absence of the learned counsel or the petitioner before the State Commission on 05.07.2017 or on the earlier occasion. The State Commission has not passed any order on the merits of the case, however, the petitioner has only mentioned certain grounds which appear related to the merit of the case. As the petitioner is not available to justify the absence of his counsel before the State Commission on 05.07.2017 and nothing has been mentioned in the revision petition in this regard, it is difficult for this Commission to remand the matter to the State Commission, as the matter has already been decided by the District Forum on contest, and the appeal has been dismissed in default and no pleadings have been made in the revision petition about the reasons for the absence of the learned counsel or the petitioner before the State Commission.
5.     Based on the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, jurisdictional error or material irregularity in the order dated 05.07.2017 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission. Accordingly, revision petition no. 2746 of 2017 is dismissed.

","These two revision petitions have been filed by two different petitioners/complainants against the order of the State Commission dated 27.05.2015 passed in first appeal Nos.1506 of 2014 &1507 of 2014.
RP NO.2693 OF 2015
2.      Brief facts of the case are that Complainant purchased a flat in OP’s project under Time Linked plan for basic price of Rs.33,36,770/- and after payment of booking amount Flat no. F-402 was allotted vide allotment letter cum agreement (along with terms & conditions) dated 27.11.2006. Complainant paid a total sum of Rs.33,41,946/- alongwith service tax towards cost of the flat wherein OP charged Rs.1,19,363/- as interest @18% for delayed payment.  OP handover the possession on 22.9.2013 (scheduled date was on or before 31.10.2008) with certain discrepancies, after charging a sum of Rs.1,72,683/- which as per payment schedule was to be paid at the time of taking possession of the flat but the same was paid by complainant on 13.12.2012 as demanded by OP. As per agreement clause, in case of delay the allottee  was to get a compensation  of  Rs. 5 per sq. ft. of the super area upto 22.9.2013 but OP gave only for the period 1.2.2009 to 30.9.2012. The complainant prays to (refund interest amount of Rs.1,19,363/- charged on delay payment + Compensation of Rs 5 per sq. ft. for the delay upto 22.9.2013 + amount deposited by complainant upto 31.10.2008) along with 18% interest; to pay interest @ 18% on Rs.1,72,683/- for the period for wrongly charged i.e. 13.12.2012 was actually to be paid on 22.9.2013, 2 lakh as compensation and Rs.33,000/- towards cost. The complaint has been resisted by the OPs by filing the written statement. OPs in its reply has stated that complainant herself has duly settled the accounts and authenticated the same by appending her signatures thereon & has chosen to proceed with the possession of the flat in question & have the same registered as per law without so much as having refused possession of the same or registering her protest.  District Forum dismissed the complaint on complainant not being a consumer since the contract had been concluded. Complainant had accepted the final statement of accounts & has chosen to proceed with the possession therefore the contract had been concluded thereon. State Commission dismissed the appeal of complainant holding the complainant as not a consumer of OPs after delivery of the possession of the allotted property & settlement of the final account by her. Hence, after a delay of 9 days revision petition has been filed by the complainant on the ground that OP  intentionally delayed the possession of the flat for approx. 5yrs even without any reasonable statement falls in the category of unfair trade practice & being in dominant position influenced the final statement agreement by making their own terms & condition.
RP NO.2694 OF 2015
3.      Brief facts of the case are that Complainant purchase a flat in OP’s project under Down payment plan for basic price of Rs.26,23,656/- and after payment of booking amount Flat no. 0-504 was allotted vide allotment letter cum agreement (along with terms and conditions) dated 27.06.2007. Complainant paid a total sum of Rs.22,82,581/- upto 31.10.2008 towards cost of the flat wherein OP wrongly charged Rs.10,674/- as interest @18% for delayed payment. OP handover the possession on 31.7.2013 (scheduled date was on or before 31.10.2008) with certain discrepancies, after charging a sum of Rs.1,35,237/- which as per payment schedule was to be paid at the time of taking possession of the flat but the same was paid by complainant on 12.12.2012 as demanded by OP. As per agreement clause, in case of delay the allottee was to get a compensation of Rs. 5 per sq. ft. of the super area upto 31.7.2013 but OP gave only for the period 1.11.2008 to 30.9.2012. The complainant prays to (refund interest amount of Rs.10,674/- charged on delay payment + Compensation of Rs.5 per sq. ft. for the delay upto 31.7.2013 + amount deposited by complainant upto 31.10.2008) along with 18% interest; to pay interest @ 18% on 1,35,237 for the period for wrongly charged i.e. 12.12.2012 was actually to be paid on 31.7.2013, 2 lakh as compensation and Rs.33,000/- towards cost. The complaint has been resisted by the OPs by filing the written statement. OPs in its reply has stated that complainant himself has duly settled the accounts and authenticated the same by appending his signatures thereon and has chosen to proceed with the possession of the flat in question and have the same registered as per law without so much as having refused possession of the same or registering his protest. District Forum dismissed the complaint on complainant not being a consumer since the contract had been concluded. Complainant had accepted the final statement of accounts and has chosen to proceed with the possession therefore the contract had been concluded thereon. State Commission dismissed the appeal of complainant holding the complainant as not a consumer of OPs after delivery of the possession of the allotted property & settlement of the final account by him. Hence, after a delay of 9 days revision petition has been filed by the complainant on the ground that OP  intentionally delayed the possession of the flat for approx. 5yrs even without any reasonable statement falls in the category of unfair trade practice and being in dominant position influenced the final statement agreement by making their own terms and condition.
4.      As the brief facts of the two cases are similar, these revision petitions are being decided together.  RP No.2693 of 2015 will be considered for examination.
","5.      Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused record.  Learned counsel for the petitioners stated that there was a delay of about 5 years in handing over the possession to the complainants and therefore, the complainants are entitled to get compensation in the form of interest on the deposited amount for the period beyond the due date of possession as per the agreement.  It is a well known fact that builder-buyer agreements are unilateral and in favour of the builder.  The compensation of Rs.5/- per square ft. per month is not sufficient to compensate for the delay in handing over the possession.  Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Commission in number of their orders have allowed interest to be paid on the amount paid by the complainant for the period of delay.  District Forum has wrongly given a finding that the complainant is not a consumer as the contract between the parties has already finally concluded.  The State Commission has also dismissed the appeal of the complainant on the ground that the complainant is not a consumer after delivery has been given to the complainant and the complainant has finally accepted the statement of account wherein the compensation @ Rs.5/- per square ft. per month has been adjusted.  Learned counsel stated that the account was to be settled to get the possession otherwise the possession would have been delayed further.  Clearly builder being a dominant party in the contract, the complainant had to succumb to his dictates.  Clearly the complainant is a consumer and is entitled to get interest on the deposited amount from the date of due possession till actual date of possession.
6.      On the other hand, the leaned counsel for the respondents/opposite parties stated that the complainant has taken the possession without any protest and has also settled the account by putting her signature. Once possession has been delivered and the accounts have been settled contract between the parties comes to an end.  Therefore, both the fora below have rightly concluded that the complainant is not a consumer.  The respondent has already paid compensation for delay in possession as per the agreed provision in the agreement.  Thus, there is no merit in the revision petition and the same should be dismissed.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record.  First of all, it is seen that there is a delay of 9 days in filing both the revision petitions.  As delay is nominal, the same is condoned on the grounds mentioned in the application for condonation of delay.
8.      Coming to the merits of the case, it is seen that the fora below have not found the complainants as consumers but the fact is that they may not be entitled for any interest on the deposited amount as they have already taken the possession and the contract has been completed, however, if one party is not satisfied with the completion of the agreement, it can always file a complaint within a period of two years from the date of cause of action.  The complainants are not satisfied with the accounts that have been finalized by the opposite party.  The complaints have been filed within 2 years of the date of finalization of the accounts.  Thus, the complainants would be deemed to be consumer in the facts and circumstances of these cases.  As the contracts have already been completed, the complainants can only raise the question of deficiency in completion of the contract.  The complainants are entitled to be compensated as per the clauses of the agreement signed between the parties.
9.      It is observed that in revision petition No.2693 of 2015, the possession has been handed over on 22nd September, 2013, however, the penalty for delay in possession has been given only up to 30th September 2012 as is evident from the settled accounts.  Similarly, in revision petition No.2694 of 2015, the possession has been handed over on 31st July, 2013 whereas the penalty for delay in possession at the rate Rs.5/- per square ft. per month has been paid only upto 30th September, 2012.  Though the fora below have taken a correct decision that the complainants are not entitled to further compensation in the form of interest on the deposited amount as the agreements have finally been concluded but from the above it is clear that the opposite party has not paid the full compensation even as per the agreement.  Therefore, the complainants are definitely entitled to compensation of Rs.5/- per square ft. per month for a period of about 11 months and 20 days in the revision petition no.2693 of 2015 and for a period of nine months and 10 days in the matter of revision petition No.2694 of 2015.
10.    Based on the above discussion, the revision petitions are partly allowed and the respondent, opposite party is directed to pay penalty for delayed possession at the rate Rs.5/- per square ft. per month to the complainants for a period of 11 months 20 days in revision petition No.2693 of 2015 and for a period of 9 months 10 days in the revision petition No.2694 of 2015.  The respondent opposite party shall also pay Rs.10,000/- (ten thousands only) as cost of litigation to the respective complainant in each case.

JUDGEMENT
JUSTICE V. K. JAIN (ORAL)
1.        The Complainant/Respondent is present in person. He submits that he wants to argue his case himself. Accordingly, I have heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellants and have also heard the Complainant/Respondent.
2.        M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment, Appellant in FA No.310 of 2016, owned some land in Jagatpura, Jaipur and it entered into an Agreement with M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers for construction of residential apartments on the said land. The construction was to be carried out solely by M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers. The residential flats, to be constructed by the said builder, were to be shared between the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment and the Builder, namely, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers. 80% of the apartments could be sold by the Builder whereas 20% of the apartments were to come to the share of the Land Owner.
3.        The Complainant booked a residential apartment with M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers and Flat No.D-603 in the proposed project was allotted to him for a total consideration of more than Rs.22,00,000/-. An Agreement to Sale was then executed on 17-01-2007 between the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartments, the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers Ltd. and the Complainant, Mr. Pushpender Singh Sekhawat. In terms of the Agreement, the possession was to be delivered to the Complainant within 24 months of the commercial launch of the project.
4.        The Complainant also executed a Tripartite Agreement with M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers and Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (HDFC Ltd.), Appellant in FA No.370 of 2015. Under the said Agreement, a loan of Rs.20,50,000/- was sanctioned by HDFC Ltd. to the Complainant. Clause 12 of the Agreement executed between the parties required the Builder to pay the Pre EMI Interest till possession on the loan disbursed by HDFC Ltd. to the Complainant. The said Clause reads as under:
""That the party of the second part called the Builder has agreed as a discount, to pay the Pre EMI Interest payable every month till possession, on the loan disbursed by the lender to the Borrower. The primary responsibility to pay the Pre EMI to HDFC shall, however, remain that of the Borrower and that he/she shall not be absolved of this responsibility and duty in any case whatsoever.""
5.        The construction of the flats did not commence, though part of the sanctioned loan was disbursed by HDFC Ltd. directly to the Builder. Since the construction of the flats was not forthcoming, the Complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a Consumer Complaint impleading the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment, the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers and the Financer, HDFC Ltd., as the Opposite Parties in the Complaint.
6.        The Complaint was resisted only by HDFC Ltd.. Neither the Land Owner nor the Developer came forward to contest the Complaint.
7.        The State Commission, vide impugned Order dated 03-02-2015 directed as under:
""1.       That they should not recover any amount from the complainant prior to the delivery of possession of the allotted flat to the complainant.
2.         Amount of loan be recovered from the Opposite Parties No.1 & 2 who are the Original Debtor and the installments be received from the complainant in regular installments after delivery of possession of flat. The Opposite Party No.3 is not entitled to recover interest whatsoever before handing over the possession.
3.         The Opposite Parties No.1 & 2 will pay Rs.2,50,000/-, deposited by the Complainant, from the date of deposit till its actual payment alongwith interest @ 12% or possession of the flat be delivered within three months.
4.         With negligent acts of the Opposite Bank, the name of the complainant has been put in the CIBIL, hence, the Opposite Party No.1 is directed that action be taken for removal of the name of the complainant from CIBIL.
5.         The Opposite Party No.1 and 2 will pay separately Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs Only) for mental harassment and litigation cost of the complaint Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five  Thousands only) and the Opposite Party No.3 will pay Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lac only) for mental harassment and litigation cost of the complaint Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five  Thousands only) to the complainant within 30 days, if not paid within 30 days, interest @ 12% per annum on the above whole amount will be payable.""
8.        Being aggrieved from the Order passed by the State Commission, the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment has approached this Commission by way of First Appeal No.310 of 2016 whereas HDFC Ltd. has approached this Commission by way of First Appeal No.370 of 2015.
9.        The first question which arises for consideration is as to whether the Complainant is entitled to any relief against the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment. It is evident from a bare perusal of the Agreement to Sale executed between the Complainant, Land owner and the Builder that the entire obligation to construct the flats was upon the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers. The construction was not to be carried out by the Land Owner, M/s. Krishna Villa Apartment. Therefore, if there has been a default on account of the flat having not been constructed, the said default is solely on the part of the Builder without the Land Owner being, in any manner, responsible for the said default. Admittedly, the flat was booked by the Complainant directly with the Builder and the payment was also made by him only to the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers. The Land Owner was a party to the Sale Agreement, only because the land underneath the proposed construction was owned by it. Therefore, the State Commission, in my opinion, was not justified in directing the Land Owner to either deliver possession of the Apartment or refund the amount received from the Complainant. The direction for payment of compensation by the Land Owner was also not justified, there being no default on its part.
10.      As far as HDFC Ltd. is concerned, though as per Clause 12 of the Tripartite Agreement, despite the Builder having undertaken to pay the Pre EMI Interest till possession, the primary obligation to pay even Pre EMI to HDFC Ltd. was of the borrower, the Learned Counsel for the HDFC Ltd. states, on instructions, that they will recover the entire loan disbursed by them to the Complainant as well as interest payable on the said loan only from the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers. He further submits that the grievance of the HDFC Ltd. in these Appeals is limited to the compensation awarded by the State Commission against them. In view of the said statement, I need not go into the question as to whether the Complainant is required to repay the loan which has been disbursed to him by HDFC Ltd. and/or interest on that loan. However, I am in agreement with the Learned Counsel for HDFC Ltd. that in the facts and circumstances of the case, there was no justification for awarding any compensation against HDFC Ltd., there being no defect or deficiency in the services rendered by it to the Complainant.
","11.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the Appeals are disposed of with the following directions:
the entire loan disbursed by HDFC Ltd. to the Complainant as well as interest payable on that loan shall be recovered only from the Builder, M/s. Gold Dream Builders & Developers;

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. G.N. Reddy, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mrs. K. Radha, Advocate 
","This appeal has been filed by the Chairman-cum-Managing Director Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited and Others challenging the order dated 11th  September 2012 passed by the Andhra Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Hyderabad (in short “the State Commission”) in consumer complaint No. 20 of 2011.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that Sri T.Gopala Krishna, husband of the complainant No.1, father of the complainant Nos.2 & 3 and son of the complainant Nos.4 & 5 was an agriculturist and was having electricity service connection to his bore well with 5 HP connection vide service No.29656001287.  On 02.06.2010, the said T. Gopala Krishna while operating the bore well in his agricultural field came into contact with a 11 KV main electrical wire which caught fire and fell down on him as a result of which he died on the spot.  An FIR was registered with the police on the same day.  The post mortem was conducted in the Government General Hospital and the cause of death was established as electrocution.  According to the complainants, the deceased was 44 years old and was earning Rs.2,00,000/- p.a. by leasing his bullock cart, mulching cow, sheep rearing and from agricultural operations.  Complainants alleged that it was the duty of the appellants to maintain the electric poles properly and they never rectified them even though the wire was in a sagging condition.  Therefore, it is only due to the negligence of the appellant that the said T.Gopala Krishna died. Complainant, being aggrieved, filed the complaint claiming compensation of Rs.22,00,000/- along with interest and cost of Rs.10,000/-
3.      The complaint was contested mainly on the ground that the incident happened due to quarreling of large number of crows and “Y” phase conductor of 11 KV wire was accidentally cut due to short circuit of conductors as an impact of large number of crows.  The wire was hanging at a height of 4 feet from the ground with a support of 11 KV fuse set provided to DTR.  Deceased should have avoided contact with the wire.  The wires were regularly maintained by the appellants.
4.      The State Commission has passed the following order on 11.09.2012:-
“In the result this complaint is allowed in part directing opposite parties to pay Rs.14,00,000/- to the complainants in the following manner.
Rs.5,25,000/- to the first complainant being the wife.
Rs.2,62,500/- each to the second and third complainants who are the minors and these amounts shall be kept in a fixed deposit under the custody of the mother till the minors attain majority.
Rs.1,75,000/- each to the parents who are the fourth and fifth complainants herein’.
The amount of Rs.50,000/- awarded would be equally shared among all the five complainants together with costs of Rs.5,000/- to be paid within four weeks from the date of receipt of this order.”
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused record. The learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission had misconstrued a stray case in applying the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 so as to invoke the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum for a fatal accident which is covered by the Fatal Accidents Act and which is a tort which has to be decided in Civil Court and for which the Consumer Forum is not having jurisdiction.
6.      In support of his arguments learned counsel for the appellants referred to the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Chairman, Grid Corporation of Orissa Ltd. (GRIDCO) and Ors. Vs. Sukamani Das (smt.) and others. (1999) 7 SCC 298 wherein it has been observed:-
“6.  In our opinion, the High Court committed an error in entertaining the writ petitions even though they were not fit cases for exercising power under Article 226 of the Constitution.  The High Court went wrong in proceeding on the basis that as the deaths had taken place because of electrocution as a result of the deceased coming into contact with snapped live wires of the electric transmission lines of the appellants, that “admittedly prima facie amounted to negligence on the part of the appellants”.  The High Court failed to appreciate that all these cases were actions in tort and negligence was required to be established firstly by the claimants. The mere fact that the wire of the electric transmission line belonging to Appellant I had snapped and the deceased had come in contact with it and had died was not be itself sufficient for awarding compensation.  It also required to be examined whether the wire had snapped as a result of any negligence of the appellants and under which circumstances the deceased had come in contact with the wire. In view of the specific defences raised by the appellants in each of these cases they deserved an opportunity to prove that proper care and precautions were taken in maintaining the transmission lines and yet the wires had snapped because of circumstances beyond their control or unauthorised intervention of third parties or that the deceased had not died in the manner stated by the petitioners.  These questions could not have been decided properly on the basis of affidavits only. It is the settled legal position that where disputed questions of facts are involved a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is not a proper remedy.  The High Court has not and could not have held that the disputes in these cases were raised for the sake of raising them and that there was no substance therein.  The High Court should have directed the writ petitioners to approach the civil court as it was done in OJC No.5229 of 1996.”
7.      The learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission was not justified in awarding a huge compensation without there being any negligence on the part of the appellants (opp. Parties) since on the date of accident, the incident happened due to quarreling of large number of crows and the “Y” Phase conductor of 11 K.V. line was accidentally cut due to short circuit of conductors which was due to impact of large crowd of crows and the snapped wire was hanging at the height of 4 feet from the ground.
8.      Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission was not justified in awarding the compensation to the respondents against the appellants without there being any documentary evidence with regard to the extent of land taken on lease by the deceased to arrive at the alleged income of deceased from the said lands.
9.      Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission has wrongly computed the compensation on the imaginary figure of income of the deceased as stated by the complainants when it is an admitted fact from the documents filed with the complaint that the income of the deceased/complainants from all the sources was Rs.18,000/- which was issued by the competent authority.
10.    Leaned counsel for the appellants further stated that the State Commission has wrongly computed the compensation taking the age of deceased as 44 years on the date of death when from the documents filed by the complainants along with the complaint i.e. the FIR and complaint given to the concerned S.H.O.P.S. shows that age of the deceased at the time of accident was 46 years and the same fact was confirmed by the inquest report filed by the complainants.
11.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent complainants stated that the State Commission has already considered all the objections raised in the appeal and has allowed the complaint on merits. The compensation has been awarded on the basis of the formula for compensation in the motor accident claims cases. Thus, there is no error in the calculation of the compensation. The State Commission has decided the annual income of the deceased on the basis of the evidence produced by the complainants and the opposite party has not produced any evidence contradicting the assertions of the complainants. Accordingly, there is no error in the calculation of income of the deceased by the State Commission.
12.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. It is seen that there is a delay of 40 days in filing the present appeal, however, this delay has already been condoned by this Commission vide order dated 10th January 2013.
13.    The main legal objection raised by the appellants is that the consumer forum is not competent to look into this type of disputes as the same is a sort of tort which can only be decided by a civil court. The learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Chairman, Grid Corporation of Orissa Ltd. (GRIDCO) and Ors. Vs. Sukamani Das (smt.) and others (supra) which is a case of 1998. This Commission decided OP No.253 of 2002, Smt. Munesh Devi Vs. U.P.Power Corporation Ltd. & ors, decided on 03.02.2014 as a consumer dispute and the Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld the decision of this Commission in the SLP, Civil Appeal No.5672 of 2014, decided on 22.08.2014. This shows that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has now accepted such cases within the ambit of consumer disputes. The question of such complainants being consumer or not within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, has been examined in detail by this Commission in Managing Director cum Chairman T.S. Transco & Ors. Vs. Mohd. Noorullha Shareef & Ors. FA No.235 of 2010 & FA 352 of 2010, decided on 07.03.2018 (NC) and it has been found that such complainants would be deemed to be consumers. This Commission in this judgment has observed as under:-
","“9.       The State Commission has given its award on the basis of  judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in M.P. Electricity Board Vs. Shail Kumar, 2002 (2) ALD 4(SC), wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has allowed the compensation on the basis of strict liability. However, that was not a case under consumer Protection Act.  This Commission in OP No.253 of 2002, titled Smt. Munesh Devi Vs. U.P. Power Corporation Ltd., & Ors., decided on 03.02.2014,  has allowed the complaint which was a similar matter where the death of the husband of the complainant was caused due to the transformer installed and maintained by the opposite parties, while he was returning home from duty.  He was taken to the Hospital, where he succumbed to burn injuries.  This Commission awarded compensation of Rs.25.00 lakhs along with interest.  Aggrieved by that order SLP was filed by the opposite parties.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal no.5672 of 2014 dismissed the SLP vide its order dated 22.08.2014.  This was a peculiar case where the complainant had earlier filed civil case against the opposite parties for damages and compensation, however, the same could not be pursued as the complainant could not pay the court fees and her request to exempt from the payment of court fees was rejected by the High Court and by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  In that situation, the complainant filed complaint case before this Commission under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the same was allowed by this Commission and SLP filed against that order was dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  These facts clearly show that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has accepted jurisdiction of the consumer fora to decide such cases.  Against this, no confirmation by the Hon’ble Supreme court in the cases decided by this Commission as referred to by the learned counsel for the OP/A.P. Transco (now T.S. Transco) has been brought to my notice.  Thus, after confirmation of the jurisdiction of consumer fora by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, I do not see any doubt in exercise of jurisdiction by the consumer fora to decide such complaints.  Indirectly, this implies that the complainants meet the criteria for being a consumer in such cases.  Moreover, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board (supra) has established the principle that the OP will be liable from the strict liability point of view to compensate the complainant.”
14.    Moreover, Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 provides for an alternate remedy and therefore a complainant can file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 instead of taking action under the Fatal Accidents Act if the complainant can come under the category of consumer under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986.
15.    Now coming to the objection raised by the appellants in respect of the calculation of income of the deceased, it is seen that the State Commission has observed the following:-
“For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the considered view that there is deficiency in service on behalf of the opposite parties in not maintaining the electric wires thereby leading to the death of T.Gopala Krishna who was having agricultural fields to an extent of Ac.1.14 and had also taken on lease lands totaling to Ac.10.21 as evidenced under Exs.A14 A15 and A16.  The opposite parties did not take any steps to examine K. Polli Reddy, P. Harshavardhan Reddy and V.Gopalaiah who filed third party affidavit stating that the deceased cultivated Ac.10.21 and also got income from other sources by leasing out his bullock cart, mulching cow, sheep rearing etc. to an extent of Rs.1,50,000/- p.a. Ex.A1, FIR evidences that the age of the deceased is 44 years and when we apply the multiplier of 14, the amount is Rs.150,000/- less 1/3rd =Rs.1,00,000/- x 14 = Rs.14,00,000/-.  We also award Rs.50,000/- towards loss of love and affection and loss of estate as we are not inclined to award interest together with costs of Rs.5,000/-.”
16.    From the above, it is clear that the State Commission has relied upon the documentary as well as oral evidence by third parties in assessing the income of the deceased. The opposite parties have not examined the third parties who have given their evidence in favor of the complainants. Onus was on the opposite parties to have rebutted the evidence given by the third parties either by way of documentary evidence or by way of oral evidence of some other parties. Thus, there is no ground to interfere with the finding of the State Commission in respect of the income arrived at for calculating the compensation. Another objection has been raised in respect of the age of the deceased. The State Commission has taken the age of the deceased to be 44 years whereas, the contention of the appellants is that as par the documents submitted by the complainants themselves like the FIR and the complaint given to the SHO as well as the inquest report, the age of the deceased was 46 years at the time of accident. Thus, the compensation should have been calculated on the basis of this age. It is seen from the record that the appellants have not filed certified copies of the documents on which they wanted to rely for the proof of age of the deceased. Thus, the assertion of the opposite parties cannot be accepted without any proof. The complainants have stated in the complaint the age of the deceased at the time of accident to be 44 years and the State Commission has also relied on some other evidence to take the age of the deceased as 44 years.  State Commission has also mentioned FIR as a document on which the age of 44 years has been ascertained. In these circumstances, I do not see any reason to find fault with the finding of the State Commission particularly in the absence of any proof filed by the appellants before this Commission. Hence, I do not find any merit in the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the age of the deceased should have been considered to be 46 years.
17.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any merit in the present appeal and accordingly the FA No. 714 of 2012 is dismissed. 50% of the awarded amount by the State Commission was deposited by the appellants with this Commission as mentioned in the order dated 10th January 2013 and 4th July 2013. This amount be released to the complainants by the Registry of this Commission within a period of 30 days from the date of this order and the remaining amount should be paid by the appellants within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

  For the Appellant     :Ms. Vandana Sehgal, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","C.VISWANATH
1.       The present Appeal is filed by the Appellants under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No. 14/10 dated 10.01.2019.
2.       Alongwith the appeal, IA/19305/2019, an application for condonation of delay has been filed by the appellants. The appellants have not mentioned the number of days to be condoned. There is a delay of 284 days according to the Registry.
3.       We have heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellants and also carefully perused the record.
4.       The learned counsel for the appellants argued that they have not received copy of the impugned order. They got information of the impugned order only on 06.04.2019, when they received letter dated 06.04.2019 from the respondent. Thereafter, the appellants took time in seeking legal advice on filing the appeal. Further the appellants searched for an advocate to file an appeal in the National Commission, which took some more time. After appointment of an advocate, the appellants sent necessary documents from Mumbai to Delhi for preparation of the appeal, which was returned to the appellants for signatures and verification etc. It was submitted that delay in filing the appeal was neither intentional nor deliberate. Learned counsel for the appellants further submitted that a Co-ordinate Bench of this Commission, in a similar case, in FA/2185/2019 on 21.11.2019 (Ravi Developments vs. Mr. Vijay Kumar Bajaj & Anr.) issued notice to the respondents.
5.       The learned counsel argued that they did not receive copy of the impugned order passed by the State Commission. It is important to note that the impugned order was passed in the presence of the counsel for the appellants. They cannot be permitted to take the plea that they had no knowledge of the order passed by the State Commission. As per record, free certified copy of the impugned order was issued by the State Commission on 01.02.2019. There is no reason why the appellants would not have got it. There is only a bald averment on behalf of the appellants that they had not received the copy of the impugned order. Appellant No.1 is a partnership firm and it is a common knowledge that firms/companies maintain a despatch register for every communication sent/received. The appellants have not produced any documentary evidence to substantiate their plea that they had not received copy of the impugned order. The appellants by their own admission state that they took time to search for an advocate and thereafter in seeking legal advice. This shows that they were themselves responsible for the delay. The appellants are required to explain each and every day’s delay. They have not mentioned when they sought legal advice; date on which they decided to file the appeal; when the advocate prepared the file and sent it to their Mumbai office and on which date the appellants sent back the appeal to the advocate for filing the same in the National Commission. They have not even mentioned the number of days of delay to be condoned. So far as the submission of learned counsel for the appellants that Co-ordinate Bench of this Commission in Ravi Developments vs. Mr. Vijay Kumar Bajaj & Anr (supra) has issued notice to the respondents, it is necessary to mention that the delay in filing the appeals are not the same. In the above case, appellants filed the appeal (IA/17941/2019) with only a delay of 46 days as per their application for condonation of delay whereas in the present case there is a delay of 284 days which has not been properly addressed and explained. Moreover, mere issuance of notice cannot be treated as condonation of delay.
Hon’ble Apex Court held that settled legal proposition of law of limitation has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes, though it may harshly affect a particular party.  The Appellant has not been able to give adequate and sufficient reason which prevented them to approach this Commission within the limitation.
6.       Hon’ble Supreme Court has also held that party who has not acted diligently or remain inactive is not entitled for condonation of delay. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “R. B. Ramlingam vs. R. B. Bhavaneshwari, I (2009) CLT 188 (SC)” has also described the test for determining whether the petitioner has acted with due diligence or not.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
""We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
7.       Condonation of delay is not a matter of right and the applicant has to set out the case showing sufficient reasons which prevented them to come to the Court/Commission within the stipulated period of limitation.   The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the matter of Ram Lal and Ors. Vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361 has held as  under:
","“It is, however, necessary to emphasise that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a condition precedent for the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by Section 5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condoning delay has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
8.       The burden is on the applicant to show that there was sufficient cause for the delay.  The expression ‘sufficient cause’ has been discussed and defined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Basawaraj&Anr. Vs. The Spl. Land Acquisition Officer, 2013 AIR SCW 6510, as under:
“Sufficient cause is the cause for which defendant could not be blamed for his absence.  The meaning of the word “sufficient” is “adequate” or “enough”, inasmuch as may be necessary to answer the purpose intended. Therefore, the word “sufficient” embraces no more than that which provides a platitude, which when the act done suffices to accomplish the purpose intended in the facts and circumstances existing in a case, duly examined from the view point of a reasonable standard of a cautious man.  In this context, “sufficient cause” means that the party should not have acted in a negligent manner or there was a want of bonafide on its part in view of the facts and circumstances of a case or it cannot be alleged that the party has “not acted diligently” or “remained inactive”.  However, the facts and circumstances of each case must afford sufficient ground to enable the Court concerned to exercise discretion for the reason that whenever he court exercises discretion, it has to be exercised judiciously. The applicant must satisfy the Court that he was prevented by any “sufficient cause” from prosecuting his case, and unless a satisfactory explanation is furnished, the Court should not allow the application for condonation of delay.  The court has to examine whether the mistake is bonafide or was merely a device to cover an ulterior purpose. (See: Manindra Land and Building Corporation Ltd.  V. Bhootnath Banerjee &Ors, AIR 1964 SC 1336; LalaMatadin V. A.Narayanan, AIR 1970 SC 1953; Parimal V. Veena alias Bharti AIR 2011 SC 1150 L2011 AIR SEW 1233); and ManibenDevraj Shah V. Municipal Corporation of Brihan Mumbai, AIR 2012 SC 1629: (2012 AIR SCW 2412).
……………
It is a settle legal proposition that law of limitation may harshly affect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes.  The Court has no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds.  “A result flowing from a statutory provision is never an evil.  A Court has no power to ignore that provision to relieve what it considers a distress resulting from its operation.”  The statutory provision may cause hardship or inconvenience to a particular party but the Court has no choice but to enforce it giving full effect to the same.  The legal maxim “dura lexsedlex” which means “the law is hard but it is the law”, stands attracted in such a situation.  It has consistently been held that, “inconvenience is not” a decisive factor to be considered while interpreting a statute.
………..
The law on the issue can be summarized to the effect that where a case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the applicant has to explain the court as to what was the “sufficient cause” which means an adequate and enough reason which prevented him to approach the court within limitation. In case a party is found to be negligent, or for want of bona fide on his part in the facts and circumstances of the case, or found to have not acted diligently or remained inactive, there cannot be a justified ground to condone the delay.  No court could be justified in condoning such an inordinate delay by imposing any condition whatsoever.  The application is to be decided only within the parameters laid down by this court in regard to the condonation of delay.  In case there was no sufficient cause to prevent a litigant to approach the court on time condoning the delay without any justification, putting any condition whatsoever, amounts to passing an order in violation of the statutory provisions and it tantamounts to showing utter disregard to the legislature”.
9.       Also in the case of “Anshul Aggarwal Vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (2011) 14 SCC 578, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has warned the Commissions to keep in mind while dealing with such applications the special nature of the Consumer Protection Act.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer foras.""
10.     In view of the above, we find no sufficient ground to condone the delay.  The application for condonation of delay is accordingly dismissed. As a consequence, Appeal is also dismissed in limine being barred by limitation.

Pronounced on:      6th  January  2020
The present revision petition has been filed against the order of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U.P (for short “State Commission”) whereby, the order of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Agra (for short “District Forum”) was modified .
2.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the revision petition are that in August, 1994, the U.P. Awas Evam Vikas Parishad OP had published in the ‘Amar Ujala’ newspaper about the auction sale of some houses. In the auction, the Complainant made his bid for House No. A- 265 for Rs. 2,33,000/-.  The Complainant had paid 10 % amount of the bid. It was assured that the allotment letter would be issued and possession of the LIG house would be given. The Complainant alleged that the OP did not allot the house nor gave possession inspite of various requests. Being aggrieved, the Complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the OP by way of the written statement.  It was asserted that the auction was conducted to sell the houses but the OP never assured to allot the houses. The Complainant’s participation was admitted but vide letter dated 16.05.1997, the Complainant’s bid was cancelled by the Parishad and the refund without interest was allowed. Hence, the complaint was liable to be dismissed.
4.      The District Forum, vide order dated 18.11.2000, directed the OP to give possession of House No. A- 265 , Phase No. 1, Agra to Complainant and  Rs. 5,000/-  as compensation for mental torture .
5.      Being aggrieved, the OP filed an appeal before the State Commission. The State Commission vide its order dated 08.01.2016 partly allowed the appeal and modified the order of the District Forum. The order to handover possession of the house was set- aside. Rest of the order of the District Forum remained same.
6.      Being dissatisfied by the order dated 08.01.2016 passed by the State Commission, the Complainant preferred the present Revision Petition.
7.      Heard the learned counsel for the Petitioner at admission stage, perused the record and gave thoughtful consideration to the arguments. Admittedly the complainant’s bid was cancelled.  The possession was given to another person after cancellation of the bid of the Complainant. The complainant was informed about the cancellation also. Thus, there was no deficiency in service on the part of the OPs.
8.      This view dovetails from the decision in the case Delhi Development Authority v. Parveen Kumar & Ors. II (2015) CPJ 36 (NC, it was observed :
12. As far as the person, who obtains for allotment of a built up flat/developed plot is concerned if the statutory authority does not undertake an obligation to carry out any further development activity such as providing or augmenting infrastructure or is not required to render any other service in connection with such allotment, he will not be a consumer within the meaning of the Act. If however, the sale/allotment of builtup flats/developed plots is accompanied by such an obligation on the part of the concerned development authority, the purchaser would be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
13. As far as a person who applies for allotment of a plot/flat is concerned, he will not be a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Act, if neither any allotment is made to him nor he is registered for and awaiting such an allotment. Such a person cannot be said to have hired or availed the services of the concerned development authority in connection with housing. Mere submission of an application for allotment, which does not result either in allotment or registration and consequent inclusion in the awaiting list for such an allotment, does not confer upon him the status of a ‘consumer’ as defined under Section 2(1)(d) of the said Act.
9.      I find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned. There is no illegality or jurisdictional error in the order passed by State Commission warranting interference in revisional jurisdiction under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Accordingly, the order of the State Commission is affirmed.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      Brief facts: The complainant Mr. Pravin Juneja availed home loan sanctioned by the ICICI Bank (OP) for a sum of Rs. 74,00,000/- for a period of 10 years (120 months) qua a property located in Greater Kailash. The monthly instalment fixed was Rs. 93,741/- as the EMI. The loan was to end in February, 2015. The complainant alleged that he kept on paying the EMIs even after the stipulated time period on the demand of the OP. The complainant requested for a no due certificate, upon which he learnt that the OP was charging exorbitant rate of interest on the loan and it was at floating rate and not as per the rate agreed. The complainant had to pay Rs. 1,18,24,421/- instead of Rs. 1,12,48,920/-. The complainant paid an excessive amount of Rs. 5,75,501/- to the OP. Being aggrieved, a complaint was filed on 05.04.2016 before the State Commission. After filing the complaint, the OP bank issued a demand letter dated 16.05.2016 to pay arrears of Rs. 6,09,034/- inclusive of interest upto 12.05.2016. Therefore, the complainant filed an application before the State Commission for staying the operation and the demand letter dated 16.05.2016.
2.      The OP bank filed the written statement and submitted that the complaint and the said application are not maintainable under the SERFAESI Act (Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002). Only floating rate of interest was applicable and the loan was against the property. The OP bank did not collect excess amount from the complainant. It contended that interference by the State Commission would cause sever prejudice to the OP bank and the purpose of SERFAESI Act, 2002 and DRT Act (Debt Recovery Tribunal Act) would be defeated.
3.      The State Commission after hearing both the parties and considering the evidence on record, dismissed the application and the matter was further listed on 04.12.2017 for rejoinder and evidence by affidavit to be filed by the complainant within eight weeks with advance copy to the OP bank.
4.      The State Commission while dismissing the application, made the following observations:
3. …xxx… in clause (E) dealing with interest it has been mentioned that ICICI Bank floating reference rate 8.5% per annum on the date of execution of said agreement. He insisted on use of word ‘floating’ which means that it was not a fixed rate of interest. Rather it was to vary according to the rates approved by RBI from time to time. On the next page i. e. page 41 in clause (G) dealing with amortization term of payment it has been mentioned as 120 months with a * above the word months. The * has been explained at the bottom by mentioning subject to variation of terms of agreement. Thus the period of 120 months was open to variation with a change in the rate of interest.
4.       Counsel for OP also drew our attention to letter dated 01.07.15 by OP which is at page 41 of the bunch of WS filed by the OP. Vide this letter OP informed the complainant that benchmark reference rate (FRR)* of ICICI Bank loans with floating rate of interest has decreased by 0.25% w. e. f. April 10, 2015 and further decreased by 0.05% w. e. f. June 26, 2015. In view of the same rate of interest for complainant’s loan has been revised by 16.2% per annum. * has been explained at the bottom by mentioning that FRR denotes floating reference rate which is reviewed periodically.
…xxx…
8. …xxx… Thus we find that the complaint has no prima facie case. If the OP is able to recover the amount, and the action of the OP is found to be illegal complainant can recover the same from the bank. OP is a bank and not individual from whom recovery would be difficult. Thus the complainant would not suffer any irreparable loss. The loss would be ascertained amount of money. Balance of convenience also lies in favour of the OP as it intends to recover the amount which is apparently recoverable by it.
(extracts of paras 3,4 and 8 of the State Commission’s Order)
5.      The complainant being aggrieved by the dismissal of the application, preferred the instant first appeal.
6.      We have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the material on record.
7.      On bare perusal of the letter dated 29.02.2016 of the OP bank depicts that the loan of Rs. 74,00,000/- was sanctioned with a Floating Rate of Interest (FRR 8.25 % + Margin 0.75 %) i.e 9 % p.a. payable in 120 months (10 years), and the tabulation also mentions about the changes in the FRR on various dates. The letter also tabulates the changes in the FRR on various dates.
8.      On the basis of the foregoing discussion, we dismiss the First Appeal. It is needless to state that the order of the State Commission is hereby affirmed.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
","9.     The short point in this case is that a complaint case, being c.c. no. 362 of 2016, is under adjudication before the State Commission. The complainant filed an application seeking interim protection apropos a demand letter issued by the opposite party bank. The State Commission, for reasons recorded, dismissed the said application. Aggrieved therewith, the complainant filed the instant appeal before this Commission.
10.    It is noted that the complaint case is before the forum of original jurisdiction, i.e. the State Commission, it is pending adjudication. Vide its impugned Order of 07.07.2017, the interim protection from recovery, sought by the complainant, was not provided, the application was dismissed, and the matter was posted for further proceedings. The opposite party is a bank (ICICI Bank Ltd.), which functions under the superintendence of the central bank, the RBI. The complaint has as yet to be adjudicated on merit. The complainant will not be left remediless if the interim protection is not provided; in the contingency that his complaint succeeds, the relief can be quantified in monetary terms and ordered so. The bank’s case before the State Commission is that it is recovering the money due from the complainant in the normal wont of its functioning. It is nowhere discernible, at this stage in the proceedings before the State Commission, that the complainant is being singled out for discrimination or is being differently treated from similarly situate persons by the bank. In such facts and situation, we agree with the State Commission that the balance of convenience lies in favour of the opposite party bank and that interim protection from recovery is unwarranted.
11.    With this brief discussion, the appeal is dismissed. The State Commission is requested to adjudicate the complaint case on merit as per the law. It goes without saying that the complainant (as well as the opposite party bank) would be free, if either or both so choose, to agitate the State Commission’s findings before this Commission under Section 19 of the Act 1986 as per the law.

","PER MR PREM NARAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
This appeal has been filed against the judgment dated 13.10.2014 of the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Mumbai in Complaint no.CC/09/2.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the father of the respondent/ complainant took four personal accident insurance policies from the appellant/ opposite party – Royal Sundram Alliance Co. Ltd., with the following details:
S no.
Policy no. and Period
Sum assured
1.
PE00085132000100-E049 dated 04.04.2007 to 03.03.2009
Rs,4,00,000/-
2.

4.
PE00084865000100-E049 dated 26.03.2007 to 25.03.2009
Rs.4,00,000/-
3.     During the currency of these policies the life assured visited Kailash Mansarovar along with his family. It is the case of the complainant that when the insured was climbing the “icy kailash paravat”, he fell down on 05.09.2007 and sustained injury. The insured was brought to Mumbai on 06.09.2007 and was admitted in Nanavati Hospital, Mumbai where his one leg was amputated due to gangrene. After being discharged from the Nanavati Hospital on 02.10.2007 he was again admitted to Hinduja Hospital on 15.10.2007 and he was discharged from the Hinduja Hospital on 22.10.2007. Due to loss of blood, he became very weak and ultimately the insured died on 03.12.2007. The insurance claim was submitted by the complainant to the insurance company after the amputation of one leg and the claim under the policies was repudiated vide letter dated 09.01.2008 which reads as under:
“We refer to a letter dated 22.10.2007 with regard to the claim preferred over the policies taken for Mr Harish Ramchandani.
On scrutiny of the hospital records, it is noted that the insured developed Gangrene due to exposure to the cold temperature, this is also confirmed by our service provider in his report on Hospital Cash claim lodged for the same incident.
We reproduce the policy conditions:
The company shall not be liable for payment of compensation in respect of death, injury or disablement of the insured person as a result of, or which is contributed to by, the insured person suffering from any pre-existing condition or pre-existing physical or mental defect or infirmity. Pre-existing condition shall mean any ailment which existed prior to the effective date of this insurance.
There is no evidence of accidental injury mentioned in the hospital record, further, the disablement is not due to accident but it is due to the pre-existing diabetes.
In view of the above, we are unable to consider your claim and we sincerely regret our inability to assist you on this occasion.”
4.     Aggrieved by the repudiation of the insurance claim under all the four policies, the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the State Commission being CC no.CC/09/2. The complaint was resisted by the insurance company mainly on two grounds that there was no proof of accident and the deceased life assured (DLA) did not disclose the fact that he was suffering from diabetes mellitus which was the cause of gangrene which caused the death of the insured. However, the State Commission accepted the complaint and passed the following order:
“Complaint is partly allowed.
Opponent insurance company is directed to pay to the complainant a sum of Rs.26,02,885.30 as detailed below:
Particulars
Amount in Rupees
(a)
The sum insured admissible on account of death of the insured under policies mentioned in the paragraph no.21
Rs.22,00,000/-
(b)

Rs.3,87,885.30
(c )
Towards transportation charges
Rs.15,000/-
TOTAL
Rs.26,02,885.30
Opponent Insurance Company is directed to pay to the complainant the above-mentioned amount of Rs.26,02,885.30 along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of this complaint, i.e., from 05.01.2009 within a period of two months from today, failing which interest @ 12% per annum shall be payable by the opponent insurance company to the complainant from the date of filing of the complaint, i.e., from 05.01.2009 till realisation.

Opponent insurance company is directed to pay to the complainant a sum of Rs.35,000/- as costs of this complaint”.
5.     Hence, the present appeal.
6.     Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record. Learned counsel for the appellant has stated that allegedly the DLA had fallen while climbing the icy Kailash parvat on 05.09.2007 and he was brought to the Nanavati Hospital on 06.09.2007. A certificate has been given by the Nanavati Hospital on 06.09.2007 which reads as under:
TOWHOMSOEVER IT MAY CONCERN
This is regarding Mr Harish Ramchandani, 64 years old male.
As history given by the patient and his relatives, he is a k/c/o diabetes and hypertensive and _____. He was in the Mansarovar few days back where he had exposure and cold climate and water. There he developed cyanosis c inability to move his ® leg associated c pain 5-6 days back c shortness of breath and facial swelling and puffiness for that he went to the Kathmandu at Norvic Escort International Hospital. He has been investigated over there where the patient count – 1,28,000, BT – 2’30 s, CT – 9 min, Hb – 12.3, TLC-11600, ESR – 32, RBS – 126, Urea – 177, Creatinine – 7.8, Sodium – 13, Potassium  - 5 (ov/7/07)
Arterial Doppler (04/09/07) – Acute thrombosis of popliteal anterior and posterior hibcal arteries (o) lower limb. There is absent color flowin mid/ distal anterior hbial artery of (L) Lower Limb monophere flow in primial anterial hbial artery. He advised amputation of (R ) lower limb which is gangreneous in Norvic Escort Hospital. He refused for operation and shifted to Bombay with some medication”.
7.     From the above certificate it will be seen that nothing has been mentioned about the fall of the DLA on icy kailash parvat. The insured was taken to Norvic Escort International Hospital at Nepal, Kathmandu. However, no record of treatment of that hospital or medical examination papers have been filed by the complainant in this regard to verify whether there was any fall suffered by the DLA or not. This was a crucial evidence which could have established whether any accident was suffered by the DLA. In the absence of any medical record from the Norvic Escort International Hospital in Nepal or any other record of treatment undertaken by the DLA, the incident of accidental fall cannot be established. The State Commission has wrongly attributed the death of the DLA on account of the alleged accident. The fact is that the DLA was suffering from Diabetes and High Blood Pressure for about 10 years as given in the discharge summary of Nanavati Hospital. The same is being corroborated by the certificate dated 06.09.2007 which mentions that the patient and his relatives had informed that the patient is a known case of diabetes Mellitus. Thus it is clear that the DLA had suppressed the information in respect of his pre-existing disease of diabetes Mellitus. This non-disclosure becomes more serious as death has happened due to gangrene as alleged by the complainant, though, there is no such evidence filed by the complainant. The DLA was discharged from the Nanavati Hospital on 02.10.2007 and was again admitted to Hinduja Hospital on 15.10.1007 and he was discharged from the Hinduja Hospital on 22.10.2007. This clearly means that he had recovered after the amputation from the Nanavati Hospital by 02.10.2007, and again he was admitted with certain complications in the Hinduja Hospital and he was their only for seven days and thereafter he was discharged. The DLA suffered mainly due to diabetes mellitus as gangrene could develop in a diabetic person fast and easily. Firstly, there is no proof that the DLA died due to gangrene which can be associated with the alleged fall of DLA at Kailash  Manasarover. Obviously, the DLA was not suffering from gangrene or its effects after amputation was done. The DLA was finally discharged from the Hinduja Hospital on 22.10.2007. The DLA had died on 03.12.2007 and this means that from 22.10.2007 till his death, the DLA was not suffering from gangrene. Gangrene in fact was a complication developed in the body of DLA due to diabetes and hypertension, therefore, his death can be either due to some other reason/ disease or even if it was caused due to other complications having been developed from gangrene, none of the reasons seems to be related to the alleged accident. Thus the claim of the complainant is not payable as it has not been caused by any accident as no proof has been filed for the accident and on account of the pre-existing disease, the DLA suffered from gangrene and his leg was amputated and finally the DLA expired after about two months after having been discharged after amputation.
8.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant has stated that one of the family members has filed an affidavit indicating the facts and circumstances of the case. It was further stated that if his hands and legs are exposed to severe cold then that would also be an accident. Photographs have been filed showing the exposure of hands and legs of the deceased. The insurance company has not filed the copies of the proposal form of all these policies. Thus, on what basis, the insurance company alleged that the deceased has suppressed information in respect of the disease of diabetes. The State Commission has considered all the aspects and has considered all the objections raised by the insurance company but has found them frivolous and untenable. Learned counsel for the respondent complainant has stated that though in the certificate dated 06.09.2007 given by the Nanavati Hospital, there is no mention of fall of the deceased at Kailash Paravat but, another certificate dated 05.07.2008 has been issued by the same hospital wherein it is mentioned that the deceased had history of fall at Kailash Parvat. The said certificate issued by the Nanavati Hospital reads as under:
“This is to certify that:
65 year old male Mr Harish J Ramchandani was admitted here on 06.09.2007 with alleged history of fall at Kailash Parvat on religious pilgrimage with chief complaints of severe pain in both the lower limbs. Since fall, patient had acute discoloration of Rt Lower Limb.
Clinically, patient had ischemic changes of Rt Lower Limb with compromised vascularity and absent pt dorslis pelvis pulsatin with reduced sanction over, rt lower limb due to fall leading to sudden exposure to extreme of cold temperature. Clinical findings were confirmed by Angiography and other investigations. Patient had to undergo Right side above knee amputation in too stage surgery which lead to total permanent disability. Left lower limb was managed conservatively. Patient was discharged on 02.10.2007”.
9.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined the material on record. All the policies taken by the deceased were personal accident policies and the accident at any place was covered under them. The important question to be answered in the present appeal is whether disability or death was caused due to any accident or not. It is the case of the complainant that the deceased went to Kailash Mansarover and he fell down somewhere, which resulted in the exposure of his hands and legs due to extreme cold prevailing there and which resulted into the development of gangrene in his right lower limb and ultimately the leg was amputated. Further complications led to the death of the insured. The complainant has not filed any medical treatment papers of Norvic Escort Hospital, Kathamandu, Nepal. Those treatment papers would have provided the evidence to prove that the deceased had a fall resulting into exposure to extreme cold. The certificate dated 05.07.2008 given by the Nanavati Hospital is a subsequent certificate which must have been given at the request of the complainant clearly mentioning the fall of the deceased at Kailash Parvat. The first certificate issued by the Nanavati Hospital dated 06.09.2007 does not indicate anything in respect of the fall of the deceased at Kailash Parvat. This certificate clearly mentions that the patient was having problem in his leg since 5-6 days back, i.e., since 1st or 2nd September 2007 and this certificate also mentions that he was advised amputation of his right lower limb in Norvic Escort International Hospital at Kathamandu. However, he preferred to get himself shifted to Mumbai for further treatment. The assertion of the complainant that the insured had a fall on 05.09.2007 is falsified from this certificate as this certificate reveals that the trouble started on 1st or 2nd September 2007 and he took the treatment at Norivc Escort International Hospital at Kathamandu, Nepal. It seems that in order to get the insurance claim, certain material facts have been suppressed by the complainant. Clearly, the details of the activities from 1st to 5th September 2007 at Kathamandu could have given an insight into the whole case and would have helped in deciding the present complaint particularly, whether the amputation of the right lower limb and consequently the death of the insured was a consequence of some accident. The fact that insured was advised amputation of right lower limb at Norvic Escort International Hospital at Kathamandu, Nepal itself, reveals that the insured was suffering from diabetes for a long time. The discharge summary of Hinduja hospital also does not mention anything about the accident in Nepal. Clearly, the complainant has procured another certificate from Nanavati Hospital dated 05.07.2008, wherein the hospital has recorded the history of fall of insured at Kailash Parvat resulting in exposure to extreme cold. This document seems to have been given by the hospital only on the basis of whatever was told by the complainant or the relatives of the deceased to the hospital authorities which is contradictory to the information given by the insured and his relatives at the time of admission to Nanavati Hospital as mentioned in the certificate dated 05.09.2007 of the hospital. This certificate does not have more value than the statement of the complainant.
10.   In the present case, two aspects are involved. The first is with regard to suppressing information about the existing disease of diabetes and the second is regarding the accident. The fact is that the amputation of right lower limb was advised even before the insured was shifted to Nanavati Hospital due to gangrene. The pre-existing disease of diabetes is self-evident. However, as no proposal form has been filed by the insurance company, it cannot be said that the insured did not provide information about his disease in the proposal form. Therefore, this allegation of the insurance company cannot be sustained.
11.   The next point is about the accident. From the above examination, I am of the view, that no proof has been filed by the complainant to establish the factum of an accident in the present case, rather, there are certain facts which prove that the complainant has not come with clean hands to file the present complaint. It seems that purposely, no record of treatment at Norvic Escort International Hospital, Kathamandu, Nepal has been filed so that the real initial position could not be known to the consumer forum. The complainant has stated that the insured had fallen on 05.09.2007, whereas the certificate dated 05.09.2007 clearly states that the insured started suffering from 1st to 2nd September 2007 as examined earlier. As the complainant has not come with clean hands, the complainant may not be entitled for any relief as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Tata Motors Ltd. & anr. Vs. Hazoor Maharaj Baba Des Rajji Chela Baba Dewa Singhji (Radha Swami), 2013 SCC ONLine NCDRC 883 as under:-
","“15. In the light of above observations, we find that as complainant did not remain consumer after sale of vehicle and he has sold the vehicle without permission of the District Forum and has suppressed this fact and has not approached the courts with clean hands, complaint is liable to be dismissed and revision petition is to be allowed.” .
12.   It is true that the right lower limb of the insured was amputated and finally due to other complications the insured died on 03.12.2007, but the present policies are in respect of personal accident and these will be attracted only when death or permanent disability has been caused due to accident. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, the accident has not been proved and therefore, insurance claims under the policies are not payable.
13.    Based on the above discussion, I find merit in the present appeal and accordingly, the appeal no.1456 of 2014 is allowed and the order of the State Commission dated 13.10.2014 is set aside and the complaint is dismissed.

Thereafter, an agreement was executed between the parties on 23.4.2013.  Clause 3.1 of the agreement related to delivery of the possession reads as under:
“3.1   Subject to Clause 10 herein or any other circumstances not anticipated and beyond the reasonable control of the Seller and any restraints / restrictions form any courts / authorities and subject to the Purchaser(s) having complied with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and not being in default under any of the provisions of this Agreement and having complied with all provisions, formalities, documentation, etc., as prescribed by the Seller, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, from time to time, the Seller proposes to hand over the possession of the Apartment to the Purchaser(s) within a period of 42 months with an additional grace period of six months from the date of execution of this Agreement or date of obtaining all licenses or approvals for commencement of construction, whichever is later, subject to Force Majeure.  The purchase (s) agrees and understands that the Seller shall be entitled to a grace period of 90 business days, after the expiry of grace period, for offer to hand over the possession of the Apartment to the Purchaser.  Any application for the occupation certificate in respect of the Project shall be filed in the due course.  The seller shall give Notice of Offer of possession in writing to the Purchaser with regard to the handing over of possession, where after, within thirty days the purchaser shall clear his outstanding dues and complete documentary formalities and take physical possession of the Apartment.  In case, the purchaser (s) raises any issue with respect to any demand, the same would not entitle the purchaser (s) for an extension of the time for taking over possession of the apartment.  In the event the purchaser fails to make all payments and accept and take the possession of the apartment the apartment within thirty days of the Notice of Officer of Possession  the purchaser shall be deemed to be custodian of the apartment from such due date indicated in the Notice of Officer of Possession and the apartment shall be held by the Seller solely at the risks and costs of the Purchaser, including but not limited to applicability of the appropriate Holding Charges as defined in Clause 3.3 below and interest.  The obligation of the seller to offer possession to the purchaser under this clause shall be subject to Force Majeure.”
2.      It would thus be seen that the possession was to be delivered within a period of 48 months, including the grace period of six months and the said period was to be computed from the date of execution of the agreement or the date on which all the licenses or approvals required for commencement of the construction were obtained, whichever was later.  The builder was also entitled to a further grace period of 90 business days for handing over possession of the apartment to the complainants.
3.      The grievance of the complainants is that even the construction of the apartment is not complete till date, though they have already made payment of more than Rs.70 lakhs to the developer.  The complainants are therefore, before this Commission seeking refund of the amount paid by them to the developer along with interest, compensation etc.
4.      The complaint has been resisted by the OP which has taken two preliminary objections.  The first preliminary objection taken by the OP is that the complaint is barred by limitation and the second preliminary objection as taken by the developer is that this Commission does not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.  On merits, it is alleged that the complainants had defaulted in payment of the installments, which were linked with the stage of construction despite demand letters and show cause notice having been issued to them.  It is however, not disputed in the written version that the construction of the Tower in which the flat allotted to the complainants is located, is not completed though, the occupancy certificate in respect of Tower A to D of the project is annexed to the written version of the OP.
5.      As far as limitation is concerned, since the OP did not deliver or even offer the possession of the allotted flat to the complainants at any point of time and even today, the OP does not have the occupancy certificate in respect of Tower ‘E’ in which the allotted flat is located, the complainants had a recurrent cause of action to take a consumer complaint.  A reference in this regard can be made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Meerut Development Authority Vs. Mukesh Kumar Gupta [IV(2012) CPJ 12 (SC)].
6.      As far as pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned, in terms of Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, this Commission had pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain a consumer complaint where the value of the goods or the services, as the case may be, and the compensation, if any, claimed in the complaint exceeded Rs.1.00 crores.  As held by a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla Vs. Ferrous Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. CC No. 97 of 2016, decided on 07.10.2016, the value of the services in such a case would mean the sale price agreed to be paid by the Flat Buyers to the Builder.  The sale price of this flat was more than Rs.95.00 lacs as is evident from a perusal of the payment plan filed by the OP itself.  If compensation in the form of simple interest is added to the aforesaid amount, the aggregate becomes more than Rs.1.00 crore.  Therefore, this Commission has the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain and decide this complaint.
7.      Coming to the merits of the case, the payment plan agreed between the parties and incorporate in the agreement executed between them reads as under:

8.      Vide his email dated 17.11.2015, the complainants requested the OP to permit them to pay 25% of the outstanding demand at that time which came to Rs.2.14 lacs and promised to pay the balance amount at the time of possession, on the ground that the bank had not released further loan to them.  Vide email dated 07.12.2015, the OP agreed that the complainants need to pay only Rs.1,80,000/- at that time, followed by payment of Rs.8.00 lacs in June, 2016 and the rest of the payment could be made on possession.  Thus, the complainants were required to pay only Rs.1,80,000/- before June, 2016 when they were to make further payment of Rs.8.00 lacs.  The complainants paid the aforesaid amount of Rs.1,80,000/- immediately after receipt of the aforesaid email and the cheque was encashed on 10.12.2015.
9.      It is true that the complainants did not make payment of Rs.8.00 lacs to the developer in June, 2016 in terms of the email of the developer dated 07.12.2015.  The case of the complainants is that when they visited the site, they found that the construction work had come to a halt and that was the reason they did not make payment of Rs.8.00 lacs in June, 2016.  The demands upto the stage of completion of electric conduiting had already been raised by the OP by the time the above referred email dated 7.12.2015 was sent.  The next installment was payable on completion of the flooring.  There is no evidence of the said demand having been raised by the OP even by the time the written version to the consumer complaint was filed on 09.8.2019.  The statement of accounts annexed to the written version clearly indicates that the flooring had not been completed by the time the said statement of accounts was filed with the written version.  This would mean that the OP had not been able to complete the flooring in more than three years and eight months which had expired by the time the written version as filed.  This clearly indicates that the construction work had totally stopped at the site as is alleged by the complainants.  Had the construction work not come to standstill, the OP would have been able to complete the flooring within a view months of sending the email dated 07.12.2015.  Therefore, the complainants are absolutely right in saying that they did not make payment of Rs.8.00 lacs in June, 2016 on account of they having noticed, on a site visit, that the construction work had been halted and had come to a standstill.  A person who has already paid more than Rs.70.00 lacs to the builder cannot keep on making further payment and thereby sinking more and more money in a project which he does not see being completed in near future.  The OP had already received more than Rs.70.00 lacs from the complainants out of the total sale price of above Rs.95.00 lacs.  There was no reason for the OP not to even complete the flooring within a few months of the writing the email dated 07.12.2015.  The complainants, therefore, were justified in not making the payment, which the OP wanted them to make in June, 2016.  Had the complainants made that payment, the principal amount payable by the OP to them would have increased by Rs.8.00 lacs, without any benefit to the complainants.  Therefore, the failure of the complainants to make payment of Rs.8.00 lacs to the OP in June, 2016 was fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the case as noted hereinabove.
10.    As noted earlier, the possession was expected to be delivered by the complainants within a period of four years form the commencement date.  If the date of execution of the agreement i.e. 23.4.2013 is taken as the commencement date, the possession ought to have been offered by 23.4.2017.  There has already been a delay of almost 3 ½ years and even today the OP is not in a position to offer possession of the allotted flat to the complainants on having not obtained the requisite occupancy certificate in respect of Tower E in which the flat allotted to the complainants is located.  The complainants cannot be compelled to wait indefinitely for the possession of the allotted flat and are entitled to seek refund of the amount which they paid to the OP along with appropriate compensation in the form of interest etc.
11.    A reference in this regard can be made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghavan & Connected Matter  (2019) 5 SCC 725 and the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Devasis Rudra II (2019) CPJ 29 (SC).
In Devasis Rudra (supra), the possession was offered to the complainant/appellant during the pendency of the complaint before the State Commission and it was contended that the said builder having made substantial investment in terms of the agreement, a direction for refund was not warranted.  In the Consumer Complaint filed in Devasis Rudra (supra), the complainant/appellant had prayed for possession of the house and in the alternative, for refund of the amount paid by him to the developer.  In view of the said prayer made in the Consumer Complaint, it was argued on behalf of the builder that he should be made to accept possession of the allotted house and refund and not be allowed to him.  The complainant, on the other hand, contended that at the time the Consumer Complaint was filed, he was ready and willing to accept the possession, but seven years having elapsed, he was not more willing to accept possession.  Allowing the appeal, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:
“It would be manifestly unreasonable to construe the contract between the parties as requiring the buyer to wait indefinitely for possession.  By 2016, nearly seven years had elapsed from the date of the agreement. Even according to the developer, the completion certificate was received on 29 March 2016.  This was nearly seven years after the extended date for the handing over of possession prescribed by the agreement.  A buyer can be expected to wait for possession for a reasonable period. A period of seven years is beyond what is reasonable. Hence, it would have been manifestly unfair to non-suit the buyer merely on the basis of the first prayer in the reliefs sought before the SCDRC.  There was in any event a prayer for refund.”
In Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. (supra), the builder submitted before this Commission itself that since the construction of the apartment was complete and Occupancy Certificate had been obtained, the flat purchaser must be directed to accept the possession instead of directing refund of the amount deposited.  In that case, there was a delay of about three years in offering possession and the flat purchaser had submitted that he was not interested in taking possession after delay of about three years.  He also stated that he had taken an alternative property in Gurgaon.  This Commission having allowed refund to the complainant/respondent, the appellant before the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia contended that as per the terms of the agreement executed between the parties, the flat purchaser could claim refund only after expiry of twelve months from the grace period by terminating the agreement but the Consumer Complaint had been filed even before the said twelve months period after the grace period had come to an end.  It was also submitted on behalf of the builder that this Commission had erred in granting interest at the rate of 10.7% per annum to the complainant when the agreement between the parties provided for payment of interest @ 6% per annum in case of delay in handing over possession.  Rejecting the contentions advanced by the builder, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:
6.1. In the present case, admittedly the Appellant – Builder obtained the Occupancy Certificate almost 2 years after the date stipulated in the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement. As a consequence, there was a failure to hand over possession of the flat to the Respondent – Flat Purchaser within a reasonable period. The Occupancy Certificate was obtained after a delay of more than 2 years on 28.08.2018 during the pendency of the proceedings before the National Commission.
In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta,2 this Court held that when a person hires the services of a builder, or a contractor, for the construction of a house or a flat, and the same is for a consideration, it is a “service” as defined by Section 2 (o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The inordinate delay in handing over possession of the flat clearly amounts to deficiency of service.
In Fortune Infrastructure & Anr. v. Trevor D’Lima & Ors.,3 this Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the flat allotted to him, and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid by him, along with compensation.
6.2. The Respondent – Flat Purchaser has made out a clear case of deficiency of service on the part of the Appellant – Builder. The Respondent – Flat Purchaser was justified in terminating the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement by filing the Consumer Complaint, and cannot be compelled to accept the possession whenever it is offered by the Builder. The Respondent – Purchaser was legally entitled to seek refund of the money deposited by him along with appropriate compensation.
","12.   For the reasons stated hereinabove the complaint is disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      The OP shall refund the entire principal amount of Rs.70,33,103/- to the complainants.
(ii)      On the amount taken as a housing loan by the complainants from ICICI Bank, the OP shall pay as compensation such interest as is paid by the complainant to the ICICI Bank.  On the rest of the amount, which the complainants contributed from their own resources, compensation in the form of simple interest shall be payable @ 9% per annum from the date of each payment till the date of refund.
(iii)     The OP shall pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- as cost of litigation to the complainants.
(iv)    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within six months form today, subject to the OP filing an undertaking of its Managing Director within three months form today, undertaking therein to comply with the order of this Commission in all respects within six months from today.  If such an undertaking is not filed, the order passed by this Commission shall be executable on expiry of three months from today.

  For the Complainant     :For the Complainants		: Mr. U.C. Mittal, Advocate 
  For the Opp.Party      :For the Opposite Party		: Mr. Sudeep Singh, Advocate 
","R.K. AGRAWAL, J., PRESIDENT
The brief facts as set out in the Complaint are that the Complainants, lured by advertisements made by the Opposite Party in various daily newspapers having circulation in the NCR, including oral representations by the representatives of the Opposite Party regarding its project “Prateek Edifice” located at Plot No.GH-01/A (Beta-2) Sector 107,
Noida District Gautam Budhnagar (U.P.) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Project’), had booked a residential flat bearing No.E-1510 on 14th Floor, in Tower E, having super covered area 4300 sq. ft. (built up area 3530 sq. ft.) including two Double Deck Mechanical Parking and power back up upto 10 KVA, etc., in the said Project, for a total consideration of Rs.3,30,65,800/- on 01-03-2015. It is averred that the Opposite Party had also proposed a subvention scheme in respect of the Project, whereby the Opposite Party was to arrange housing loan upto the extent of 80% of the total sale consideration from HDFC Ltd. and balance was to be paid by the Buyer. The Opposite Party made an offer to the Complainants that it would arrange a housing loan from the HDFC Ltd. which was associated with the Opposite Party and also bear the interest liability on the loan amount of Rs.2.49 Crores, to be obtained by the Complainants from the bank, for the next 24 months, i.e., for a period of three months beyond the proposed date of handing over of possession of the flat in December, 2016.
2.       It was represented by the Opposite Party that pursuant to all the necessary permissions and sanctions obtained by it, they had been constructing Blocks Nos.A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H in the Project.  Subsequently, vide Allotment Letter dated 19-03-2015 the afore-said flat was allotted to the Complainants by the Opposite Party.
3.       It is averred that the terms & conditions stipulated in the said Allotment Letter dated 19-03-2015 were completely in favour of the Opposite Party. As per Clause 43 of the Allotment Letter, the possession of the flat was to be given to the Complainants in December 2016 with a grace period of five months; however, in case of non-handing over of the possession, even during the grace period, the damages were to be paid from the committed date of possession i.e. December 2016. The Complainants averred that the amount of Rs.5/- per sq. ft. fixed by the Opposite Party in the Allotment Letter touted to be as ‘damages’, were not actually damages but an incentive to the Opposite Party since calculating the so-called damages at the rate of Rs.5/- per sq. ft. would come to a meagre amount of Rs.21,500/- on monthly basis on an amount of Rs.3.30 Crores to be paid to the Opposite Party by the Complainants.
4.       Pursuant to the Allotment Letter, a Tripartite Agreement was entered into between the Opposite Party, the Complainants and the HDFC Ltd., wherein the Opposite Party made a commitment to pay interest to the HDFC Ltd. till December 2016.
5.       The Complainants paid all the instalments in time as per Allotment Letter dated 19-03-2015 and there was no default of any instalment by them at any point of time. They complied with all the terms & conditions of the Allotment Letter and paid an amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/- to the Opposite Party by 09-08-2016. In terms of the allotment, the balance amount was to be paid at the time of handing over of possession of the flat. The Complainants were ready and willing to perform their part of the contract under the Allotment Letter dated 19-03-2015 by making payment of balance sale consideration payable at the time of handing over of possession and to take over the possession on the due date of possession of the said flat i.e. on or before 31-12-2016. However, the Opposite Party failed to complete the Project and to deliver the possession of the subject flat to the Complainants on or before 31-12-2016 as promised in the Allotment Letter dated 19-03-2015. The Complainants made several visits to the site of the Project and interacted with the representatives of the Opposite Party regarding handing over of the possession of the flat in question and also went through a number of advertisements subsequently issued by the Opposite Party promising that the possession of the flats will definitely be handed over in 2017.  By sending an email on 01-03-2017 to the Opposite Party, the Complainants informed their plight to the Opposite Party, while clearly stating that there is absolutely no possibility of completion of construction in near future. The Opposite Party by its reply email dated 22-03-2017 stated that the case will be discussed with the management. However, no reply came and the Opposite Party failed to address any grievance of the Complainants. The Complainants kept on following up with the Opposite Party; however, to no avail and no concrete answer was given by the Opposite Party to any of the queries raised by the Complainants.
6.       Complainants sent another email dated 14-03-2018 to the Opposite Party and brought it to the notice of the Opposite Party that the construction was going on at extremely slow pace and it may take more than a year to complete the construction, but no reply came from the Opposite Party. Thereafter, another email dated 10-05-2018 was written by the Complainants calling for reply from the Opposite Party regarding the possible date of completion of the Project. The Complainants also enquired about the date of handing over of the possession and execution of Sale Deed after obtaining Completion Certificate from the competent authority, but no reply was received from the Opposite Party. Feeling aggrieved, Complainants have filed this Consumer Complaint praying directions to the Opposite Party:
(i)      to complete the Project expeditiously, complete in all respects, and to obtain Competition Certificate from the Competent Authority as well as to execute the conveyance deed and hand over vacant and peaceful possession to the Complainants within such period as may be fixed by this Hon’ble Commission;
(ii)     to pay an amount of Rs.66,47,165/- to the Complainants towards interest at the rate of 18% per annum, accrued since 01-04-2017 till the date of filing of Complaint on the amount paid by the Complainants from time to time together with pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 18% per annum, till the date of actual payment by the Opposite Party;
(iii)    to continue to pay interest @18% p.a. on an amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/- from 29-06-2018 (date of filing of Complaint) till the date of execution of conveyance deed and handing over of possession;
(iv)    to pay damages to the Complainants to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- for mental agony and harassment;
(v)     to pay further interest @15% p.a. on the amounts calculated under prayer (iii) and (iv), in case of non-compliance of the said prayers within the time frame fixed by this Hon’ble Commission, till the date of actual payment/realization; or, in the alternative,
(i)      to refund to the Complainants the amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/- together with pendente lite and future interest @18% per annum from the date of respective payments till the date of actual payment or realization thereof and
(ii)     costs of the present Complaint be awarded in favour of Complainants and against the Opposite Party.
7.       Upon notice, the Opposite Party contested the Complaint by filing its Written Version contending that the Complainants were entitled to the possession of the flat by December, 2016 with a grace period of five months, i.e. May, 2017, subject to the Force Majeure events. The Project got delayed due to the order of the Government authorities. The State of U.P. had issued a Notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 on 11-09-2008 pursuant to which the land measuring 227.077 hectare of Village Salarpur Khadar, Pargana- Dadri, Tehsil Dadri, District Gautam Budh Nagar was notified for acquisition. Subsequently on 30-09-2008 a Declaration under Section 6 (1) was issued in this regard. Thereafter, in the year 2010, NOIDA floated a Scheme [Scheme Code-GH-2010-(I)] for allotment of land for development of Group Housing Complexes. Plot No. GH-01, Sector-107, Noida, admeasuring 2,27,941.95 sq. mtr. was allotted to a consortium out of which a sub-divided part admeasuring 27,941.95 sq. mtr. and numbered as GH-01/A (Beta-2) was allotted/transferred in favour of M/s. Three C Realtors Pvt. Ltd. on 15-02-2012. Subsequently, on 06-08-2012, share holding of M/s Three C Realtors Pvt. Ltd. was acquired by M/s. Prateek Buildtech (India) Pvt. Ltd. & M/s Prateek Infraprojects India Pvt. Ltd.. The Opposite Party had since initiated the development of the Project from the year 2012.
8.       It is further contended in the Written Version that the Opposite Party came to know in July 2014 that a Writ Petition bearing No.66604/2009 titled as Rajendra Estate Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of UP & Ors. was filed in the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad, whereby the above Notification issued under Section 4(1) dated 11-09-2008 & declaration dated 30-09-2008 were challenged. The said Writ Petition was dismissed on 24-09-2010 by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court and interim order was vacated. On 05-08-2013, a Civil Appeal No.6353 of 2013 [Arising out of SLP (Civil) No.29318 of 2010] directed against order dated 24-09-2010 passed by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the above said Writ Petition was allowed. The impugned order dated 24-09-2010 was set aside and Notifications dated 11-09-2008 & 30-09-2009 in respect of land acquisition in Village Salarpur, Gautam Budh Nagar were quashed.
9.       Based on the aforesaid orders, further Writ Petitions were filed on 30-06-2014. The Hon’ble Allahabad High Court directed all the parties to maintain status quo in respect of the land where acquisition proceedings had already been quashed by the Apex Court vide judgment dated 30-09-2013 passed in Civil Appeal No.6353 of 2013. It is contended that the Opposite Party was never a party to the aforesaid order either before Hon’ble High Court or before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The NOIDA officials in the end of July, 2014, communicated the said order to the Complainants, which had put a blanket ban on the construction and, owing to some misunderstanding, the NOIDA Authority asked the Opposite Party to stop construction on the Project site. The understanding of NOIDA Authority was faulty inasmuch as the land of the Opposite Party neither formed part of any Notification, which was quashed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court nor did the land form part of the subject matter of dispute before the Allahabad High Court. For this reason, the construction activities from July, 2014 had to be slowed down tremendously as the Opposite Party faced threat of violation of Stay order as well as the action by NOIDA Authority, while the Opposite Party Company tried its level best to convince the NOIDA Authority that their understanding of the matter was faulty.
10.     On 17-11-2014, the NOIDA Authority, in a communication sent to one of the allottees, reiterated its faulty stand and informed that the Plot in question was partially affected by the Supreme Court Judgment dated 05-08-2013 passed in Civil Appeal No.6353 of 2013 as well as subsequent order of the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court.  It was informed that the Plots Nos.763, 762 & 761, forming part of the Project land were also part of the quashed acquisition Notification. Subsequently, the NOIDA Authority vide public notice dated 23-06-2015, informed the general public that the Project of the Opposite Party was affected by the order of Hon’ble Supreme Court passed in Rajendra Estate Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of UP & Ors.. This action of NOIDA Authority affected the pace of work as the Opposite Party was both under the threat of action by Allahabad High Court and the NOIDA Authority and, therefore, a cautious approach with limited activities had to be adopted in construction, which ultimately lead to delay in completion of the Project.
11.     It is also contended by the Opposite Party that in view of these Force Majeure events, the Project got delayed for the period starting from July 2014 to July 2016, more particularly from June 2015 till July 2016, when the issues were put in public domain. The Opposite Party in terms of the Allotment Letter is entitled to adjustment of the said period in delivering the flat. In view of the Force Majeure events, the Opposite Party shall deliver the flats within upcoming months, in fact, part Completion Certificate of Towers A, B, C, G & H has already been obtained on 20-07-2018. It is also contended by the Opposite Party that Clause 51 of the Allotment Agreement automatically extends the total period of construction as envisaged in Clause 43 by the period during which the Force Majeure events occur. Though in terms of the Clause, the Opposite Party was entitled to extension till December 2018 without grace period, however, keeping in terms with the commitment, the Opposite Party intended to finish and handover the Project at the earliest.
12.     As part of its contentions made in the Written Version the Opposite Party submitted that the relief claimed in the Complaint cannot be entertained inasmuch as the relief seeking interest @18% is contrary to the terms of the allotment duly agreed between the parties. The delay in possession is duly envisaged by the Allotment Letter and the same entails compensation @Rs.5/- per sq. ft..  The Complaint is liable to be dismissed inasmuch as the relief claimed in the Complaint cannot be granted.
13.     The Complainants filed their Rejoinder, denied all the rival contentions advanced by the Opposite Party in their Written Version and reiterated the averments made in the Complaint.
14.     The Learned Counsel for the Complainants filed Evidence by way of Affidavit and marked the copy of the Allotment Letter as Exhibit CW-1/1, copy of the Tripartite Agreement dated 26-03-2015 as Exhibit CW-1/2, copies of email dated 20-04-2015 and letter dated 24-08-2015 as Exhibit CW-1/3, copies of proof of payment/receipt/demand letters including the relevant extract of the disbursement details of loan account, relevant extract of statement of account of Complainants as Exhibit CW-1/4, copies of advertisements promising handing over of possession of Project in 2017 as Exhibit CW-1/5, copy of email dated 01-03-2017 as Exhibit CW-1/6,  copy of reply dated 22-03-2016 as Exhibit CW-1/7, copy of email dated 14-03-2018 as Exhibit CW-1/8, copy of email dated 10-05-2018 as Exhibit CW-1/9 on their behalf. The Learned Counsel for the Opposite Party also filed Evidence by way of Affidavit and marked the copy of the order dated 30-09-2013 of the High Court of Allahabad as Mark-A, copy of reply to RTI as Mark-B, copy of public notice dated 23-06-2015 as Mark-C, copy of representation dated 21-07-2015 as Mark-D, copy of order dated 11-07-2016 of Allahabad High Court as Mark-E, copy of completion certificate of towers A, B, C, G & H as Mark-F.
15.     I have heard the parties’ counsel at length, perused the material on record as well as the Written Submissions filed by the parties’ counsel.
16.     The Learned Counsel for the Complainants vehemently contended that the Opposite Party has attempted to commit fraud by conveniently ignoring the fact that the allotment in favour of the Complainants was made by the Opposite Party on 19-03-2015, i.e, after almost nine months of its knowledge about the order of the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court directing all the parties to maintain status quo in respect of the land whereto acquisition proceedings have already been quashed by Apex Court vide judgment dated 05-08-2013 in CA No.6353 of 2013 as also by the Allahabad High Court vide its judgement dated 30-09-2013 in WP No.59931 of 2011, until further orders. This fact which is now being pleaded by the Opposite Party as an event of Force Majeure was never brought to the notice of the Complainants, nor stated in the Allotment Letter nor any shred of correspondence has been made by the Opposite Party in this regard till date. In pursuance of the demand letter dated  01-11-2018 issued by the Opposite Party demanding balance consideration of 15% alleging that the construction of the flat has been completed and it was ready for possession and that the NOIDA Authority has issued Completion Certificate dated 29-10-2018 in this regard, the Complainants inspected the flat on 05-11-2018, took various photographs which are filed on record, and found that the construction was still far from completion as the work of interior and fittings including almirah’s, false ceilings, flooring, doors, windows, sanitary ware, electrical fittings, wooden work, etc., was still not done and the flat was not even having a basic shell structure. On an application filed by the Complainants, the said demand letter was stayed by this Hon’ble Commission on 20-11-2018. It is further contended that the Complainants demanded a copy of the alleged Completion Certificate dated 29-10-2018 from the Opposite Party on 09-11-2018, but instead of providing the document, the Opposite Party threatened the Complainant No.2 to take possession failing which the allotment was to be cancelled.
17.     Placing reliance upon various judgments of the Hon’ble National Commission in DLF Homes Panchkula Pvt. Ltd. Vs. D. S. Dhanda (Manu/CF/0837/2018), Ravi Marwah Vs. Unitech Reliable Projects (Manu/CF/0159/2016), Swarn Talwar Vs. Unitech Ltd. (Manu/CF/0586/2015), Prakash Vishwanath Vs. Monarch & Qureshi Builders, CC No.1833 of 2016 decided on 22-04-2019, Navedita Dhawan Vs. Unitech Ltd. (Manu/CF/0276/2016) and that of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghvan (Manu/SC/0463/2019), the Learned Counsel for the Complainants, though they have initially made a prayer in the Complaint for possession of the booked flat with all requisite documents, has now prayed for refund of the amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/- with interest @18% p.a. from the date of respective payments till the date of actual realization thereof along with damages of Rs.50,00,000/-.
","18.     The Learned Counsel for the Opposite Party, on the other hand, has advanced rival contentions in their Written Submissions and vehemently submitted that the plot subject matter of the Project came to be affected by order dated 30-06-2014 of the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court whereby all projects in respect of the land where acquisition proceedings had been quashed by the Apex Court vide its judgment dated 30-09-2013 in CA No.6353 of 2013 were directed to maintain status quo. The NOIDA officials, owing to some misunderstanding, had asked the Opposite Party to stop construction at the Project site because the land under the Project neither formed part of any Notification which was quashed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court nor did it form part of the subject matter before Allahabad High Court. The faulty stand taken by the NOIDA Authority was reiterated by the said Authority on 17-11-2014 informing one of the allottees of the Project that the Plots Nos.763, 762 and 761 formed part of the Project land as also formed part of quashed acquisition Notifications. That general public was informed by the NOIDA Authority by issuing a public notice on 23-06-2015 in this regard. The Complainants were aware of the aforesaid developments, particularly the public notice dated 23-06-2015; however, they continued with the Project, thereby acquiescence to the Force Majeure event and ultimately delay in construction. The stay order was eventually lifted by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court on 11-07-2016 in WP (C) No.33341 of 2014. The Opposite Party is entitled to extension of time till December, 2018 due to these Force Majeure events with grace period; however, keeping in terms with commitment, the Opposite Party has offered possession on 05-11-2018 after obtaining completion certificate on 30-10-2018. The Learned Counsel further argued that the Complainant, even after being aware of the Public Notice from NOIDA Authority dated 23-06-2015 informing stay on construction, never sought to cancel the allotment or refund, but through emails dated 14-03-2018 and 10-05-2018 they sought time frame for completion of the Project and execution of Sale Deed. Thus, time was never essence of the contract, but it was extended by the Complainants by their own acts and conducts. Even in the Complaint, filed in June 2018, the Complainants did not pray refund as primary relief but merely completion of the apartment within reasonable time frame as may be decided by this Hon’ble Commission. The Opposite Party has offered possession within four months of filing of the Complaint i.e. on 01-11-2018 and the same is reasonable time considering that the Project was affected by Force Majeure from July 2014 till July 2016, more particularly May 2015 till July 2016.
19.     I have given my thoughtful consideration to the issue at hand. In brief, it is the Complainants’ case that despite paying an amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/- out of the total sale consideration of Rs.3,30,65,800/- for Flat No.E-1510 on 14th Floor, in Tower E of the Project, the Opposite Party did not complete the construction nor offered possession within the stipulated time period i.e. by December, 2016 and not even paid any amount towards delayed delivery.
20.     Admittedly, the litigation apropos land acquisition had initiated prior to entering into the transaction by the Complainants. The facts and consequences thereof were not brought to the notice of the Complainants at the time of entering into the transaction or at the time of issuance of Allotment Letter on 19-03-2015. The Complainants came to know only when a public notice was issued by the NOIDA Authority on 23-06-2015. I may make it explicit that having induced the Complainants to enter into a transaction, being fully aware of the consequences relating to availability of land or quashing of notification of acquisition of land and the communications made pursuant thereto by the NOIDA Authority, the efforts of the Opposite Party to take shelter of these well predictable consequences as Force Majeure events did not in any manner dilute the Opposite Party’s responsibilities towards the project planning, execution and completion, including availability of land (acquisition of land) and approvals at the due time, without cost or time overruns and which responsibilities arose on the date of entering into the transaction with the Complainants and receiving the first payment towards the total cost of the subject flat from the Complainants. It is, therefore, clear that if the event of the stay order dated 30-06-2014 was such an important event, to constitute it as an event of Force Majeure, including subsequent correspondence of the Noida authority on the subject, if the assertion pleaded by the Opposite Party is to be taken on its face value, and the Opposite Party actually believed that on account of such events, there is likelihood of delay in construction project, it still went ahead and suggested the date of December, 2016 for handing over of project, to lure the Complainants into purchasing the flat in question, which date the Opposite Party was fully aware as not a possible date for handing over the possession. It is, thus, clear that the Opposite Party had played unfair and deceptive practices upon the Complainants by deliberately and actively concealing the facts in the Allotment Letter or any other correspondence on the subject, and induced the Complainants to enter into the contract.
21.     The Opposite Party has not clarified anywhere about the location of the three Khasra numbers, being Khasra number 761, 762 and 763, which were allegedly wrongly construed by the NOIDA Authority as falling under the stay order granted by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court. The Opposite Party has failed to point out a single correspondence or any order passed by any Government authority, including the NOIDA authority, whereby the Opposite Party was asked to stop construction activity. The Opposite Party, on its own, has set up a case that the lands forming part of the Project were never part of the acquisition proceedings, which were under challenge before the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court or the Hon’ble Supreme Court and whose acquisition were quashed. Even in respect of Khasra number 761, 762 and 763, the stand of Opposite Party is very clear that the concerned lands never formed part of the land acquisition proceedings, which were quashed. This is also reflected in the representation dated 21-07-2015 allegedly sent by the Opposite Party to the NOIDA Authority. A perusal of the said representation would reveal that nowhere in the entire representation, it has been pleaded that the construction activity is lying stopped on account of fault of the NOIDA Authority. As such, it is clear that the construction activity was never stopped, and the defence has only been raised to avoid the payment of compensation.
22.     It is amply clear from the material on record as well as the own admission of the Opposite Party in its Written Version that the Opposite Party deliberately kept the Complainants in dark by not making them aware about the Stay order dated 30-06-2014 passed by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court, which was allegedly wrongly construed by the NOIDA Authority as being granted against some portion of the land (Khasra No. 761, 762 and 763) belonging to Opposite Party. The NOIDA Authority had communicated the said order in July, 2014 and November 17, 2014 to the Opposite Party and the Opposite Party was fully aware that the construction work at the Project site would be affected by the said order. However, the Opposite Party without bringing to the notice of the Complainants the consequences relating to availability of land or quashing of notification of acquisition of land and the communications made pursuant thereto by the NOIDA Authority, lured the Complainants to enter into the transaction with the Opposite Party and, subsequently, made allotment in favour of the Complainants on 19-03-2015, almost after nine months of its knowledge about the stand of NOIDA Authority. In the absence of the facts and the consequences thereof being specifically and explicitly brought to their notice, the buyers would reasonably and correctly understand that all aspects of project planning, execution and completion, inclusive of availability of land (acquisition of land) and approvals from concerned authorities at the due time, are the responsibility of the builder and would be duly taken care of by the builder without cost or time overruns.
23.     In my considered view, not bringing the material facts and consequences relating to availability of land (acquisition of land) and approvals from the concerned authorities at the due time to the notice of the Complainants while entering into a transaction with the Complainants are unfair and deceptive practices on the part of the Opposite Party within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
24.     Be that as it may, though the Opposite Party is still ready and willing to hand over the possession of the allotted flat to the Complainants, a valuable right has arisen in favour of the Complainants by efflux of time and due to failure of the Opposite Party to give possession for about three years from the stipulated date of possession, to take possession of the subject flat at this belated stage or to seek refund of the entire amount deposited with reasonable compensation. In Emmar MGF Land Ltd. & Ors. vs. Amit Puri - II (2015) CPJ 568 NC,  this Commission has held that after the promised date of delivery, it is the discretion of the Complainant whether he wants to accept the offer of possession, if any, or seek refund of the amounts paid with reasonable interest. I am of the view that the Complainants cannot be made to wait indefinitely for the delivery of the possession when they had already paid almost the entire consideration. In such circumstances, it is well within the Complainant’s right to seek for refund of the principal amount with interest and compensation.
25.     The Learned Counsel for the Complainants has submitted that the Complainants are not interested to take possession of the subject flat due to delay of about three years in delivering the possession. Therefore, they have sought the refund of the amount paid along with interest and compensation.
26.     The last contention argued by the Learned Counsel for the Opposite Party is that the relief sought for refund with interest @18% p.a. is contrary to the terms of the Allotment Letter and is in a way of re-writing the terms of the allotment which is not permissible, more so, when the Complainant neither disputed the terms of allotment nor challenged them in any of the reliefs. It is also submitted by the Learned Counsel that the Opposite Party has contributed an amount of Rs.36,32,297/- towards the EMIs for 24 months out of the entire sale consideration paid i.e. Rs.2,96,89,370/- and the Complainants cannot enrich themselves by claiming interest on the total amount of Rs.2,96,89,370/-.
27.     The aforesaid contention, in my view, does not really arise for consideration in this case. The primary purpose of a Consumer in booking a residential Flat which the Builder is to construct for him, is to start living in that house on or about the date committed to him by the Builder for delivering possession of the Flat booked by him. If the Builder fails to comply with the contractual obligation and at the same time, is unable to show that the delay in completion of the Flat and offering its possession to the Consumer is on account of circumstances beyond his control, this would constitute deficiency on the part of the Builder/Service Provider in rendering services to the Consumer. If I accept the contention that the Builder can indefinitely postpone and delay the construction of the Flat and the Flat Buyer has no option but to wait till the Builder decides to complete the construction and offer possession to the Buyer, that would be nothing but a travesty of justice and result in a situation where the Flat Buyer is left at the mercy of the Builder, without recourse to an appropriate legal remedy. Such an interpretation, if taken, is bound to defeat the very objective behind the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act, as far as housing construction is concerned. Therefore, I am unable to accept the contention advanced by the learned Counsel for the Opposite Party. In my view, wherever the Builder commits a particular date or time frame for completion of the construction and offering possession to the Buyer, they must necessarily honour the commitment made by them, though a minor delay may not constitute deficiency in the service rendered by them to the Buyer. Of course, if the Builder is able to show that the delay in completion of the construction and offering possession to the Buyer is attributable wholly to the circumstances beyond its control, that may not be a case of deficiency in the services rendered to the Consumer.
28.     At this juncture, I find it a fit case to place reliance on the recent judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghavan - II (2009) CPJ 34 (SC), wherein the Apex Court has observed as follows:
“6.7.   A terms of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat purchasers had no option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the builder. The contractual terms of the Agreement dated 08.05.2012 are ex-facie one sided, unfair and unreasonable. The incorporation of such one-sided clauses in an agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of selling the flats by the Builder.
7.       In view of the above discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the terms of the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement dated 08.05.2012 were wholly one-sided and unfair to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser. The Appellant-Builder cannot seek to bind the Respondent with such one-sided contractual terms.”
29.     I further place reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Devasis Rudra - II (2019) CPJ 29 SC,  in which the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed as hereunder:-
“.....It would be manifestly unreasonable to construe the contract between the parties as requiring the buyer to wait indefinitely for possession. By 2016, nearly seven years had elapsed from the date of the agreement. Even according to the developer, the completion certificate was received on 29 March 2016. This was nearly seven years after the extended date for the handing over of possession prescribed by the agreement. A buyer can be expected to wait for possession for a reasonable period. A period of seven years in beyond what is reasonable. Hence, it would have been manifestly unfair to non-suit the buyer merely on the basis of the first prayer in the reliefs sought before the SCDRC. There was in any event a prayer for refund.
In the circumstances, we are of the view that the orders passed by the SCDRC and by the NCDRC for refund of moneys were justified.”
30.     In the instant case also the Complainants cannot be made to wait indefinitely as the possession of the flat has not been handed over to them so far and the Opposite Party is enjoying the benefits of their hard-earning money deposited with it. Therefore, the Complainants are also entitled for refund of the principal amount with reasonable interest and compensation.
31.    Even though in the main relief, the Complainants have sought for possession of the Flats/Apartments in these Complaints and alternatively they have claimed refund of the amount deposited by them along with interest and compensation, but as the Builder Opposite Party has failed to deliver the possession of the Flats to the Complainants latest by 31-12-2016, i.e. the stipulated period with grace period in the Agreement and approximately 3 years have passed but the possession has not been given and the Complainants cannot be made to wait for such a long period, they are entitled for refund of the deposited amount along with compensation. Hence, for all the afore-noted reasons, the Complaint is partly allowed and disposed of along with pending IAs, if any, with the following directions:
(i)      the Opposite Party shall refund the entire amount deposited by the Complainants along with interest @ 12% p.a. from the respective dates of deposits till the date of realisation, within a period of one month from today failing which the Opposite Party shall be liable to pay interest @ 14% p.a.. The interest @ 12% p.a. has been directed to be paid for the reason that the Complainants have taken home loans from the Banks/Financial Institutions for making payment to the Builder/Opposite Party for purchasing the Flats/Apartments in question;
(ii)     the Opposite Party shall also pay Rs.10,000/- as costs of litigation to the Complainants.
32.     Before parting, I may make it clear that the interest @12% p.a. on the refund of the amount which has been awarded as compensation is not factually interest on refund and, therefore, there is no question of deducting any tax on source.

","JUDGEMENT
JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
No one is present for the respondent Insurer when the matter is called. Though an Advocate had appeared on the last date of hearing, no one is present today on its behalf and no Vakalatnama in favour of any Advocate has been filed. I have therefore, heard the learned counsel for the complainant/petitioner.
2.      The complainant/petitioner owned a vehicle which he had got insured with the respondent for the period from 7.11.2008 to 6.11.2009. The said vehicle was stolen in the night intervening 24th -25th June, 2009 from District Dhausa of Rajasthan. An FIR was lodged by the petitioner/complainant initially with Police Station Jhansi which was later transferred to Dhausa Police Station Maanpur in District Dhausa of Rajasthan. The claim was however, rejected by the insurer vide letter dated 24.6.2020 which to the extent it is legible in the copy filed by the petitioner reads as under:-
“…….to your claim intimation dated 03/10/09 that your vehicle was stolen on 24/06/09, hence a . …….After scrutinizing documents submitted by we regret to inform you that we are unable to admit any liability under this claim as per Policy terms & Conditions. As per our policy condition no ""Notice shall be given in writing to the company immediately upon the occurrence of any accident or loss or damage and in the event of any claim and thereafter the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the company shall require.""
Hence we regret to inform you that the claim is not payable due to violation of our policy terms & condition, hence our aforesaid claim stands repudiated. This is without Prejudice to right to repudiated our liability on any specific ground grounds which are available to us for the time being or which may be available to us in future. Which please kindly be noted.
3.      Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim, the petitioner/complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.
4.      The complaint was resisted by the insurer primarily on the ground on which the claim had been repudiated, the said ground being delayed intimation of the theft to the insurer.
5.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the respondent approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order dated 1.11.2017, the State Commission allowed the appeal and consequently dismissed the complaint. Being aggrieved, the petitioner/complainant is before this Commission by way of this revision petition.
6.      It would be seen from a perusal of the repudiation letter that delayed intimation of the theft to the insurer was the sole ground of repudiation of the claim. As far as the FIR with the Police Station is concerned, there was no objectionable delay, the FIR having allegedly been lodged on 27.6.2009, after a gap of one day delay from the theft of the vehicle. The report of the surveyor would show that the FIR was lodged on 27.6.2009 and 1.10.2009 meaning thereby that the FIR for the first time came to be lodged on 27.6.2009. The survey report shows that according to the complainant, he had left for outstation with his family after asking his driver to park the vehicle in the garage. When he returned and asked the driver to bring the vehicle, the driver did not find the vehicle in the garage and therefore, the FIR was lodged at Jhansi on 27.6.2009.
","7.      Though there has been delay in intimating the loss to the insurer, the said delay becomes inconsequential when the FIR was promptly lodged as far as the complainant came to know of the theft of the vehicle and as noted by the Fora below, a final report has already been submitted by the concerned police station which could not trace the vehicle. This issue recently came for consideration of a three-Members Bench of this Commission in a Three-Members Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Gurshinder Singh Vs. Shriram General Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. Civil Appeal No.653 of 2020 decided on 24.01.2020, where the Hon’ble Apex Court had an occasion to examine the consequences of the delay in intimating the theft of a vehicle to the insurer.  In the case before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, a tractor came to be stolen on 28.10.2010.  Though an FIR with the concerned Police Station was promptly lodged, the intimation to the insurer was given after 52 days.  The insurer having rejected the claim on account of delay in intimating the theft to them, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint.  The complaint was allowed by the District Forum and the appeal against its order was dismissed by the State Commission.  However, this Commission allowed the Revision Petition preferred by the insurer and dismissed the Consumer Complaint.  Being aggrieved, the complainant approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of an appeal.  Noticing the conflict between its two earlier decisions, Om Prakash Vs. Reliance General Insurance & Anr. and Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Parvesh Chander Chadha, a Two-Judges Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court referred the matter to the larger Bench.  Answering the reference the larger Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia held as under:
15. We find, that the second part of Condition No. 1 deals with the ‘theft or criminal act other than the accident’. It provides, that in case of theft or criminal act which may be the subject of a claim under the policy, the insured shall give immediate notice to the police and co­operate with the company in securing the conviction of the offender. The object behind giving immediate notice to the police appears to be that if the police is immediately informed about the theft or any criminal act, the police machinery can be set in motion and steps for recovery of the vehicle could be expedited. In a case of theft, the insurance company or a surveyor would have a limited role. It is the police, who acting on the FIR of the insured, will be required to take immediate steps for tracing
and recovering the vehicle. Per contra, the surveyor of the insurance company, at the most, could ascertain the factum regarding the theft of the vehicle.
16. It is further to be noted that, in the event, after the registration of an FIR, the police successfully recovering the vehicle and returning the same to the insured, there would be no occasion to lodge a claim for compensation on account of the policy. It is only when the police are not in a position to trace and recover the vehicle and the final report is lodged by the police after the vehicle is not traced, the insured would be in a position to lodge his claim for compensation. As observed by the bench of two learned Judges in the case of Om Prakash (supra), after the vehicle is stolen, a person, who lost his vehicle, would immediately lodge an FIR and the immediate conduct that would be expected of such
a person would be to assist the police in search of the vehicle. The registration of the FIR regarding the theft of the vehicle and the final report of the police after the vehicle is not traced would substantiate the claim of the claimant that the vehicle is stolen. Not only that, but the surveyors appointed by the insurance company are also required to enquire whether the claim of the claimant regarding the theft is genuine or not. If the surveyor appointed by the insurance company, upon inquiry, finds that the claim of theft is genuine then coupled with the immediate registration of the FIR, in our view, would be conclusive proof of the vehicle being stolen.
18. We concur with the view taken in the case of Om Prakash (supra), that in such a situation if the claimant is denied the claim merely on the ground that there is some delay in intimating the insurance company about the occurrence of the theft, it would be taking a hyper technical view. We find, that this Court in Om Prakash (supra) has rightly held that it would not be fair and reasonable to reject genuine claims which had already been verified and found to be correct by the investigator.
19. We find, that this Court in Om Prakash (supra) has rightly held that the Consumer Protection Act aims at protecting the interest of the consumers and it being a beneficial legislation deserves pragmatic construction. We find, that in Om Prakash (supra) this Court has rightly held that mere delay in intimating the insurance company about the theft of the vehicle should not be a shelter to repudiate the insurance claim which has been otherwise proved to be genuine.
20. We, therefore, hold that when an insured has lodged the FIR immediately after the theft of a vehicle occurred and when the police after investigation have lodged a final report after the vehicle was not traced and when the surveyors/investigators appointed by the insurance company have found the claim of the theft to be genuine, then mere delay in intimating the insurance company about the occurrence of the theft cannot be a ground to deny the claim of the insured.
8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, I hold that the in the facts and circumstances of the case, the insurer was not justified in repudiation of the claim on the sole ground of delayed intimation to the insurer. The impugned order is, therefore, set aside and the insurer is directed to settle the claim on merits within six weeks from today. The complainant shall also be entitled to interest on the amount found payable to him in terms of the insurance policy @ 9% p.a. w.e.f. six months from the lodgement of the claim till the date of payment.
Later on, Ms. Shantha Devi Raman & Ms. Aishna Jain, Advocates for the respondent have appeared who have been apprised about the order.

4.      The insured died on 06.10.2010. Her son Narender Kumar, the petitioner filed insurance claim for all the policies with necessary claim papers. It was alleged that OPs repudiated the claim without any sufficient reason. Being aggrieved, the complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum, Narnaul.
5.      The opposite party LIC in its written statement submitted that at the time of obtaining insurance policies the insured had concealed a material fact. She was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and underwent Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR ) surgery in 2003.
6.      The District Forum, after hearing the parties, allowed the complaint.
7.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 separate appeals before the State Commission.
","8.      The State Commission allowed all the appeals with a common Order dated 12.04.2016 because the question of facts and law involved was identical and consequently dismissed all the complaints.
9.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 revision petitions before this Commission under section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
10.    Heard the learned counsel for both sides. Perused the entire material on record.
11.    The State Commission clearly observed in paras 10, 16 and 21 of its Order dated 12.04.2016 that the insured suppressed the material facts while filling the proposal form. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as below:
10.  LIC also sought the opinion of Dr. R.R. Kasiwal. It has been certified by Dr. Kasliwal vide Exhibit R – 7 that earlier the patient (insured ) was admitted in the hospital on September 22nd, 2010 and was discharged on 27th 2010. In column No. 4, the nature of ailment has been mentioned “breathlessness, RHD, Post MVR (2003) Severe TR”. From these two documents (Exhibit R- 6 & R-7), it is clear that the insured was a patient of Rheumatic Heart Disease and Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) was performed in 2003.
­- - - -
16.     On the aforesaid facts and principle enunciated, the right to claim insurance benefits by the complainants does not survive in view of the medical record, that is, Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R. Kasliwal. Thus, it stands established to the hilt that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the Insurance Policies and she suppressed this fact in her statements (proposal forms) made at the time of purchasing the insurance policies.
- - - -
21. In the case in hand, LIC has proved by leading cogent evidence consisting of Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R Kasliwal, Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the insurance policies. So, the authorities referred to above are no help to the complainants.
- - -
12.    Thus it is apparent that the insured was a known case of RHD and underwent MVR surgery before obtaining the policy. She had not disclosed the information about her treatment in the proposal form at column no. 11. Thus it was a material suppression of facts which is not acceptable in a contract of insurance, which is a contract in good faith, uberrima fides.
13.    Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Commission have held in several cases about the concealment of material information. In the case of Modern Insulators Ltd. Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2000) 2 SCC 734, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
It is the fundamental principle of insurance law that utmost good faith must be observed by the contracting parties and the good faith forbids either party from non-disclosure of the facts which the parties know. ………
14.    We have perused the written version filed by the LIC of India before the District Forum. It is pertinent to note that in its written version, the stand taken by the LIC of India (OP) was as below:
The opp. Parties are not liable for making any payment to the complainant under the above said policies. Therefore keeping in the view the above said facts the complainant is not entitled to get any relief. The decision dated 01.08.2011 passed by the Sr. Divisional Manager is according to law and facts and is in favour of principle of natural justice and falls within definition of self speaking decision, hence the claim of the complainant was rightly repudiated by the competent authority as per terms and conditions of the policy and admitted the liability to refund the 90% of first premium paid under the policy. The complainant has concealed the real material facts before the Hon’ble consumer forum and misleading the Hon’ble forum by presenting wrong facts. Hence the complainant is not entitled to any relief as claimed in the complaint.
(emphasis supplied)
15.    We find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned and needs more interference and the same is affirmed.  There is no merit in the revision petitions and the same are dismissed.
16.    In reference to paragraph no. 14, we note that the deceased insured had paid certain amount(s) towards first premium(s) in every policy. Therefore, the LIC of India shall refund 90% of the first premium amount in respect of each policy paid by the insured as admitted by the LIC of India in its written statement. The refund may be ensured within four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this Order, else it will carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment.
With this direction all the revision petitions are disposed of.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
17.    Heard the Petitioner in person and the learned Counsel for the Respondent. Perused the material on record.
18.    In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Petitioner, to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing these 09 Revision Petitions is condoned.
19.    The short point in this matter is that one Smt. Laxmi Devi, the insured, the mother of one Mr. Narendra Kumar Jain, the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, had purchased 09 life insurance policies from the LIC, the Opposite Party, the Respondent herein, in which the Complainant was the nominee.
The dates of commencement of the policies were 28.12.2008 (04 policies) and 01.01.2009 (05 policies).
The insured expired on 06.10.2010, i.e. within two years of commencement of the policies.
The LIC repudiated the claim on the ground that the insured was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and had undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, this fact was not disclosed in the proposal form / personal statement, the insured made deliberate incorrect statements and withheld correct information regarding her health. As such the LIC repudiated the said 09 claims, but admitted to its liability to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions.
As evident from its written version, the LIC took the same stand before the District Forum, that the claims were repudiated for deliberate incorrect statements and withholding correct information regarding her health by the insured but 90% of the first premium paid in each policy would be refunded as per the policy conditions.
20.    The District Forum had allowed the Complaints.
The State Commission, in appeal, has dismissed the Complaints, inter alia observing that “12.  In the proposal forms, the insured stated that her usual state of health was good and she never suffered from any heart disease, liver, stomach etc. Thus, from the evidence available on record, it is established that insured had concealed the material fact with regard to her health.”.
21.    An insurance contract has to be in utmost good faith, by both sides. And in a life insurance contract, existence of pre-existing disease / health condition is a material question, necessarily required to be answered truthfully.
22.    In the instant matter, the insured, while taking multiple (09) life insurance policies, suppressed the (pre-) existence of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and of having undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, which were material facts.
The appraisal made by the State Commission conclusively determines willful and intentional suppression of material facts.
And there is no mitigating factor. It is reasonable and appropriate to say that
the insured knew what she was signing, she knew the significance of the
information being supplied by her.
23.    The State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
24.    It goes without saying that the LIC would be duty-bound to comply with its affirmation to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions. If the said refund has not already made in respect of each policy, it shall be made within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order, failing which the said amount(s) shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment(s).
25.    Disposed.

  For the Appellant     :Mr. Suresh Kr. Tiwari, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. B.K. Berera, Advocate 
","ORDER
1.      This Appeal has been filed under Section 19 of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 13.08.2014 in C.C. No. 199 of 2013 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U.P., hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’.
2.      The Appellant herein, who was the Complainant before the State Commission, is hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Jal Nigam’.
The Respondents herein, who were the Opposite Parties before the State Commission, are hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Postal Department’.
3.      Heard the learned Counsel for the Jal Nigam and the Postal Department, and perused the material on record.
4.      This Appeal has been filed with delay of 54 days.
5.      In the interest of justice, and considering the reasons stated in the application for condonation of delay, and to settle the matter on merit, the delay is condoned.
6.      The Complaint Case No. 199 of 2013 was dismissed on limitation by the State Commission vide its impugned Order dated 13.08.2014.
7.      The matter, briefly, is that as per a Notification dated 08.03.1995 of Ministry of Finance, Government of India, hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Notification’, which came into force with effect from 01.04.1995, Kisan Vikas Patras, hereinafter being referred to as the ‘KVPs’, could not be purchased by Corporations / Organizations.
The Jal Nigam, a State Government Corporation / Organisation, purchased KVPs from the Postal Department on 19.04.2000 and 31.05.2000.
The maturity value of the KVPs was not paid by the Postal Department to the Jal Nigam on the dates of maturity i.e. on 19.04.2006 and on 31.05.2006.
The principal amount deposited with the Postal Department was not refunded by the Postal Department on the dates of maturity i.e. on 19.04.2006 and 31.05.2006.
Interest as admissible under the KVPs on the dates of maturity i.e. on 19.04.2006 and 31.05.2006 was not paid.
The principal amount deposited with the Postal Department was refunded by the Postal Department to the Jal Nigam on 10.04.2010.
Interest as just and equitable (albeit lower than that admissible on the KVPs), from the dates of deposit i.e. from 19.04.2000 and 31.05.2000, or from the dates of maturity i.e. from 19.04.2006 and 31.05.2006, was not paid.
8.      From the arguments made by the learned Counsel for the two sides, it evinces that the following questions are inter alia germane in the matter:
[a]     If, in violation of the Notification, KVPs were purchased by Jal Nigam, i.e. an ineligible Corporation / Organisation, from the Postal Department, was the Jal Nigam, which purchased the KVPs, responsible for making deposits contrary to the Notification / rules, or was the Postal Department, which administered the KVPs, responsible for accepting deposits contrary to the Notification / rules, or were both responsible.
[b]     It being nobody’s case that the principal amount deposited was not to be refunded, would the delay in refund (made on 10.04.2010) attract just and equitable interest (albeit lower than that admissible on the KVPs), and, if so, whether the said interest would be from the dates of (irregular) deposit i.e. from 19.04.2000 and 31.05.2000, or from the dates of maturity i.e. from 19.04.2006 and 31.05.2006.
9.      Section 24A of the Act, which deals with ‘Limitation period’, prescribes a period of two years from the date on which the cause of action arose.
However, it also provides that a Complaint may be entertained if sufficient cause for not filing the Complaint within the said period of two years is shown to the satisfaction of the Consumer Protection Forum concerned, and allows for condoning the delay for reasons recorded.
10.    The Complaint before the State Commission was filed by the Jal Nigam on 24.12.2013.
It is noted that multiple litigation in respect of different sets of KVPs was going on between the Jal Nigam and the Postal Department.
It is also noted that it is nobody’s case that refund of the principal amount was not to be made.
It is further noted that, in the case at hand, the principal amount was deposited on 19.04.2000 and 31.05.2000. The KVPs matured on 19.04.2006 and 31.05.2006. The refund of the principal amount was made on 10.04.2010. Hence, even from the point of view of the Postal Department, till 10.04.2010 it was a continuing wrong, a continuing cause of action.
A perusal of the State Commission’s impugned Order shows that the Jal Nigam, a Government Corporation / Organisation, took some time in completing the procedural requirements of competent approval for agitating the matter and for getting a government advocate assigned, which were completed on 11.11.2013. It further shows that the Jal Nigam filed an application under the RTI Act of 2005 to obtain information from the Postal Department, which was replied to by the Postal Department on 20.10.2013, and whereby the Postal Department declined to provide the information asked for. A legal notice was sent by the Jal Nigam to the Postal Department on 01.10.2013, which was not replied to by the Postal Department for about two months.
As such, in the totality of the facts and situation enunciated above, sufficient cause to condone the delay in filing the instant Complaint on 24.12.2013 is adequately forthcoming.
11.    However, notwithstanding the afore, and independent and separate thereof, having regard to the facts and specificities of the case, and to the questions germane in the matter (refer para 8 above also), it is just and appropriate that the Complaint before the forum of original jurisdiction, the State Commission, be comprehensively and holistically examined on merit, on facts and law, with the affording of the due opportunity to both sides, and the delay be condoned.
12.    With this brief examination, the delay in filing the instant Complaint before the State Commission is condoned.
The impugned Order dated 13.08.2014 of the State Commission is set aside.
The State Commission is requested to adjudicate the C.C. No. 199 of 2013 on its merit as per the law.
13.    This Commission has consciously refrained from entering into the merits of the matter, or making any critique of the facts and specificities of the matter, or recording any observations or comments on the questions germane in the matter, since the case has as yet to be adjudicated on merit by the forum of original jurisdiction, the State Commission, and this Commission does not in any manner want to colour the vision of the State Commission.
14.    Both sides are directed to appear before the State Commission on 03.02.2020.
15.    The Registry is directed to send a copy each of this Order to both sides and to the State Commission within three days of its pronouncement.
","15.    The Registry is directed to send a copy each of this Order to both sides and to the State Commission within three days of its pronouncement.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, MEMBER
","1.      These Revision Petitions have been filed against a common Order dated 30.04.2013 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in First Appeal No. 130, 109 & 126 of 2007, whereby FA/109/2007 was partly accepted and the Order of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Bathinda (hereinafter referred to as the “District Forum”) was modified, and FA/126/2007 & FA/130/2007 were dismissed and the order of the District Forum was affirmed.
2.      For convenience, the Parties are placed in their respective position as stated in the original Consumer Complaint before the District Forum.
3.      Brief facts are that, the Complainant’s wife, Smt. Sukhpal Kaur, (hereinafter referred to as the ‘patient’) on 07.09.2005 underwent hysterectomy by Dr. Sanjay Garg, (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 1) in Delhi Nursing Home, Bathinda. After surgery she was made ambulatory (to walk within 12 hours of surgery) and oral feeds within 24 hours, the urinary catheter was put for 48 hours of surgery. She was discharged on 10.09.2005 in satisfactory condition. However, on the next day due to swelling and numbness in her left leg, she was taken to Opposite Party No. 1 in emergency. Her condition further deteriorated and she was taken to M/s Delhi Heart Institute and Research Centre, Bathinda (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 2), wherein she was diagnosed as post-hysterectomy DVT with anemia and septicemia. After short treatment, she was referred to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana (hereinafter referred to as the “DMC”) (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 3). There she was diagnosed as post hysterectomy DVT with septicemic shock with DIC and MOF. The doctors therein informed that the condition of patient was due to the negligence of the Opposite Party No. 1. The patient died in DMC on 12.09.2005. The Complainant alleged that the operation was performed negligently by the Opposite Party No. 1 and no post-operative tests were conducted to rule out complications such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and septicemia. Being aggrieved a Consumer Complaint before the District Forum, Bathinda was filed by the husband of the deceased.
4.      The Opposite Parties filed their written versions and denied allegations of negligence. The preliminary objection on maintainability of the Complaint was raised as the Complainant had no locus standi. The Complaint was frivolous and filed with intention to blackmail the Opposite Parties. The Opposite Party No. 1 contended that the surgery was successfully conducted with due care as per the standard method and the recovery was good. All required precautions were taken during operation and post-operatively. There is no nexus between DVT and the hysterectomy. The Opposite Party No. 1 admitted that the patient was brought again on 11.09.2005 and DVT was diagnosed. After initial treatment for DVT, the patient was referred to the Opposite Party No. 2 wherein she was treated for short period and referred to DMC, Ludhiana (the Opposite Party No. 3) for further management. Subsequently, the patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on 12.09.2005. The Opposite Parties Nos. 4 & 5 also filed their respective written versions and denied medical negligence.
5.      After the appraisal of the evidence on record, the District Forum vide order dated 12.12.2006, partly allowed the Complaint against the Opposite Parties Nos. 1, 3 & 4 and passed the following Order:
35.       In the result, complaint against Opposite Party No. 1, 3 & 4 is accepted with cost of Rs.1,000/- to be shared by them equally. Complaint against Opposite Parties No.2 & 5 stands dismissed. Directions to Opposite Parties No. 1, 3 & 4 are given as under:
(i)        Opposite Parties No. 1 & 4 to pay Rs.2,35,000/- to the complainant i.e. Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation on account of death of Mrs. Sukhpal Kaur, Rs.20,000/- as compensation for cost of treatment incurred by him at the hospitals and Rs.15,000/- under Section 14(1)(d) of the Act. Their liability is joint as well as several.
(ii)       Opposite Party No. 3 to pay Rs.15,000/- to the complainant as compensation under Section 14 (1)(d) of the Act.
Compliance of this order be made within 30 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order failing which the amount of compensation under Section 14(1)(d) of the Act would carry interest @ 9% p.a. till payment.
6.      Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Opposite Party No. 1 and the Opposite Party No. 4 filed FA/130/2007 and the Opposite Party No. 3 filed FA/126/2007 before the State Commission, Punjab for dismissal of the Complaint, whereas, for enhancement of compensation, the Complainant Harjit Singh filed FA/109/2007.
7.      The State Commission dismissed the FA/126/2007 and FA/130/2007. The State Commission partly accepted the FA/109/2007 and enhanced the total award to Rs. 4,35,000/- to be paid to the Complainant.  Further in FA/126/2007, the Opposite Party No. 3 was directed to remit the amount of Rs. 7,667/- to the Complainant along with interest.
8.      Being aggrieved, New India Assurance Co. (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 4) and Dr. Sanjay Garg (the Opposite Party No. 1) have filed these Revision Petitions.
9.      We have heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners as well as the Complainant and perused the material on record inter alia treatment records from all three hospitals where the patient was treated.
10.    We note the Complainant in para 7 of the Complaint stated that “on 11.09.2005, in the early morning, patient’s left leg got swollen and became numb. He immediately took her to the Opposite Party No. 1 at Delhi Nursing Home and got her admitted at 7.00 am. The Opposite Party No. 1 Dr. Sanjay Garg attended her, conducted some tests and examinations, and administered some medicines, but failed to control her affliction and consequently her condition got worsened. Thereafter, the Opposite Party No. 1 referred the patient to Delhi Heart Institute (Opposite Party No. 2) for further treatment. In our view, the Opposite Party No. 1 promptly attended to the  complications and made proper referral  to the higher center. In the instant case we do not find any deriliction in duty of care by the treating doctor. In Delhi Heart Institute (the Opposite Party No. 2) Pulmonary Embolism was suspected with anuria and septicemia. The initial treatment, given was Ecosprin, Clopigerel, injection Heparin and Dopamine. Thereafter, for further treatment patient was referred to Cardiology Department at Dayanand Medical College (the Opposite Party No. 3). She subsequently, developed DIC and septicemic shock with multi organ failure. The patient died on 12.09.2005 due to sudden cardiac arrest.
11.    It is relevant to know about DVT and Pulmonary Embolism from the standard medical textbooks (Harrison’s Internal Medicine) and the medical literature on the subject, wherein it has been observed as under:-
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition that happens when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVT can occur when sitting or lying down for long periods of time, such as during recovery from Surgery or during a long airplane flight. The Pulmonary Embolism (PE)happens if the clot breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to the lungs. The clot can block a blood vessel leads to low oxygen levels in blood. That it can damage the lung and other organs and cause heart failure too. Depending on the symptoms the patient was treated with thrombolytic drugs. Once the diagnosis of DVT or PE made, the goal is to shrink the clot and prevent other clots from forming. An anticoagulant is a type of blood thinner that slows blood clotting. Two types of anticoagulants are Warfarin and Heparin. The doctor may give thrombolytics to break up the clot very quickly. Such type of medication be given in a hospital, often in an emergency room.
Prophylactic measure is increasing the amount of ambulatory movement for postoperative patients. Walking increases the amount of blood flow in patients, leading to a decreased probability of blood clot formation. Additionally, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) can be used for patients who are wheelchair or bed-bound. Due to a relative lack of mobility and dehydration, DVT and PE may occur among people traveling on long airplane flights.
12.    We note that post operatively to avoid infection, the Opposite Party No. 1 administered higher antibiotics viz. Augmentin, Amikacin and pain killers. Patient was also advised for early ambulation. However, the State Commission did not consider these aspects. During postopreative period  the patient was afebrile, taking oral feeds, passing the stools. On 10.09.2006 the patient was discharged in stable condition. The Pulmonary Embolism is very fatal condition developed in the instant patient and it caused multiorgan failure (MOF) and subsequently death. However, in our view, septicemia appears to be a provisional diagnosis made by the Opposite Parties Nos. 2 and 3.
13.    The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa and others versus State of Maharashtra and others (1996) 2 SCC 634, case held that  doctor is not liable for negligence if he performs his duty with reasonableness and with due care. It held that;
“The skill of medical practitioners differs from doctor to doctor. The very nature of the profession is such that there may be more than one course of treatment which may be advisable for treating a patient. Courts would indeed be slow in attributing negligence on the part of a doctor if he has performed his duties to the best of his ability and with due care and caution. Medical opinion may differ with regard to the course of action to be taken by a doctor treating a patient, but as long as a doctor acts in a manner which is acceptable to the medical profession, and the Court finds that he has attended on the patient with due care skill and diligence and if the patient still does not survive or suffers a permanent ailment, it would be difficult to hold the doctor to be guilty of negligence.”
14.    Based on the foregoing discussion, in the given facts and the entire material on record before us, it is not feasible to attribute negligence on the  opposite parties. We set aside the Order of the State Commission and allow these Revision Petitions and dismiss the Complaint.

1.       The present Appeal is filed by the Appellant under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No. 71/2019 dated 26.12.2019.
2.       The Complainant’s husband was admitted in the hospital/Respondent No.2 on 18.10.2014 and was discharged on 28.12.2014. Later on 16.12.2014 he died and hence the Complaint was filed alleging medical negligence in the State Commission, Odisha on 16.05.2016 within the period of limitation. This Complaint was dismissed by the State Commission, Odisha for want of territorial jurisdiction, vide order dated 31.08.2018. Thereafter Respondent No.1/Complainant filed a Consumer Complaint CC/71/2019 before the State Commission West Bengal with the prayer to condone the delay of 120 days from the date of the order of the State Commission, Odisha. The main ground taken by the Complainant was that the time taken by the Court where the case was filed without jurisdiction be excluded from the period of limitation. This was contested by the Opposite Parties before the State Commission, as also the inclusion of the Appellant/Opposite Party No.3 who was not included in the Complaint filed before the State Commission, Odisha. State Commission, West Bengal considered the application for condonation of delay in filing the complaint case and allowed the same and admitted the Complaint case for disposal on merits. The State Commission also observed that when a Complainant seeks to rectify the defect in the complaint by impleading any person as a party, such a right cannot be denied.
3.       Heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellant and have also carefully gone through the record.
4.       It was submitted by the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Opposite Party No.3 that the State Commission erred in condoning the delay as it had ignored the vital fact that there was delay of 1563 days and not 120 days. It was further submitted that the State Commission had not taken into consideration the fact that the Appellant was not made a party in Complaint case CC/20/2016 filed before the State Commission, Odisha, while his name was included in the complaint case CC/71/2019 filed before the State Commission, West Bengal, which is not permissible in law.
5.       While calculating the period of limitation, the Appellant included the time taken by the State Commission, Odisha. Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 clearly provides that if the case is being prosecuted in good faith in a Court of wrong jurisdiction, the time taken by that Court shall not be calculated for the purpose of limitation.
6.       Learned counsel for the Appellant further argued that State Commission had not taken into consideration the fact that the Appellant was not made a party in Complaint case CC/20/2016 filed before the State Commission, Odisha and inclusion of his name in the complaint case CC/71/2019 filed before the State Commission, West Bengal was not permissible in law. In the present case, the State Commission very categorically mentioned that they were only considering the prayer for condonation of delay in filing the case and not the delay in adding a party, which can be done at any stage of the case. State Commission left the issue open regarding impleadment of Appellant as an Opposite Party. State Commission had taken note of the contention of the Appellant and admitted the case. As seen from the impugned order the case is posted for 28.01.2020.
","8.       In view of the above discussion, I find no illegality or infirmity in the order of the State Commission. The Appeal is hereby dismissed.
9.       Parties to appear before the State Commission on 23.3.2020.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Late. Mr. Sunil Seth obtained a Personal Accident Insurance (Individual) Policy from the Opposite Party for the period from 17.09.2016 to 16.09.2017 whereunder a sum of Rs.5875000/- was payable by the insurer in case he was to die in an accident.  Late Mr. Sunil Seth met with a fatal accident while driving a motor-cycle near Manesar in Haryana on 05.02.2017.  A claim in terms of the above-referred policy was lodged by the complainant with the insurer which appointed M/s Somen Media as the surveyor to assess the loss.  Vide their report dated 27.06.2017 the surveyor concluded that the death of Mr. Sunil Seth took place genuinely in a road accident and recommended that the claim may be processed accordingly as per the terms and conditions of the policy and its coverage.  The claim, however, was repudiated by the insurer vide letter dated 20.07.2017 which, to the extent it is relevant, reads thus:-
“The claim  is repudiated as per Exception No. 5(a) of the policy which stands as “The Company shall not be liable under this policy for Payment of compensation in respect of Death, Injury or Disablement of the Insured from Intentional self-injury”.  The grounds of repudiation of the claim are as under:-
It has been informed by you that Sh. Sunil Seth while driving a motorcycle has met with an accident and has expired due to the injuries sustained in the said accident.  You being the legal heirs of the deceased had sought the amount under the policy.
The company on receipt of intimation has deputed M/s Somen Media for the investigation of the claim.  The said investigator after making detailed enquiries have submitted their report along with various documents collected by them.  The said report along with the documents have been examined by the company.
In terms of the said report, it has come on record that a company namely M/s Eagle Rider has given on hire basis a high end motorcycle to one Sh. Neeraj Sethi, in terms of the hire agreement which was executed between the said company and Mr. Neeraj Sethi, Mr. Neeraj Sethi was only competent to drive the said motorcycle.  No other person had any right to drive the said motorcycle. It has also been come up during the investigation that any person who intends to drive the said motorcycle is required to undergo Orientation Program which admittedly Mr. Sunil Seth has not undergone.  Mr. Sunil Seth in an unauthorized manner without any requisite experience and knowledge was trying to move the said high end motorcycle.  That in this process he lost control and sustained injuries.  The policy which was extended by the company provide for indemnification in case of accident.  The accident means some sudden and unexpected event taking place without expectations.
In the present case Mr. Sunil Seth was well aware of the implications and even then he has taken away the vehicle from an actual hirer without the permission of M/s Eagle Rider.  The deceased by doing so not only controverted the terms of the agreement between Sh. Neeraj Sethi and M/s Eagle Rider but also exposed himself to all the risk of getting injuries.  The deceased in the present case was well aware of the consequence of mishandling of such type of the motorcycle. The deceased had no basic knowledge to handle such type of motorcycle and deceased by taking the said vehicle without authority has invited the incidence.  The sequence of events nowhere proves accidental injuries which is pre-requisite for payment of insured amount under the policy.”
2.      Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim the complainant is before this Commission.
3.      The complaint has been resisted by the opposite party which has taken a preliminary objection that this Commission lack pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the consumer complaint.  On merits the complaint has been resisted primarily on the ground on which the claim had been repudiated.
4.      In terms of Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which was in force at the time this complaint was instituted, this Commission had pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the consumer complaint where the value of the goods or the services as the case might be and the compensation claimed by the complainant exceeded Rs.1,00,00,000/-.  A perusal of the consumer complaint would show that the complainant sought the following reliefs against the opposite party in this complaint:-
“i) Allow the instant Complaint and direct the Opposite Party to forthwith pay the Sum Insured being an amount of Rs.58,75,000/-;
ii) Direct the Opposite Party to pay Rs.16,57,233/- as interest @ 24% p.a. on the Sum Insured being a sum of Rs. 58,75,000/- from 5th February, 2017 till the date of filing of the present Complaint, by way of compensation.
iii)        Direct the Opposite party to pay pendent lite and future interest @ 24% p.a. on the Sum Insured being a sum of Rs.58,75,000 w.e.f. the date of filing of the present Complaint till the date of actual payment.
iv)        Direct the Opposite Party to pay an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation towards mental agony, harassment and trauma suffered by the complainant.”
5.      Though the amount payable to the complainant in case of death of the insured in an accident was Rs.58,75,000/-, the complainant having claimed a sum of Rs.58,00,000/- towards mental harassment and trauma alleged to have been suffered by her on account of the opposite party having denied her claim, the total amount claimed by the complainant comes to more than Rs.1,00,00,000/-.  Therefore, this Commission did have requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the consumer complaint. In my view it cannot be said that in no case, whatsoever, an insurer can be asked to pay any amount beyond the sum insured to the complainant.  Whether any compensation, over and above, the sum insured should be awarded in a given case or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of the individual case.  Therefore, it would be difficult to say that merely because the sum insured was only Rs.58,75,000/-  this Commission would not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.
6.      Coming to the merits of the case in view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Galada Power and Telecommunication Limited Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. & Anr. (2016) 14 SCC 161,  the insurer cannot be allowed to contest the consumer complaint beyond the ground on which the claim has been repudiated.  A perusal of the repudiation letter would show that the claim was repudiated solely on the ground that M/s Eagle Rider who had given the motor cycle to its pillion rider Mr. Neeraj Sethi on hire had advised  the person driving the motor-cycle to undergo an orientation and the deceased had not undergone such orientation with the vehicle before he drove the vehicle and, therefore, this was a case of intentional self-injury.  The use of the term ‘intentional self-injury’ in the insurance policy would mean that the person who suffered the injury must have wanted such an injury to be caused to him.  Ordinarily, this would happen in a case where a person either wants to committee suicide or he wants to cause injury to himself.  The intention of a person is a state of mind which cannot be proved by way of direct evidence but has to be inferred from the attending facts and circumstances.  There is no evidence to prove that Late Sh. Sunil Seth wanted to commit suicide or he wanted to cause injury to himself.  Therefore, there was no basis for the insurer to even claim that this is a case of intentional self-injury.  In my opinion an intentional self-injury cannot be inferred even if driving this particular motor-cycle required some special orientation or even a special training which late Mr. Sunil Seth did not possess.  M/s Eagle Rider owned the vehicle and, therefore, must be quite keen to insure that the vehicle is not damaged while being driven by the hirer.  That would the purpose of requiring the hirer to take an orientation of the vehicle so that he is able to familiarize himself with the machine being taken on hire and did not cause an accident resulting in damage to the vehicle.  A person driving a high-end motor cycle without taking the orientation which the owner of the vehicle wants to be taken by the driver of the vehicle may be said to be negligent if he drives the vehicle without such an orientation, but it can never be said that his intention behind driving such a motor cycle without orientation, desired by its owner, was to cause injury to himself.  A negligent act such as driving a motor cycle without taking the orientation desired by its owner can never be equated with an intentional self-injury if driving the vehicle result in an accident.  The intention being a state of mind required resolve on the part of the insured to either kill himself or to cause injury to himself.  If a person drives a vehicle without having a driving licence it would be difficult to say that his intention is to cause self-injury.  The intention of such a person would be to enjoy the driving though he may not be possessing the skill required for the purpose.  If a person driving a vehicle meets with an accident it would be difficult to say merely from his driving without a licence that his intention was to cause injury to himself.  The position of a person who otherwise possesses a valid driving licence but does not take the orientation advised by the owner giving the vehicle on hire would be much better than the position of a person driving a vehicle without requisite licence.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the present case was not covered under exception No. 5(a) of the policy.
","7.      The complaint is disposed of in terms of the following directions:-
(i)      The opposite party shall pay a sum of Rs.58,75,000/- to the complainant along-with compensation in form of simple interest on that amount @ 8% p.a. w.e.f. 6 months from the date of lodgement of the claim till the date of payment.  A period of six months is available to the insurer for settling the claim, in terms of Regulation 9 of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protection of Policyholders' Interests) Regulations 2002.
(ii)      The opposite party shall pay a sum of Rs.50,000/- as costs of litigation to the complainant.
(iii)     The payment in terms of this order shall be made within 3 months from today.

For Respondent no.2				Mr Sanjeev Goyal, Advocate 
","One of the petitioners is present in person who states that his counsel is unable to come from Delhi, hence, adjournment is sought. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 is present and states that he is putting his appearance. Circuit benches are being organised to help consumers so that their case may be disposed of locally and they need not come to Delhi. From this angle, I perused the file. It is seen that the brief facts of the case are that the complainant has got sanctioned a loan of Rs.4,50,000/- and obtained a loan of Rs.3,90,000/- from opposite party no.1 for the construction of Rural Godown under the NABARD Scheme. The opposite party no. 2 was to pay the subsidy on the above amount and the OP no.1 was to submit the case for subsidy to OP No.2. After availing the loan, the complainant allegedly constructed the godown as per the specifications. A joint committee inspected the rural godown and made a report with regard to the godown of the complainant that the same was not constructed as per the specifications of the NABARD. The complainants were intimated about this vide letter dated 30.01.2006. The complainant’s case has been that the inspection was not correct as no opportunity was given of being heard before rejecting their claim of subsidy.
2.     The complainants filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum with the following prayer:
It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that the present complaint may kindly be accepted and the opposite parties may kindly be directed to release the amount of subsidy along with interest at the rate of 1% per annum from the date the same was due for payment till its actual payment and further the opposite party may also be directed to pay the compensation on account of harassment and mental agony to the tune of Rs.50,000/-.
3.     The District Forum, however, dismissed the complaint as complainants have not themselves completed the work as per terms and conditions of advanced loan and taking of subsidy as per report, thus complainants are not entitled to any subsidy.
4.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum the petitioner/ complainant preferred an appeal before the State Commission being FA no. 1331 of 2009. The State Commission vide its order dated 21.08.2013, dismissed the appeal filed by the complainant. At the time of inspection it was found that there was no complete godown in existence and also it was found that it was an old incomplete structure which was proved on record through the inspection report.
5.     Hence, the present revision petition.
6.     From the facts of the case and from the prayer of the complaint, it is clear that the main issue to be decided in the present case is about the release of amount of subsidy. The issue of subsidy cannot be decided by the Consumer Forum as has been held by the National Commission in the case of Chaudhary Ashok Yadav vs The Rewari Central Co-operative Bank and Anr., Revision petition no.4894 of 2012 decided on 08.02.2013, wherein it has been held that a person seeking benefit of subsidy under a scheme is not a ‘consumer’, as the subsidy is not a service within the meaning of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and his remedy does not lie under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 by filing a complaint and that he can seek relief from a civil court, or some other forum, as per law.
","7.     Based on the judgment of this Commission in the case of Chaudhary Ashok Yadav vs The Rewari Central Co-operative Bank and Anr. (Supra), I am of the view that the issue of subsidy cannot be decided by this Commission as the subsidy seeker is not a consumer within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The District Forum and the State Commission have rightly dismissed the complaint. In these circumstances, I do not find any prudence in waiting for the counsel to argue the matter on some other date as it would be unnecessarily prolonging the period of litigation. Hence, the request for adjournment is rejected.
8.     It is further seen that both the fora below have given concurrent finding of fact that the godown was not complete and the construction was not as per specification. Against the concurrent finding of facts, the scope under the revision petition is quite limited and facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mrs Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 2011 (3) Scale 654 as follows:
“23. Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
9.     On the basis of above discussion, I do not find any merit in the present revision petition. Accordingly, the revision petition no. 1109 of 2014 is dismissed. However, liberty is granted to the petitioners to approach the civil court, if so advised. The time taken before the District Forum, State Commission and this Commission will not be considered for limitation under Section 14 of the Limitation Act.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Ashis Chakraborty, Advocate 
","1.       The present Appeal is filed by the Appellants under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order dated 26.12.2019 passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No. 39/2015.
2.       The Respondent is a distributor of ITC Cigarettes. The case of the Complainant/Respondent is that six insurance policies were taken from the Appellant Insurance Company. On 23.06.2012 at 10.30 pm, he closed his office-cum-godown and on his return on 25.06.2012 it was found that forcible entry was made by unknown elements by breaking open the gate and padlock of the godown, escaping with different brands of ITC cigarettes. FIR No.25661 was lodged with the local police station on 25.06.2012 and insurance claim was also made on the same date. The Insurance Company deputed a Surveyor, who assessed the loss. Appellant No.4/Opposite Party No.4, however, vide letter dated 05.02.2014, repudiated the claim. Hence complaint case was filed with the following prayer: -
“a.    an order to pay an amount of Rs.29,51,358.00 (Rupees twenty Nine Lakhs Fifty One Thousand and Three Hundred Fifty Eight) only being the burglary insurance claim to your petitioner under policy Nos.100304/11/11/3100000043 being claim No.10034/11/12/ 3100000050 for the period 25.06.2012 to 24.06.2013.
b.       An order to pay an interest @ 12% per annum on Rs.29,51,358.00 only from the date of lodging of the claim that is from 25.06.2012 till payment of the insurance claim.
c.       An order to pay Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) only as compensation on account of harassment.
d.       An order to pay Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One lakh) only as compensation on account of pain, suffering and mental agony for losing the earning livelihood.
e.       An order to pay cost of litigation of Rs.25,000.00 (Rupees Twenty Five Thousand) only.
f.        Any other and further order or orders as to this Hon’ble Commission may deem fit and proper.”
3.       The case was contested by the Appellants/Opposite Parties by filing a written statement denying all the averments made in the Complaint, the short point for consideration in this case being the currency of the insurance policy as on the date of the incident.
","4.       The State Commission heard the learned Counsels for the parties. It framed five issues and dismissed each one of them. The State Commission allowed the Complaint on contest against Appellants/Opposite Parties 1 to 4 and dismissed ex-parte against Opposite Party No.5. The State Commission vide order dated 24.03.2017, directed the Opposite Parties as follows: -
“That CC/39/2015 be and the same is allowed on contest against the OP Nos. 1 to 4 and dismissed ex parte against the OP No.5. OP Nos. 1 to 4 to pay jointly and severally a sum of Rs.24,10,230/-. These OPs were to comply with the order within 40 days from the date of this order, i.d., OP Insurer shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% p.a. over the aforesaid awarded sum from this day till full and final payment is made.”
5.       Heard the Learned Counsels for the Parties and carefully perused the record.
6.       The main issue for consideration in the present Appeal is whether the Respondent/Complainant had a valid insurance policy as on the date of the incident. The Respondent/Complainant had taken Insurance policy for the period 25.06.2012 to 24.06.2013. Premium amount of Rs.32,969/- was paid to the Appellant/Opposite Party. There was a forcible entry into the premises of the Respondent as evident from the FIR lodged with the police station. The Surveyor noted in his final survey report that locks of the gate were broken and the said broken locks were seized by the police. In its FRT, the police admitted the factum of stealing of cigarettes from the godown of the Complainant. The burglary got wide publicity in the newspapers that the burglary took place on Sunday night i.e. night of 24.06.2012. FIR clearly stated that the incident took place sometime between 23.30 hours on 23.06.2012 and 4.30 hours of 25.06.2012. Since the insurance policy was valid till mid-night of 24.06.2012, there is no justification to repudiate the claim on the ground that the burglary took place beyond the currency of the policy. The surveyor had also not stated that the burglary happened after the validity of the policy nor did he recommend repudiation of the claim. The Appellant/Opposite Party also could not produce any documentary proof/evidence in support of its contention. The State Commission, therefore, held that repudiation of the claim by the Appellant/Opposite Party was not justified.
7.       The Surveyor in his report assessed the loss at Rs.24,10,230/-. The State Commission rightly allowed the Complaint and held that the Complainant was entitled to get Rs.24,10,230/- from the Appellant/Opposite Parties.
7.       For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the order of the State Commission.  There is no merit in the Appeal.  The order of the State Commission is confirmed and the Appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs. All the pending interim applications also stand dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
These appeals are directed against the orders of the State Commission dated 17.03.2017 whereby the Consumer Complaints instituted by the respondents were allowed in terms of the directions given in the said order.  The complainants/respondents booked residential apartments with the appellant in a project namely ‘Sterling Apartments’ which the appellant was to construct in Village Kurla of Mumbai Suburban District.  The agreements between the parties were executed and the possession of the flats was to be delivered to the complainants within two years of the execution of the agreements.  The possession having not been delivered to them, the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking possession of the allotted flat alongwith interest @ 21% per annum in addition to compensation for the mental agony and harassment.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the appellant which admitted the allotment made to the complainants.  It was interalia stated in the written version that the complainants had defaulted in making payments but despite such defaults, no interest was charged from them.  It was also stated that the construction was delayed on account of reasons beyond the control of the appellant.
3.      Since there is a delay of more than one year in institution of these appeals, applications seeking condonation of the said delay have been filed by the appellant.  The said applications, to the extent they are relevant, read as under:
2.      The applicants state that after receipt of the order on 12/4/2017, the respondents i.e. the org Complainant had approached the Appellant for discussing the settlement of the issue. The Applicants had agreed to complete the construction work as soon as possible and will provide all the amenities such as water, light and lift etc.
3.      The applicants submits that since, there was/is bonafide intention to give possession of flat to respondent and therefore, a meeting was fixed with respondent. In the meeting of exploring settlement, the respondent with malafide intention, agreed that they will not ask for monetary claims if the possession is handed over to respondents by the applicants.
4.      The applicants failed to understand that this was just and trick played by the respondents so that the time period to file appeal should passed over.  The respondents all the time agreed for settlement of case and insisted that respondents will not ask for monetary claims in view of the settlement.
5.      The applicants states that long period of time was wasted by the respondents under the name of settlement and sole intention of the respondents to mislead applicants and avoid filing of the appeal.
6.      Thereafter, applicants mother was suffering from brain hemorrhage and was admitted in hospital for treatment and therefore, applicant could not file the appeal before this Hon’ble Commission.  The copy of discharge card enclosed herewith.
9.      The applicants submit that the settlement was just a trick to waste time of applicants.  Hence there is delay in filing the present appeal which is not deliberate or intentional and hence this application seeking condonation of delay in filing the present appeal.
4.      It would thus be seen that two grounds have been taken by the appellant while seeking condonation of delay in institution of these appeals.  The first ground taken by the appellant is that the parties were negotiating for quite some time and therefore, they wanted to resolve the matter instead of challenging the order passed by the State Commission.  However, there is absolutely no document evidencing the alleged negotiations between the parties after the order of the State Commission.  No particulars of the alleged meetings and negotiations have been given in the application.  It is not directed on which date the negotiations were held, where they were held and who were present in the meetings.  The learned counsel for the complainants denies any such meetings or negotiations between the parties.  In the absence of any document in this regard and particulars of the alleged meetings, the plea taken by the appellant cannot be accepted.  In any case, the appellant ought to have approached this Commission, instead of spending time on negotiations and allowing the appeals to become time barred in the meanwhile, since the negotiations could have been held even after instituting the appeal within the prescribed period of limitation.
5.      The second ground given by the appellant is that the mother of the partners of appellant no. 1 was hospitalized and therefore, they were unable to file the appeal, both the brothers being busy in the treatment of their mother.  During the course of hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant stated that the mother of the partners of the firm was hospitalized on 15.02.2017 and was discharged from there on 10.07.2017.  Though it is rather difficult to accept that throughout this period of almost five months, both the partners were held up in the hospital where their mother was admitted, even if the benefit of the aforesaid period, between 15.02.2017 to 10.07.2017, is given.  These appeals having been instituted on 18.05.2018, more than ten months after the mother of the partners of the firm was discharged from the hospital, there is no explanation for the aforesaid delay of more than ten months in approaching this Commission after discharge of the mother from the hospital.  Therefore, from whatever angle I may look at it, I find no justification in condoning the delay of more than one year in institution of these appeals.
6.      This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the complainants that the impugned order has already been accepted by the appellant, who had undertaken, before the State Commission, to pay 50% of the compensation amount, within a particular period.
7.      It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant and rightly so that the interest awarded by the State Commission is very much on the higher side, the same being as much as 21% per annum, however, since the appeals are barred by limitation and the complainants are not ready to accept lesser interest, no justified ground for condonation of delay has been shown, it is not permissible for this Commission to examine the order of the State Commission on merits.
","8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are dismissed as barred by limitation, with no order as to costs.

1.       Delay of eight days in filing of this Appeal Execution is condoned for the reasons stated in the Application for Condonation of Delay.
2.       The present Appeal Execution has been filed by the Judgment Debtors, who were Opposite Parties before the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission at Chandigarh (in short, ‘the State Commission), against the Order dated 04-04-2018 passed by the State Commission in Execution Application No.102 of 2017, arising out of
Order dated 10-03-2017 in Consumer Complaint No.140 of 2016, whereby the State Commission has directed the Opposite Parties/Judgment Debtors to refund the amount deducted by them towards Service Tax and TDS to the Complainant/Decree Holder on or before 25-04-2018 by way of demand draft.
3.       We have heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellants and the father of the Respondent, who is appearing in person and perused the impugned order passed by the State Commission.
4.       The Learned Counsel for the Appellants, in her written arguments, placing reliance on the order dated 22-08-2016 of the Hon’ble National Commission in Consumer Complaint No.142 of 2009 titled Sunrise Green Residents Welfare Association Vs. Jaipuria Infrastructure Developers Pvt. Ltd. and order dated 12-08-2016 of the Hon’ble National Commission in the matter of Kuntal Debnath Vs. Director, RDB Industries Ltd., 2016, SCC Online NCDRC 2045, which have attained finality, vehemently contended that the issue of refund of deposit of statutory dues towards Service Tax and TDS is no more res integra and the impugned order has been passed in ignoranitum of the settled position of law; that the Respondent sought refund of the amount deposited with the Appellants vide his letter dated 01-06-2015 in terms of Clause 3(II) of the Letter of Intent, which was granted in full in the month of August, 2015, after deduction of statutory dues pertaining to Service Tax and TDS; that the Service Tax has been charged and deposited in consonance with the provisions of Section 65(105)(zzzh) and Section 66E of the Finance Act; that in pursuance of the statutory law and Circular No.151/2/2012-ST dated 10-10-2012 issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Appellants had deposited the Service Tax with the concerned Revenue Department on 24-11-2012.
5.       The Learned Counsel for the Appellants further submitted that the Central Government in its Budget of 2010-2011 had imposed tax liability (Service Tax) on all under construction properties w.e.f.01-07-2010. The same was challenged by many Real Estate Developers and Builders but the matter was eventually decided by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in favour of the Government. Consequently, Service Tax on under construction property was liable to be paid @3.75% on the total price paid for the purchase of an under construction property by the Developers. In order to remove such confusion, the Government, while introducing the Negative List of Services (applicable from 1st July, 2012) has very specifically in the definition of Service contained in Clause 44 of Section 65B of the Act stated that Services include Declared Services. The Government also mentioned the activities like construction of complex, building, civil structure or part thereof as Declared Service. The learned counsel further submitted that a decision was taken by the Chief Administrator, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) on      23-06-2015, which was not challenged, to deduct the Service Tax from the amount of refund, since the same has been deposited by GMADA.
6.       As part of her contentions, the learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that the Appellants have deducted TDS only on the amount of interest and not from the compensation, as awarded by the State Commission in consonance with provisions of Sections 194A and 2(28)A of the Income Tax Act, 1995 and deposited the same with the concerned Revenue Department on 05-11-2015 which was deposited for the period from 01-07-2015 to 30-09-2015 in the Assessment Year of 2016-2017. She further contended that the impugned order dated 04-04-2018 is sans jurisdiction and is based on assumptions contrary to the letter and spirit of the order dated 10-03-2017 passed in the Complaint and is liable to be set aside to the extent it directs refund of the Service Tax and TDS which is legitimately deducted by the Appellants.
7.       To the contrary, the father of the Respondent, Mr. Viney Kumar Mutneja, in his written arguments, raised rival contentions that the amount of Rs.21,321/-, deducted on account of Service Tax by the Appellants and not refunded to the Respondent is unauthorized and is payable to the Respondent in view of the order dated 10-03-2017 quoting the statutory provisions of the Service Tax Laws, of the State Commission passed in the Complaint
Case and order dated 04-04-2018 passed by the State Commission in Execution Application. The Respondent has also placed reliance on Clause 2.3, namely, ‘Investment Model’ of Circular No.151/2/2012-ST dt.10-02-2012 of Government of India, Ministry of Finance, CBEC and contended that there is no ambiguity about the refund of the Service Tax by the Appellants since the Respondent has withdrawn from the Scheme. Moreover, the Respondent is not Service Tax Assessee and cannot claim refund from the CBEC and only the Appellants can take the refund.
8.       The father of the Respondent further contended that the amount of tax deducted in the year 2015-16 of Rs.11,239/- and Rs.1,94,407/- deducted in the year 2017-18 is unauthorized and refundable by the Appellants because the interest which has been awarded by the Hon’ble State Commission is not on account of any deposits made by the Respondent with the Appellants, but for compensation or damages for delay in construction of the flat or handing over the possession of the same causing consequential loss to the Respondent by way of escalation in the price of the property during the last five years and also on account of depriving of the use of money to which the Respondent is legitimately entitled. That the word interest has been used in the order of the State Commission as a convenient method of calculating the amount of compensation/damages and does not mean interest as defined in Section 2(28-A) of the Income Tax Act. That the Appellants are exempted from deduction of TDC under Section 194A of Income Tax Act, on interest payments in such cases since such interest payment does not come under the purview of Section 2(28-A) of the Income Tax Act. He has placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble National Commission in R.P.No.2244 of 1999, G.D.A. Vs. Dr. N. K. Gupta, order dated 28-11-2011 of High Court of Himachal Pradesh in Commissioner of Income Tax, Shimla Vs. H.P. Housing Board, Shimla, order dated 02-12-2015 of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Vs. Department of Income Tax. The father of the Respondent has also emphasized that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeals No.8400 of 2000, GDA Vs. Naresh Kumar Sharma and No.7224 of 2002, GDA Vs. Chander Bhan Singh have vindicated the stand of the Hon’ble National Commission and State Commission and have ordered to GDA for refund of TDS deducted along with 18% rate of interest till the date of refund.
9.       At this juncture, we would like to place reliance on the judgment of the National Commission in the case of GDAVs. Dr. N. K. Gupta, R.P.No.2244 of 1999 decided on 18.09.2002, the relevant observations made wherein are reproduced as hereunder:
“…..The amounts which were paid to the GDA by the Complainant were not paid by way of any deposit or GDA had not borrowed that money.
…..Here interest payment is by way of damages. Merely describing the damages as by way of interest do not make them as interest under the Income Tax Act.
…..The word interest used in the order of the State Commission is not what interest is as defined in Section 2(28-A) of the Income Tax Act.
….In our view, therefore, considering the definition of 'interest' as contained in Section 2(28-A) of the Income Tax Act, provisions of Section 194-A were not applicable and the GDA was clearly wrong in deducting the TDS from the interest payable to the Complainant.”
10.     We further place reliance on the judgment of the National Commission in the bunch of cases titled as Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. &Ors. Vs. AbhaArora&Ors., IV (2018) CPJ 441 (NC),therelevant observation made wherein is reproduced as hereunder:
“We may mention here that even though the Complainants have been granted simple interest of 12% p.a. or 9% p.a. but as the same has been awarded by way of damages the Appellant who has been directed to pay the said amount shall not deduct tax (T.D.S.) under the Income Tax Act, 1961 as it is not payment of any interest but only a formula for computation of damages.”
11.     In our considered view, the submissions made by the Learned Counsel for the Appellants are wholly misconceived. The Appellants/Judgment Debtors, during the pendency of the Execution Application, have paid Rs.17,20,638/- to the Complainants on 23-08-2017 vide DD No.662680 and Rs.2,50,018/- on 07-09-2017 vide DD No.662684 and they have been directed to pay the amount deducted by them as Service Tax and TDS to the Complainants. On careful perusal of the impugned order passed by the State Commission, we find that the Learned Counsel for the Appellants have raised the same pleas which were raised before the State Commission in Execution Application and the same have been substantially considered by the State Commission while deciding the Execution Application vide order dated 04-04-2018. We are in complete agreement with the view taken and findings recorded by the State Commission and find no good ground to interfere with the well-reasoned order passed by the State Commission. The attempt of the Learned Counsel for the Appellants in again raising the same pleas as well as the question of jurisdiction, etc., cannot be permitted in the Execution Proceedings.
","12.     In the result, the Execution Appeal preferred by the Appellants is hereby dismissed.
13.     There shall be no orders as to costs.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
These appeals are directed against the orders of the State Commission dated 17.03.2017 whereby the Consumer Complaints instituted by the respondents were allowed in terms of the directions given in the said order.  The complainants/respondents booked residential apartments with the appellant in a project namely ‘Sterling Apartments’ which the appellant was to construct in Village Kurla of Mumbai Suburban District.  The agreements between the parties were executed and the possession of the flats was to be delivered to the complainants within two years of the execution of the agreements.  The possession having not been delivered to them, the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking possession of the allotted flat alongwith interest @ 21% per annum in addition to compensation for the mental agony and harassment.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the appellant which admitted the allotment made to the complainants.  It was interalia stated in the written version that the complainants had defaulted in making payments but despite such defaults, no interest was charged from them.  It was also stated that the construction was delayed on account of reasons beyond the control of the appellant.
3.      Since there is a delay of more than one year in institution of these appeals, applications seeking condonation of the said delay have been filed by the appellant.  The said applications, to the extent they are relevant, read as under:
2.      The applicants state that after receipt of the order on 12/4/2017, the respondents i.e. the org Complainant had approached the Appellant for discussing the settlement of the issue. The Applicants had agreed to complete the construction work as soon as possible and will provide all the amenities such as water, light and lift etc.
3.      The applicants submits that since, there was/is bonafide intention to give possession of flat to respondent and therefore, a meeting was fixed with respondent. In the meeting of exploring settlement, the respondent with malafide intention, agreed that they will not ask for monetary claims if the possession is handed over to respondents by the applicants.
4.      The applicants failed to understand that this was just and trick played by the respondents so that the time period to file appeal should passed over.  The respondents all the time agreed for settlement of case and insisted that respondents will not ask for monetary claims in view of the settlement.
5.      The applicants states that long period of time was wasted by the respondents under the name of settlement and sole intention of the respondents to mislead applicants and avoid filing of the appeal.
6.      Thereafter, applicants mother was suffering from brain hemorrhage and was admitted in hospital for treatment and therefore, applicant could not file the appeal before this Hon’ble Commission.  The copy of discharge card enclosed herewith.
9.      The applicants submit that the settlement was just a trick to waste time of applicants.  Hence there is delay in filing the present appeal which is not deliberate or intentional and hence this application seeking condonation of delay in filing the present appeal.
4.      It would thus be seen that two grounds have been taken by the appellant while seeking condonation of delay in institution of these appeals.  The first ground taken by the appellant is that the parties were negotiating for quite some time and therefore, they wanted to resolve the matter instead of challenging the order passed by the State Commission.  However, there is absolutely no document evidencing the alleged negotiations between the parties after the order of the State Commission.  No particulars of the alleged meetings and negotiations have been given in the application.  It is not directed on which date the negotiations were held, where they were held and who were present in the meetings.  The learned counsel for the complainants denies any such meetings or negotiations between the parties.  In the absence of any document in this regard and particulars of the alleged meetings, the plea taken by the appellant cannot be accepted.  In any case, the appellant ought to have approached this Commission, instead of spending time on negotiations and allowing the appeals to become time barred in the meanwhile, since the negotiations could have been held even after instituting the appeal within the prescribed period of limitation.
5.      The second ground given by the appellant is that the mother of the partners of appellant no. 1 was hospitalized and therefore, they were unable to file the appeal, both the brothers being busy in the treatment of their mother.  During the course of hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant stated that the mother of the partners of the firm was hospitalized on 15.02.2017 and was discharged from there on 10.07.2017.  Though it is rather difficult to accept that throughout this period of almost five months, both the partners were held up in the hospital where their mother was admitted, even if the benefit of the aforesaid period, between 15.02.2017 to 10.07.2017, is given.  These appeals having been instituted on 18.05.2018, more than ten months after the mother of the partners of the firm was discharged from the hospital, there is no explanation for the aforesaid delay of more than ten months in approaching this Commission after discharge of the mother from the hospital.  Therefore, from whatever angle I may look at it, I find no justification in condoning the delay of more than one year in institution of these appeals.
6.      This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the complainants that the impugned order has already been accepted by the appellant, who had undertaken, before the State Commission, to pay 50% of the compensation amount, within a particular period.
7.      It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant and rightly so that the interest awarded by the State Commission is very much on the higher side, the same being as much as 21% per annum, however, since the appeals are barred by limitation and the complainants are not ready to accept lesser interest, no justified ground for condonation of delay has been shown, it is not permissible for this Commission to examine the order of the State Commission on merits.
","8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are dismissed as barred by limitation, with no order as to costs.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
This Order shall dispose of seven revision petitions arising against the common impugned Order of the State Commission Punjab passed on 18.12.2017 in the appeals filed by the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (now BDA), Bathinda ( hereinafter referred as ‘PUDA’- ‘OP’).
Brief facts of the case are that the complainant had applied for a plot in the scheme launched by the PUDA for free hold residential plots in PUDA Enclave at Budhlada. The complainants initially deposited the earnest money and subsequently 15% of the total value of the plot was paid after being successful in the draw of lots and after receiving the letter of intent. The possession was to be handed over after the completion of development work at the site or within 18 months from the date of issuance of allotment letter, whichever was earlier. PUDA issued a letter of intent dated 26.02.2013 to the each complainant. The OP neither developed any plot nor delivered the possession to the complainants. Being aggrieved the seven complainants filed separate complaints before the District Forum, Mansa.
3.      The District Forum after considering the pleadings and evidence  allowed the complaint and directed to refund the amount received by the OP from the complainant alongwith interest @ 9% per annum from the date of receipt till the date of payment, and also directed to pay Rs. 7,000/- as compensation and another Rs. 3,000/- as litigation expenses.
4.      Being aggrieved by the order of District Forum, the OP filed seven separate first appeal before the State Commission. All the appeals are dismissed by the State Commission by a common order dated 18.12.2017.   and the Order of the District Forum was affirmed.
Hence, these seven revision petitions filed by the OP- PUDA before this Commission.
5.      We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and None present for the respondents except the respondent Ms.Veena Rani (in RP/2846/2018).
Perused the entire material on record.
6.      Admittedly as per the terms of PUDA the seven complainants have paid the earnest money as per the area of the plot applied for. They have also paid the stipulated amount i.e. 15% of the total cost  as per the PUDA stipulation. The details of payment are stated as below:

7.      We note the State Commission categorically made the following observations:
25.     - - - There is nothing on the record to indicate that any allotment letter mentioning the plot number has been issued to the complainant at the instance of OP in this case. Merely placing on record incomplete proforma of the allotment letter of residential plot Ex.OP-2 does not show that the OP has clear cut intention to develop the project within the reasonable time frame. The complainants want refund of their money and they do not pray for delivery of possession of the plots to them in the above cases. In the circumstances of the case, when complainants do not pray for delivery of possession and only pray for refund of money, we find that District Forum rightly appreciated controversy in this case and directed the OP to refund the entire deposited amount of complainant with interest @ 9 % from the date of receipt till the date of payment and costs of litigation for non-development of project by OP within the stipulated/ scheduled time.
","26.     As a result of our above discussion, all the above referred appeals are dismissed by affirming the orders of District Forum Mansa dated 10.03.2017 under challenge in these cases.
8.      On perusal of the record, prima-facie it is the case of deficiency of service by the OP. Non-commencement of development work appears to be a casual approach of the PUDA and unnecessarily harassment to the poor consumers. Even after the expiry of four years, no development work has been started at the site. Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in many cases that if there is a delay in possession, the allottee or consumer is entitled for refund with a reasonable interest.
9.      In Fortune Infrastructure & Anr. v. Trevor D’ Lima & Ors, II (2018) CPJ 1 (SC), Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the flat allotted to him , and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid by him, alongwith compensation. Similarly, in Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank, II 2007 CPJ 17 (SC), Hon’ble Supreme Court held that when possession of the allotted plot/flat/house is not delivered within the specified time, the allottee is entitled to refund with reasonable interest from the date of payment till the date of refund.
Public authorities cannot frisk with the hard- earned money of consumers.
10.    Based on the foregoing discussions, all the revision petitions are dismissed with a stern advise of caution to the OP- Authority through imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/- in each case out of which Rs. 25,000/- shall be paid to the complainants and the remaining Rs. 25,000/- shall be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum within four weeks from today.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
11.   The learned Counsel for the Revisionist Development Authority (PUDA, now BDA) was heard.
The Complainant in Revision Petition No. 2842 of 2018, who was present in person, was heard.
None was present for the Complainants in the other 06 Revision Petitions.
The record was perused, including inter alia the Orders (07 nos.) dated 10.03.2017 of the District Forum, the impugned Order dated 18.12.2017 of the State Commission and the Memoranda of Petition in all the 07 Revision Petitions.
12.   The short point involved here is that the Complainants deposited earnest money and made further deposits with the Development Authority for residential plots. The plots were not developed within the assured period, or within a reasonable period thence.
13.   The District Forum, vide its individual Orders (07 nos.) dated 10.03.2017, ordered refund of the respective deposited amount(s) with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the respective dates of deposit till realization along with compensation of Rs. 7,000/- and cost of litigation of Rs. 3,000/-, in each case.
The Development Authority filed 07 Appeals under Section 15 of the Act 1986 before the State Commission, challenging the said 07 individual Orders dated 10.03.2017 of the District Forum.
The State Commission, vide a common Order dated 18.12.2017, dismissed the said 07 Appeals and affirmed the Orders (07 nos.) of the District Forum.
The Development Authority filed the instant 07 Revision Petitions before this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986, one each in respect of each of the 07 Complaint Cases, challenging the said Order dated 18.12.2017 of the State Commission.
14.   Similar facts and same questions of law are involved in all these 07 Revision Petitions.
As such, the 07 Revision Petitions are being disposed of vide a common Order.
15.   We may observe here that it was the prime responsibility of the Development Authority to ensure that it was in a position to develop the plots within the assured period and in all contingencies within a reasonable period thence (reasonable period here would connote such period as a reasonable man would not normally agitate).
Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
(Normal) impediments or problems that arise in Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Specifically, availability of land (/ acquisition of land), as well as all approvals from the concerned Government / Development / Municipal authorities, as and when due, being fundamental basic requirements of a construction / development Project, were decidedly the Development Authority’s primary responsibilities, and not of the Consumer(s).
Cost and Time overruns were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Non-fulfilment of its overall responsibilities of Project Planning, Execution and Completion can not be and are not grounds for condoning or overlooking delay in completion and failure to develop the plots within the assured period.
Managerial or administrative contingencies / exigencies etc., can, but, not be nebulously and irrationally contended and argued for anything and everything related to the Development Authority’s responsibilities for completion of the Project without Cost or Time overruns.
16.   It is well evinced that the subject plots were not developed within the assured period or within a reasonable period thence. In such situation, the District Forum directed for refund of the deposited amount(s) with interest (@ 9% p.a.) along with compensation (Rs.7,000/-) and cost of litigation (Rs. 3,000/-), in each case.
We find the award made by the District Forum to be just and equitable.
17.   The State Commission has concurred with the findings of the District Forum.
We find the impugned Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned.
18.   Within the ambit and scope of Section 21(b), we find no crucial error in appreciating the evidence by the two Fora below, as may cause to require de novo re-appreciation of the evidence in revision.
We find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, as may require interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b).
19.   The Development Authority, after its out-and-out ‘deficiency in service’, clearly falling within Section 2 (1) (g) & (o) of the Act 1986, agitated, unsuccessfully, in one, then two, and now three, Consumer Protection Fora, needlessly wasting public time and monies.
20.   All this is not viewed favourably.
21.   The Revision Petitions, being patently misconceived and totally bereft of merit, are dismissed, with stern advice of caution to the Development Authority by imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/- in each case, out of which Rs. 25,000/- shall be paid to the Complainant(s) in each case and Rs. 25,000/- shall be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum in each case, within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
The Development Authority through its Chief Executive is further advised to inculcate accountability and responsibility and to imbibe systemic improvements, rather than attempting to justify deficient service, mismanagement and maladministration, and wasting public time and monies in meritless litigation.
22.   Needless to add, the protection from execution, provided vide the Order dated 30.05.2019, does not survive. In case of failure or omission in compliance, the District Forum shall undertake execution as per the law.
23.   A copy each of this Order be sent by the Registry to the Chief Executive of the Revisionist Development Authority and to the Complainants in each case, within seven days of its pronouncement.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Surojit Banerjee, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :NEMO 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
Respondent 3 to 26, who are the owners of different plots amalgamated the said plots into a single plot of land and they entered into an agreement with the appellant for construction of a ground + five storied building on the aforesaid amalgamated plot of land.  The complainants entered into agreements with the appellant, for purchasing residential flats in the proposed building.  The possession, as per the agreement, executed by them with the appellant, was to be delivered by January 2013.  The possession however, was delivered to them late,  though it had been delivered before the Consumer Complaint came to be instituted by them.  The Sale Deeds in their favour were also executed.  The complainants then approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints, alleging therein that neither the Completion Certificate had been provided to them, nor had the petitioners completed the remaining works in the building constructed by it.  It was also alleged by them that the building material used by the appellant was inferior, as a result of which, the floors had cracked and the walls of the flats had got damaged.  The following were the prayers made in the Consumer Complaints instituted by them:
Direction may kindly be given upon the opposite party No.1 to complete the work of the common areas and facilities as mentioned in the Schedule “C” herein below and to repair and/or repairs the damages portion of the flat within a specific period;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to pay the interest at the rate of 18% as per agreement for sale and also on account of non-deliver the flat within the time as mentioned in the agreement for sale;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to demolish the illegal and unauthorized construction on the ground floor at their own cost and expenses failing which necessary order may kindly be passed to demolish the said illegal and unauthorized construction at the cost and expenses of the opposite party no.1;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to handover the completion certificate in respect of the Schedule “A” property;
Directing the opposite parties to form flat owners Association in respect of Schedule “A” property;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to install separate electric meter in the name of your petitioner;
Compensation to the tune of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakh) for mental agony and harassment;
Damages to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakh) only for below quality materials used in flat.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the appellant who denied the allegations made in the complaint against it and interalia stated that it had executed the Conveyance Deed in favour of the complainants and delivered possession of the allotted flats as well as the garage to them.  It was also claimed that the flat as well as all the common facilities, amenities etc. were completed at the time the possession was delivered.  It was also claimed in the written version that the lifts had also been installed and were running in good condition.
3.      The State Commission, vide impugned order dated 18.12.2017,  declined all the prayers made by the complainants except the prayer for issuance of a direction to the appellant to hand over the completion certificate to them.  The State Commission also directed the petitioners to pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation and Rs.10,000/- as the cost of litigation, within ten days failing which the said amount was to carry interest @ 8% per annum.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellants are before this Commission by way of these appeals.
5.      The complainants have not filed any cross-appeal challenging the order passed by the State Commission despite the fact that most of the prayers made by them in the Consumer Complaint were declined by the State Commission.  As a result, it is not permissible for this Commission to go into the correctness or otherwise of the said order to the extent the other prayers made by the complainants in the Consumer Complaints were declined.
6.      As noted earlier, the State Commission directed the petitioners to provide completion certificate to the complainants, in addition to awarding compensation to them.  The learned counsel for the appellants has drawn my attention to the Occupancy Certificate purporting to be issued by Dumdum Municipality and available on page no.132 of the paper-book, which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
Subject: Grant of Occupancy Certificate under sub-rule (2) of Rule
of 34.

One set of building plans with endorsement “Approved Completion Plan” is returned herewith (where required).
7.      This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that no certificate other than the Occupancy Certificate extracted hereinabove is required under the rules of the Dumdum Municipality.  He has also drawn my attention to the proceedings recorded by the Assistant Director, Directorate of Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices, Govt. of West Bengal dated 23.07.2015, which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
Both the complainants and opposite party are present for the mediation meeting.  The opposite party have appointed Sri Arunachal Bhattacharjee, Advocate as their representative.
It has been mutually agreed that all the pending works as pointed out lay the complainants including electric connections from C.E.S.E. will be completed within four (04) months of time since today, i.e. 23/7/15.
The complainants may approach the legal forum after expiry of the above period.
It may be noted that the complainants have occupied their flat and got their possession later and the completion certificate from the municipality concerned has been obtained by the OP.
This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that the aforesaid proceedings are signed by all the complainants.
8.      It would thus be seen that an Occupancy Certificate had been obtained by the appellants and had been provided to the complainants by 23.07.2015 whereas the Consumer Complaints came to be instituted in the year 2016.  If the appellants were not required to obtain any certificate other than the Occupancy Certificate extracted hereinabove, the direction to the appellants to obtain the Completion Certificate and deliver the same to the complainants was not called for.  As far as the compensation and cost of litigation is concerned, it has come in the order of the State Commission that the possession of the allotted flat was to be delivered to the complainants by January 2013.  The possession however, came to be delivered much later.  It is not known when the Occupancy Certificates were made available by the appellants to the complainants though it appears from the proceedings recorded by the Assistant Director, Directorate of Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices that the same had been completed by 23.07.2015.  The notice of completion was given by the appellants to Dumdum Municipality only on 14.07.2014.  Therefore, there was a delay in obtaining the said Occupancy Certificate.
","9.      Considering the delay in obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and delivering possession of the allotted flats to the complainants, the direction for payment of compensation and the cost of litigation does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.  It is however, directed that in case the compensation and cost of litigation, as awarded by the State Commission, paid within six weeks from today, it shall not carry any interest.   The appeals stand disposed of.

1. The present Appeal is filed by the Appellants under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order dated 13.06.2017 passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No.32/2016.
2. The case of the Complainant/Respondent is that she entered into an agreement with the Opposite Party on 14.03.2008 for the development of her property. Her father Golak Nath Mukherjee was the owner of premises No.5, Gora Chand Lane, P.S. Shibpur within the local limits of Howrah Municipal Corporation, who died intestate leaving behind his widow Ava Rani Mukherjee and the Complainant. Ava Mukherjee passed away on 24.03.2013 and the Complainant became the absolute owner of the property. The Opposite Party- Developer was to make construction in Block-A for commercial purpose covering 12843 sq. ft. and Block-B covering 3804 sq. ft. Block-A of the building was to be completed within 24 months and Block-B to be completed within 10 months. The Opposite Party was to deliver 1033 sq. ft. in the first or second floor and a shop measuring 134 sq. ft. The Opposite Party not having delivered the same, the Complainant filed Complaint before the State Commission with following prayer: -
“i.       Opposite parties to forthwith deliver possession in respect of one shop room measuring about 134 square feet in the ground floor of block A and one flat measuring about 1033 square feet in 1st or 2nd floor in block A of the premises no.5 Gora Chand Roy lane, Howrah ward No.32 within the municipal limit of Howrah Municipal Corporation hereto favour of the petitioner.
ii.        Opposite Party be directed to obtain and make over completion certificate in respect of s hop rooms and flat as agreed to be provided.
iii.       Opposite party forthwith be  directed to make over the title deeds in respect of the properties description whereof is appearing in paragraph 17 hereof.
iv.         Opposite party be directed to pay interest and/or compensation in respect of the flat and shop rooms as indicated in paragraph 11 hereof.
v.         Cost of this application be assessed at Rs.10,000/- and respondent be directed to pay said sum together with further interest thereof.
vi.               Such further order or orders direction or directions be passed as your Honour may deem fit and proper.”
3. Having not filed the written statement within time, the Opposite Party was not permitted to file the same. However, it participated in the final hearing of the case.
4. After hearing both the parties and going through the material on record, the State Commission passed the following order: -
","“Accordingly, the petition of complaint is allowed on contest. The  OP is directed to deliver the possession in respect of one shop room measuring about 134 sq. ft. in the  ground floor of Block-‘A’ and one  flat measuring about 1033 sq. ft. in the 1st or 2nd floor in Block-‘A’ as per terms of the agreement within 60 days from the date of receipt of order. The opposite party is directed to make over the title deeds in respect of the properties to the complainant within 30 days.
The OP is also directed to make payment of compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- and litigation cost of Rs.10,000/- aggregating Rs.1,10,000/- within 30 days from the date, otherwise the amount shall carry interest @ 9% p.a. from the date till its full realization.”
5. Against the order of the State Commission, the Opposite Party has filed the present Appeal. Heard learned Counsel for the Appellant as well as the Respondent and carefully gone through the record. The Appellant/Opposite Party/Developer entered into an agreement with the Complainant on 14.03.2008. The owner’s allocation was 40% of the total area constructed and the developer’s allocation was 60% of the same. ‘A’ block was to be delivered within two years and B-Block within 10 months as per the agreement. Learned Counsel for the Appellant stated that the entire block-B was delivered and the only dispute was regarding the delivery of shop room measuring 134 sq. ft. and the flat measuring 1033 sq. ft., which have not yet been delivered.
6.           Having entered into an agreement with the Respondent way back in the year 2008 and not yet delivering 1033 sq. ft. of flat and 134 sq.ft. shop room, which ought to have been delivered within 10 months as per the agreement, is certainly a deficiency in service on the part of the Appellants and the State Commission has rightly ordered that the Appellant/Opposite Party could not fulfil his part of obligation and has caused harassment and mental agony to the Complainant and as such held the Complainant entitled to delivery of the above said premises and compensation.
6. For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any illegality or infirmity in the order of the State Commission.  There is no merit in the Appeal.  The order of the State Commission is confirmed and the Appeal is dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Abhishek Kumar, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1. The present Revision Petition is filed by the Petitioner under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Haryana   (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Appeal No. 488/2019 dated 05.07.2019.
2. In the Complaint Case, it was stated that the Respondent/Complainant was the registered owner of Escorts Tractor-Trolley bearing Registration No.  HR-01W-1557 and the same was insured with the Petitioner/Opposite Party, vide policy No. 35350231100100003257 (standard-commercial vehicle package policy valid from 16.07.2010 to 15.07.2011. Unfortunately, on 01.03.2011, the said tractor trolley met with an accident and got totally damaged. Intimation was given to the Petitioner stating all the facts that the car driver received fatal injuries in the said accident, the tractor trolley was taken in possession by the police and was released on superdari after a long delay. After getting the said tractor trolley released on superdari,  the Respondent  got the cost of repairs assessed from S.B. Trading Company and Jagdev Steel Works. The total estimated cost of repair was Rs. 6,23,207/-. The Respondent lodged the claim with the Petitioner but the claim was not settled. Hence, the Complaint was filed.
3. The Petitioner filed Written Statement in which it was stated that the Complaint was not maintainable as there is no relationship of consumer between the parties. Moreover, the Complainant does not come under the preview of the Consumer Protection Act since the alleged insured vehicle was admittedly being used for commercial purposes only. On merits, it was stated that the Respondent himself was responsible for non-payment of the claim as the Respondent failed to supply the estimate of repair, despite receipt of letter dated 20.06.2011, 24.08.2011, 02.11.2011 and 17.01.2011. He did not produce the tractor trolley for survey and never informed about the condition and fate of the tractor. Thus, under these circumstances, the Opposite Party had no option but to close the file as “No claim”. The earlier complaint was disposed of with the direction to the Respondent to submit the required documents. After going through the complete set of documents submitted by the Respondent and considering the claim again according to the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, the competent authority, repudiated the claim as the tractor was being used for commercial purposes, in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and in contravention of the Motor Vehicle Act, as the same was registered and insured only for agricultural purposes. The claim of the Respondent was again considered and repudiated in the light of investigation conducted by the investigator, who confirmed that at the time of the said alleged loss, the said tractor trolley was being used for business. Thus, there was no deficiency in service on the part of the Petitioner and prayed for the dismissal of the present Complaint.
4. District Forum, vide order dated 20.03.2019, allowed the Complaint and directed the Petitioner/Opposite Party to pay Rs. 2,85,000/- to the Respondent/Complainant  along with interest @7% per annum w.e.f. 16.05.2018 i.e. the date of repudiation of the claim till its realization, Rs. 5,000/- as compensation and Rs. 3,000 towards litigation expenses. The Petitioner/Opposite Party was further directed to comply with the order within the period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the certified copy of this order, failing which Opposite Party shall pay interest @9% per annum on the awarded amount, besides litigation cost for the period of default.
5. Being aggrieved of the order passed by the District Forum, the Petitioner filed an Appeal before the State Commission. State Commission, vide order dated 05.07.2019, dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner and confirmed the order passed by the District Forum. by the order of State Commission, Petitioner filed the Revision Petition before this Commission.
6.      Heard the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner. We have also carefully gone through the evidence placed on record. The Petitioner in his written statement contended that the Complaint is not maintainable as there is no relationship of consumer between the parties. The Respondent/Complainant does not come under the preview of Consumer Protection Act since the said vehicle is used for commercial purpose.
7.      The Respondent has insured the said vehicle with the Petitioner in order to indemnify the loss and such is a Consumer as per the Consumer Protection Act.  It has been held by this Commission in Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. I(2005) CPJ 27 (NC) decided on 03.12.2004 that since an insurance policy is taken for reimbursement or for indemnity for the loss which may suffer on account of insured perils, the services of the insurer cannot be said to have been hired or availed for a commercial purpose. This Commission, therefore, does possess the requisite jurisdiction to entertain a consumer complaint wherever a defect or deficiency in the services rendered by an insurer is made out. Thus, the Respondent/complainant can be said to be a consumer as defined in Section 2(1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act .
The tractor trolley was duly insured with the Opposite Party, from 16.07.2010 to 15.07.2011.  From the FIR dated 03.03.2011, it is apparent that the said tractor trolley met with an accident on 01.03.2011 during the period it was insured. The Opposite Party repudiated the claim of the Complainant vide letter dated 16.05.2018, on the ground that the tractor trolley was being used exclusively by the sons of the Complainant for business purpose in the Firm M/s Mangla Sales Enterprises. Even the Complainant failed to produce the tractor trolley for survey and assessment of the loss. In the repudiation letter it was stated that the Opposite party repudiated the claim after perusal of the documents and on the basis of investigation report. However, no investigation report has been placed on record by the Opposite Party. No other document has also been produced by the Opposite Party to prove that the tractor trolley was being used for  purposes other than agriculture. Thus, in the absence of any cogent and convincing evidence, the Opposite Party failed to prove that the tractor trolley was being used for commercial purposes. From a copy of the judgement dated 025 of the JMIC, Dera Bassi, it is apparent that the tractor trolley was taken possession by the police after the accident. The Opposite Party should have directed the surveyor/ investigator so appointed by it, to conduct the survey/investigation of the tractor trolley at the police station with the permission of police authorities and to assess the loss. Not doing so, the Opposite Party cannot blame the Respondent/Complainant for not producing the tractor trolley for survey. Taking all these facts and circumstances into consideration, we are of the view that the Opposite Party was not right in repudiating the claim of the Complainant and is liable to indemnify the Complainant for the loss suffered by him as per the policy.  As to the quantum of indemnification, the plea of the Complainant was that the insurance company was liable to pay repair charges of Rs.6,23,207/-, as assessed by S.D. Trading Corporation as it was a case of total loss. The plea of the Complainant that the Opposite Party was liable to indemnify to him to extent of Rs. 6,23,207/- is not tenable, as the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured more than the IDV of the vehicle. From a perusal of the policy documents, it is revealed that the IDV of the impugned tractor trolley was Rs. 2,85,000/-. The insurance company/Opposite Party is therefore liable to pay Rs. 2,85,000/- to the Complainant alongwith interest. The Opposite Party is liable to compensate the Complainant for the mental agony and physical harassment caused to him alongwith litigation expenses.
8.      This Commission under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has limited jurisdiction. It is not required to re-assess or re-appreciate the evidence and reach to its own independent conclusion, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. 2011(3) Scale 654 has held as under:
“Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21(b) of the Act, under which the said power cane be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums. The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same sets of facts. This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked. In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed. It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora”.
","9.      In view of the above, and there being no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order, the Revision Petition is dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The petitioner/complainant was running a cloth shop and had obtained an insurance policy for the period from 10.08.2001 to 09.08.2002 for a sum assured of Rs. 8,00,000/-.  A fire broke out in the shop of the complainant in the night of 30.03.2002.  Fire brigade was called to douse the fire and the police was also informed.  On being informed, the Insurer appointed a surveyor who assessed the loss to the complainant at Rs. 41505/-.  That amount was not acceptable to the complainant who approached the concerned District Forum  by way of a consumer complaint seeking payment of Rs. 4,10,000/- with compensation.
2.      Then complaint was resisted by the Insurer which, inter alia, stated in its reply that the surveyor had fairly and correctly assessed the loss of the complainant.  The District Forum vide its order dated 05.10.2005 directed the Insurer to pay a sum of Rs. 4,10,000/- to the complainant after deducting salvage.  Interest @ 9% p.a. was also awarded to the complainant.
3.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum the Insurer approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide its order dated 07.04.2011 the State Commission partly allowed the appeal and directed the Insurer to pay a sum of
Rs. 1,18,125/- to the complainant along-with interest @ 9% p.a. from the date of filing of the complaint till realization.
4.      Being still dissatisfied the petitioner/complainant is before this Commission.
5.      The learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant has submitted that the report of the surveyor was not accepted either by the District Forum or by the State Commission.  He has also stated that the account statements obtained by the surveyor would show that the complainant had stock of about Rs. 7,00,000/- in the shop.  The learned counsel has also pointed that that as per the intimation given by the bank to the surveyor the bank also inspected the shop of the complainant from time to time for checking the stock.
6.      A perusal of the survey report would show that no reliance can be placed upon the stock statements referred  by the learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant.  The stock statements are prepared by the borrower and not by the bank, though they are periodically submitted to the bank as a requirement of the bank while sanctioning the correct facility.  The report of the surveyor on page 67 of the paper book very clearly shows that the stock statements were not correct and seem to have been prepared only with a view to justify the claim.  It is noted by the surveyor that there was several anomalies in the stock statements.  I need not go into the details of anomalies which have been pointed out in detail for the period from March, 01 to March, 02 on internal page 8 of the survey report.
","7.      The surveyor noted that at the end of April, the stock shown was Rs. 7.11 lakhs, indicating increase to Rs. 0.17 lakhs from March, 2001 whereas purchase and sale in the intervening period were Rs. 0.48 lakhs and Rs. 1.56 lakhs respectively.  Therefore, the stock shown at the end of April, 2001 cannot be correct. Similarly, stock at the end of August, 2001 was shown at Rs. 6.86 lakhs whereas the closing stock of July, 2001 was Rs. 7.02 lakhs. The purchases during July were nil and the sale was Rs. 1.4 lakhs.  This again shows that the fudged stock statements were  given by the complainant.  The stock at the end of January, 2002 was shown as Rs. 6.96 lakhs whereas the closing stock of December, 2011 was Rs. 6.91 lakhs.  There was no purchase in the month of January and sale was Rs. 1.5 lakhs.  Thus the stock shown at the end of January, 2002 was highly inflated.  Therefore, no reliance can be placed on the stock statements which have been fudged by the complainant/petitioner. The order of the State Commission is based upon the photographs which show 225 burnt rolls and computing the price at Rs. 25/- per meter the State Commission arrived at a figure of Rs. 1,18,125/-.  The order passed by the State Commission has not been challenged  by the Insurance Company and, therefore, I need not go further on this aspect of the matter.  Suffice it would be to say that the compensation awarded by the State Commission does not call for any kind of enhancement by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  In fact, had the Insurer challenged the order of the State Commission there is a probability of even the consumer complaint being dismissed solely on the ground that fudged stock statements had been relied upon by the complainant.
8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove the Revision Petition is hereby dismissed.

1.       Vide this common order, I propose to dispose of complaint nos. 109  of 2015 and 1374 of 2015 since both the complaints relate to same project of the opposite party, namely, Parsavnath Privilege Project at Greater Noida which was launched in September, 2007.
2.       The brief facts of the case are that complainants in both the complaints are allotees of the flats in the said project and executed all the necessary documents including Flat-Buyer Agreement. The opposite party has not disputed these facts.  It is also not disputed that complainants in both the complaints had also paid consideration amount towards the construction of the subject flats and the possession was to be  handed over within 36 months from the date of commencement of the construction as per Clause 10 (a) of the agreement.  In complaint no. 109 of 2015,  the complainants had paid a sum of Rs. 50,65,738/- out of total consideration amount of Rs.52,86,750/- on different dates and in consumer complaint no. 1374 of 2015, the complainants had paid a sum of Rs.56,63,728/- out of total consideration of Rs.59,99,070/- on different dates.  This fact is also not disputed by the opposite party.
3.       It is the admitted fact on record that till date, the opposite party has not given the possession of the subject flats to the complainants and they have also failed to complete the construction within the stipulated period.
4.       The opposite party had contested the claim of the complainants in both the complaints and have taken the plea that complainants had claimed refund with interest @ 24% p.a. and it is contrary to the terms and conditions of the agreement.  They took the plea that delay had occurred due to recession in the real estate sector and this fact was communicated to the complainants herein.  It is claimed that there was no deficiency in service.
5.       The parties had led their evidences. I have heard the arguments and perused the relevant record.
6.       It is argued by the learned counsel for the complainants that it is a covered case passed by this Commission in Consumer Case No. 263 of 2015 titled Aditya Laroia Vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd., relating to the same project of the opposite party, since this Commission has held that opposite party had failed to give the possession of the flats to its allottees within the stipulated period, it was deficiency in service on their part and had ordered the refund of the entire deposited amount alongwith simple interest @ 18% per annum from the date on each payment till the date on which the said refund alongwith compensation in the form of such interest.  It is argued that this order was challenged by the opposite party before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 12815 of 2016 titled Parsvnath Developers Ltd. Vs. Aditya Laroia and there the opposite party had reached to a settlement with the complainant therein and decree passed by this Commission was deemed to  have been satisfied and with this observation, the appeal was dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  It is submitted that this shows that findings qua deficiency in service in relation to the said project has attained finality.  It is further submitted that two Member Bench of this Commission in Consumer Case No. 107 of 2015 titled Brig ( Retd.) Rakesh Dhir & Anr. Vs. M/s Parsvnath Developers Ltd. and other connected matters, which also relates to same project, has also held that failure to give possession within the stipulated period by the opposite party amounts to deficiency in service and passed the following order
","“For the reasons stated as above, as the Consumer Complaint No.107 of 2015 is taken as lead case, all the four Complaints i.e. C.C. No. 107 of 2015, C.C. No. 108 of 2015, C.C. No. 110 of 2015 and C.C. No. 1252 of 2015 are disposed of with a direction to the Opposite Party to refund the amount which each of the Complainants paid them along with simple interest @12% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund. The Opposite Party shall also pay Rs.25,000/- as cost of litigation to the Complainants in each case. Payments shall be made by the Opposite Party within 3 months from the date of this order.”
7.       It is prayed that similar order be passed in these complaints as well since it is a covered matter by previous pronouncement.
8.       Counsel for the opposite party has not disputed that these complaints are also covered by the judgement of this Commission  in Consumer Case No. 107 of 2015 titled Brig ( Retd.) Rakesh Dhir & Anr. Vs. M/s Parsvnath Developers Ltd. and other connected matters.  Even otherwise, admittedly till the filing of the complaints, opposite party has failed to give possession of the subject flats to the complainants herein.   This amounts to deficiency in service. The receipt of deposits by the complainants of the sum of Rs. 50,65,738 in consumer complaint no. 109 of 2015 and Rs.56,63,728/- in consumer complaint no. 1374 of 2015 is also  not disputed.
9.       In view of the above discussion, while allowing both the complaints, following directions are issued:
(i).     In Consumer Complaint No. 109 of 2015, the opposite party is directed to refund Rs.50,65,738/- ( Rupees Fifty Lakh Sixty Five Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty Eight only) alongwith simple interest @ 12% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund.
(ii).    In Consumer Complaint No. 1374 of 2015, the opposite party is directed to refund Rs.56,63,728/-( Rupees Fifty Six Lakh Sixty Three Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty Eight only) alongwith simple interest @ 12% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund.
(iii).   The opposite party shall pay Rs.25,000/- as cost of the litigation to the complainants of each complaint.
(iv).   The amount shall be paid within three months from the date of this order.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      The complainants/ respondents are farmers growing apple crop in District Uttarkashi of Uttarakhand.  The crop of the complainants was insured with the petitioner Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd.,  under a scheme framed by Government of India, which was also adopted by the State Governments.  Under the scheme, compensation in case of adverse weather incidence was payable in the farmers who were insured with the insurance company.
2.      The adverse incidence was the equivalent of the deviation between ‘Trigger Weather’ and ‘Actual Weather’ date recorded at a ‘Reference Weather Station’ during the specified time-period. In case of an adverse weather incidence for at least 5 days all the insured cultivators growing the notified crop in the reference units area were entitled to pay out the under scheme.
3.      The Government of Uttarakhand, while implementing the said scheme in the State, directed that though reference unit area will be treated as the basis to accept a risk and analyzing the compensation, if the estimates by reference weather stations are not available the estimates for those days by fixed Backup Weather Centres will be used.  It was further stipulated that it related figures of even the Backup Weather Stations are not available then the estimates for those days from nearby weather stations will be used with the consent of the horticulture department of Uttarakhand.
4.      The complainants who are covered under the insurance scheme of the petitioner company, lodged claims alleging excess rainfall in the area where apple crop was grown by them.  The claims having not being paid they approach the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.
5.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company, which inter alia, stated in its reply that there was no excess rainfall at least for five rainy days during the covered period i.e. from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014.
6.      The District Forum relying upon the data obtained by the complainant from HARC (Himalaya Action Research Centre), which is situated air distance of 200 meters and road distance of only about 1.5 km allowed the consumer complaints.
7.      Being aggrieved from order the passed by the District Forum the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. The said appeals having been dismissed the petitioner company is before this Commission.
8.      As noted earlier, the scheme framed by Government of India and implemented by Government of Uttarakhand envisaged pay out towards the compensation only if the adverse weather condition was recorded by the Reference Weather Station (RWS) of data for the relevant period was available from the RWS, the data from any other weather stations could not have been used for the purpose of claiming or making the payout.  Even the data from the Backup Weather Station could be used only in case the data for the relevant period was not available from the RWS.
9.      In the present cases the data from the RWS was actual available. A perusal of said data would show that during the period from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014 there was no excess rainfall for at least 5 days.  Therefore, relying upon the aforesaid data no compensation to the complainants became payable.
10.    The submission of the learned counsel for the complainant is that since the HARC is situated much nearer as compared to the RWS, the data provided by the HARC is bound to more reliable and should be used for the purpose of compensating the farmers particular when the object of the scheme is to compensate the farmers whose crops is affected on account of bad weather condition, including excess rainfall.  The submission, though attractive, cannot be accepted since it runs contrary to the specific terms of the insurance scheme under which the crop of the complainant was insured. The said scheme envisaged payout towards the compensation only if the data provided by RWS indicated excess rainfall, in case such a data was actually available for the relevant period.  The data of a weather station, other than the RWS cannot be used for claiming compensation in terms of the scheme even if the said weather station happens to be nearer then the RWS.
11.    This Commission is bound to decide the consumer complaint on the basis of the terms and condition of the insurance policy.  Since the said terms and conditions do not permit to use of data from a nearby weather station other than the RWS, unless neither the data from the RWS nor the data from Backup Weather Station is available, the fora below in my opinion could not have used of data of HARC for the purpose of compensating the complainants.
12.    In fact the issue involved in this petition is no more res integra in view of the decision of this Commission in Tirath Ram Thakur vs. Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. & Anr. Revision Petition No.3282-3283 of 2014 decided on 11.07.2017 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“14.    COMPENSATION (PAYOUT)
(I)      AIC shall be responsible for all Payouts arising out of “Adverse Weather Incidence” strictly in terms of the Scheme terms & conditions read with the relevant Premium & Payout tables.  However, this responsibility of AIC shall attach only when the ‘Risk has incepted’, that is, AIC has duly received the FULL PREMIUM, directly from the Insured his own part, AND ALSO the corresponding Premium Subsidy part from the Governments.
(II)     Pay-out shall arise ONLY in case of Adverse Weather Incidence.  Adverse Weather Incidence is equivalent to the deviation between “Trigger Weather” and “Actual Weather” Data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time-period.  Trigger Weather is a pre-defined Weather Parameter applicable to a Notified Crop in a notified Reference Unit Area.
In case of Adverse Weather Incidence (AWI), all the insured cultivators growing the Notified Crop in the Reference Unit Area shall be deemed to have suffered the same level of AWI and the same proportion of crop-loss, and become eligible for the same rate of Payouts.”                      (Emphasis added)
It is manifest from the highlighted portion of the Scheme, in para (II), that the Payout in case of Adverse Weather Incidence has to be determined on the basis of the data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time period.  On a pointed query, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner candidly admits that insofar as the Complainant’s Orchard is concerned, the relevant “Reference Weather Station” was Naggar and not Bahang.  That being so, we are unable to read any material irregularity or illegality in the impugned order, wherein the compensation payable to the Complainant has been determined on the basis of the weather data recorded at the said “Reference Weather Station”.
We are also unable to agree with the learned Counsel that the afore-noted stipulation in the Scheme is unfair to the Agriculturists.  The vires of the terms and conditions of a public policy cannot be examined in a Complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”
13.    The decision of this Commission in Revision Petition No.1654/2016 in  Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. Vs. Badri Singh Bisht & Anr. decided on 24.10.2016 also deals with this issue and to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“2.  It would thus be seen that the scheme was to be implemented on area approach basis wherein reference unit areas were to be notified for the purpose of insurance of the crop.  The reference unit areas were ordinarily to cover a radius of about 25 kms in case of rainfall and 100 kms in case of other weather parameters such as frost, heat, relative humidity etc.  Reference Weather Stations were also designated under the scheme for the purpose of providing weather data applicable to the area covered by a concerned reference unit area, for the purpose of calculation of compensation.  It is also evident that the compensation was to be paid strictly in terms of the aforesaid scheme and the computation of the compensation was dependent upon the weather in the reference unit area as per the data provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The actual loss if any suffered by the farmers had no bearing on the quantum of compensation payable under the scheme, and in case of abnormal weather, uniform compensation was payable to all the farmers in the affected area irrespective of the extent of their loss.
7.      As noted earlier, the computation of compensation in terms of the scheme was to be made on the basis of the data of the adverse weather provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The case of the petitioner is that Kashipur was the Reference Weather Station notified by the Government for Kotabag.  There is absolutely no evidence or even an allegation that a Reference Weather Station other than Kashipur had been notified by the State Commission for the area of Kotabag.  Therefore, there is reason to reject the case of the petitioner company that Kashmir was the concerned Reference Weather Station.  As far as Pantnagar is concerned, that was only a back-up station and the data at Pantnagar was to be considered only in the event of data not being available at Kashipur which was the designated Reference Weather Station for areas including Kotabag.  Therefore, the petitioner company was fully justified in computing the compensation on the basis of the data collected and provided by Kashipur Reference Weather Station.
8.      A perusal of the computation sheets filed by the petitioner company shows that the compensation was calculated as per the weather data provided by the Reference Weather Station at Kashipur.  Since the scheme envisaged payment of compensation computed solely on the basis of the data provided by the Reference Weather Station, the computation made and the compensation paid by the petitioner company to the complainants cannot be faulted with, even if the actual loss suffered by the complainant was substantially higher.  It can hardly be denied that the compensation paid to the complainants was very meagre and more or less nominal but, the scheme as framed by the Government, does not envisage payment of a higher compensation or a compensation based upon the actual loss suffered by the farmers.  Therefore, the direction for payment of compensation awarded by the District Forum cannot be sustained.”
14.    For the reasons stated above, the impugned orders cannot be sustained and same are hereby set aside.  The consumer complaints are consequently with no order as to costs.
15.    The amount which the petitioner company had deposited with this commission be refunded to it along with interest may have accrued on it.
","15.    The amount which the petitioner company had deposited with this commission be refunded to it along with interest may have accrued on it.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent applied to the appellant for allotment of a residential apartment in project namely “The Views” which the appellant was to develop at Mohali Hills, Sector 105 of Mohali paying a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- as the booking amount.  An allotment letter dated 14.04.2008 was issued to the complainant allotting unit No. H2-F03-303 for a consideration of Rs.44,32,619/-.  An agreement was executed between the parties on 29.05.2008 incorporating their respective obligations. As per the terms and conditions contained in the agreement the possession was to be delivered within 3 years of the allotment though a grace period of 90 days was also available for this purpose.  The possession, therefore, ought to have been offered to the complainant by 14.07.2011 including the grace period of three months.  The possession having not been offered to her the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking refund of the amount paid by her to the appellant.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the appellant company which admitted the allotment made to the complainant as well as the agreement executed with her.  The payment received from her was also not disputed.  It was inter alia stated in the written version that the possession was expected to be handed over to the complainant  by August, 2017.
3.      Vide impugned order dated 16.01.2017 the State Commission directed as under:-
To refund the amount Rs.38,14,424/-, to  the  complainant, alongwith interest @12% p.a. (as prayed for)  from the respective  dates  of  deposits onwards.
To pay compensation, in the sum of Rs.2 lacs, for causing mental agony and physical harassment, to the complainant.
To pay cost of litigation, to the tune of Rs.50,000/- to the  complainant.
The payment of awarded amounts mentioned at sr.nos.(i) to (iii), shall be made, within a period of 02 (two) months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order, failing which, the amount mentioned at sr.no.(i) shall carry penal interest @15% p.a., instead of @12% p.a., from the respective dates of deposits onwards, and interest @12% p.a., on the amounts mentioned at sr.nos.(ii) and (iii), from the date of filing of this complaint, till realization.
Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission the appellant is before this Commission.
4.      The Ld. counsel for the appellant submits that he is restricting his submission to the quantum of the interest awarded by the State Commission and is also disputing the lumpsum compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- in addition to the interest awarded by the State Commission.  He also submits that considering the recent decline in the rate of interest and the pandemic situation prevailing in the country, grant of interest @ 12% p.a. was not justified.
","5.      The Ld. counsel for the complainant states on instructions that in order to avoid further litigation in the matter the complainant is ready and willing to accept compensation in the form of simple interest @ 8% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date of refund.  In my opinion, the restricted prayer made by the Ld. counsel for the complainant is justified in the facts and circumstances of the case.  The impugned order is, therefore, modified by directing that the appellant shall refund the entire principal amount of Rs.38,14,424/- to the complainant along-with compensation in the form of simple interest @ 8% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date of refund.  The complainant will also be entitled to the cost of litigation awarded by the State Commission.  The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      Heard learned counsel for the revisionist and perused the material on record.
2.      In the interest of justice, and to settle the matter on merit, the delay of 17 days in filing the revision petition is condoned.
3.      The dispute relates to non- payment of the maturity amounts by the opposite parties, hereinafter referred to as the ‘finance corporation’, on the deposits made by the complainant with the finance corporation.
4.      Despite substituted service through publication, none appeared for the finance corporation before the District Forum. The District Forum heard the complainant, appraised the evidence and vide its Order dated 11.09.2012 allowed the complaint. We note in particular the following extracts from the District Forum’s Order:
On perusal of the case file, this fact is undisputed that the complainant deposited the amount of Rs. 5260/- in the Account No. 1076926, maturity date : 30.12.98, Amount: Rs. 6417/- , amount deposited Rs. 1,80,300/- in Account No. 1077203, Maturity date : 30.6.98 , amount : 20,1600/- , amount deposited of Rs. 45200/- in Account No. 1077055 , Maturity date : 15.4.99 , amount : Rs. 54144, amount deposited Rs. 1000/- in Account No. B 0191003, maturity date  : 30.12.98 , amount : Rs. 1200/-.
After considering upon all the case, we reach at this conclusion that the complainant is entitled to get the amount deposited in the Finance Company of the defendants with interest because the defendants have acquired benefit on the amount deposited by the complainant.
ORDER
Therefore, this District Consumer Forum directs to the defendants to pay the maturity amount of the Account No. 1076926 Rs. 6417.00, maturity amount of Rs. 20,1600.00 of the Account No. 1077203 , maturity amount of Rs. 54144.00 of the Account No. 1077055 , maturity amount of Rs.  1200.00 of the Account No. B- 0191003 with interest at the rate of 12 % per annum from the maturity date 30.12.98 , 30.06.98, 15.04.99,30.12.98 respectively, in addition to above , to pay Rs. 200.00 against costs of case. In the event of non – compliance of the Order, execution proceedings as per rules shall be carried out.
(as per the translated copy furnished by the petitioner)
(emphasis supplied)
5.      The manager of the finance corporation appealed in the State Commission. The State Commission heard both sides, appraised the evidence and through its Order dated 08.10.2015 dismissed the appeal. We note in particular the following extracts from the State Commission’s Order:
Shri. S.K. Verma, learned counsel on behalf of the appellant and Shri. V.S. Bisariya, learned counsel on behalf of the respondent are present. Heard the arguments of the learned counsel for both the parties. Perused the case file and Grounds of appeal.
It has been stated in the grounds of appeal that he was an employee, therefore, he has no accountability.
It is clear from the facts and circumstances of this case that there are no whereabouts of the above- named Finance Company and its employees connivingly and deceitfully have collected the amount and now state in this manner in the court that they were employee and they have no accountability, but no certificate (evidence) of the same has been filed.
","In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the Judgment/Order, which has been passed by the District Consumer Forum, has been passed in view of all the records and evidence. There is no need of making any interference in it. Appeal of the appellant is liable to be dismissed.
ORDER
Appeal of the appellant is dismissed.
Both the parties shall bear their own costs of the case.
(as per  the translated copy furnished by the petitioner)
(emphasis supplied)
6.      The manager of the finance corporation has filed the instant revision petition under section 21 (b) of the Act 1986 against the said Order dated 08.10.2015 of the State Commission.
7.      We find the impugned Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned. The State Commission has concurred with the findings of the District Forum.
8.      Even though the finance corporation chose to be ex parte before the District Forum, its manager appealed in the State Commission, the State Commission heard both sides, appraised the case, and as such the finance corporation got fair opportunity before the State Commission.
9.      Within the ambit and scope of section 21(b), we find no crucial error in appreciating the evidence by the two fora below, as may cause to require re-appreciation of the evidence in revision.
10.    We find the award made by the District Forum (quoted in para 4 above), and as upheld by the State Commission, to be just and equitable.
11.    On the face of it, we find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, as may require interference in the exercise of our revisional jurisdiction under section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
12.   The revision petition, being patently misconceived and totally bereft of merit, is dismissed.
13.   Needless to say that the District Forum shall undertake execution as per the law.
14.   A copy each of this Order be sent to the District Forum and to the complainant by the Registry within three days of its pronouncement.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents booked residential plots with the petitioner company in a project, namely, ‘TDI City’, which the petitioner company is developing in Kundli in Haryana. Allotment letters were issued to the complainants pursuant to the bookings made by them. The price of each plot was agreed at about 17 lakhs. The complainants were also required to pay External Development Charges in addition to the price of the plot. The said External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the allotments were made to the complainants. The allotment letters came to be issued to the complainants on 7.1.2006. The payment plan was incorporated in Schedule-1 annexed to the application whereby the bookings were made. The payment plan filed by the complainants is at variance with the payment plan filed by the petitioner company.  Neither the payment plan filed by the complainants is signed on behalf of the petitioner company nor is the payment plan filed by the petitioner signed by the complainants. However, as per both the payment plans referred hereinabove, 60% of the payment was to be made at the timed of booking.
2.      The case of the complainants is that since the payment plan annexed by the petitioner company to the allotment letters was different from the payment plan which they had agreed to, they wrote several letters to the petitioner to correct the payment plan, enable them to make payment accordingly, but no response to the said letters was forthcoming from the petitioner company.
3.      Vide letters dated 29.7.2010, the petitioner company informed the complainants that the plots were ready for possession and the complainants were requested to make payment as per the Statement of Account annexed to the said letter within 15 days. No reply to the said letter was given by the complainants nor did they make any payment in terms of the demand raised by the petitioner company. After sending reminder to the complainants, the allotments were cancelled vide letter dated 11.12.2010 on the ground that the complainants had not cleared the outstanding dues.
4.      On cancellation of the allotments, the complainants wrote letters dated 24.12.2010 to the petitioner seeking waiver of the interest on the ground that the petitioner had not sent the correct payment plan to them. The cancellation having not been revoked, the complainants approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints seeking possession of the allotted plots on payment only of the External Development Charges which the petitioner had earlier demanded from the complainants with interest and which the complainants had failed to pay. They disputed liability to pay any interest on the External Development Charges.
5.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company which took a preliminary objection that the District Forum did not have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the consumer complaints. On merits, the allotment made to the complainants as well as the payment received from them was admitted. It was, however, alleged that the complainants having defaulted in making payment of the balance sale consideration and External Development Charges, the allotments had rightly been cancelled.
6.      The District Forum vide its order dated 13.2.2013 directed the complainants to deposit the External Development Charges and also directed the petitioner to hand over the physical possession of the plots subject to the complainants paying the balance payment alongwith interest @ 9% p.a. from the due date till the date of payment.
7.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission  by way of separate appeals. The State Commission  having dismissed the appeals, the petitioner company is before this Commission. The order passed by the District Forum was not challenged by the complainants.
8.      The first submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner company is that the complainants are members of the same family, Shri Sukhmal Jain  being the father of Shri Dinesh Jain. She also submits that Shri Rajesh Jain brother of Mr. Dinesh Jain had also booked two plots in this very project and thus the family had booked six plots with the petitioner company in the same very project, two plots each having been booked by Shri Sukhmal Jain, Dinesh Jain and Rajesh Jain. She also submits that booking of as many as six plots by the members of the same family by itself would indicate that the bookings were made for speculative purposes and not for the purpose of constructing houses on the plots booked by them since the members of the same family were not likely to construct six different houses. Reliance is placed upon the decision of this Commission in Kavita Ahuja Vs. Shipra Estate Ltd. & Jai Krishna Estate Developers Pvt. Ltd. & Connected Matters CC No.137 of 2010, CC No.145 of 2010 and CC No. 146 of 2010, decided on 12.02.2015
9.      On a perusal of the written version, I find that no such plea was taken by the petitioner before the District Forum. In the absence of pleadings to this effect, the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner cannot be entertained though the said contention was raised before the Forum in the written arguments filed before the District Forum. However, the fact remains that this plea was not taken either in the written version or in the evidence filed before the District Forum. Had such a plea been taken in the written version, the complainants would have got an opportunity to explain as to why the family members had booked as many as six plots in the same project. It is not as if a family can never require six plots in the same project. In a given case, the family may be large enough to require six houses for the residence of its members. Unless an opportunity is given to the complainants to explain the bookings made by them, it would be difficult to hold that they were not consumers with the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the C.P. Act.
10.    As regards the pecuniary jurisdiction in terms of Section 11 of the C.P. Act, the District Forum had pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain a consumer complaint where the value of the goods  purchased or the services hired or availed as the case might be, did not exceed Rs.20 lakhs. In these matters, the basic price of the plot was less than Rs.20 lakhs in each allotment. Though the External Development Charges were payable in addition to the basic price of the plot, the quantum of the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the allotment was made and that is why the amount of the said charges was not mentioned in the allotment letters. As held  by a three-Members Bench of this Commission dated 7.10.2016 in CC No.97 of 2016 -  Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.,  the value of the services in such a case would mean the sale consideration agreed to be paid by the buyer to the seller. Since the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by the time the booking was made or even by the time the allotment letters were issued, it cannot be said that the complainants had agreed at the time of booking/allotment, to pay more than Rs.20 lakhs for each plot. The External Development Charges could eventually be less than the charges the petitioner has later claimed from the complainants. Had the EDC been substantially less, the aggregate of the Basic Sale Price and EDC would not have exceeded Rs.20 lacs. What has to be seen is that the definite consideration which the complainants had agreed to pay to the petitioner company at the time the booking / allotment was made in these matters.  Since the External Development Charges had not been ascertained by that time, it would be difficult to say that the complainants had to pay Rs.20 lakh each for each plot at the time the bookings/allotments were made. In any case, if two views in the matters are possible, the view which favours the complainants needs to be taken the provisions of the C.P. Act being primarily for protecting the interest of the consumer. In any case, this Commission, in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, will not be justified in interfering with the orders passed by the Fora below on this ground, in the facts and circumstances noted hereinabove since no failure of justice is shown to have happened on account of the consumer complaints having been entertained by the District Forum.
11.    Coming to the merits of the matters as noted earlier, two contradictory payment plans have been filed by the parties. The payment plan as noted earlier was Schedule-1 to the applications submitted by the complainants for booking the plots. The original applications were never produced by the petitioner before the District Forum though the petitioner was bound to be in its possession. Moreover, the conduct of the complainants in regularly writing to the petitioner and complaining of the change of the payment plan coupled with complete silence on the part of the petitioner in this regard clearly indicates that the payment plan filed by the complainants was correct and that is why the petitioner did not file the original applications before the District Forum nor did it controvert the letters received from the complainants in this regard.
12.    The booking was made by the complainants in August, 2005. The possession to the complainants was offered for the first time vide letter dated 29.7.2010, almost five years after the booking was made. Though even as per the payment plan relied upon by the complainants, 90% of the sale consideration was to be paid within one year of the allotment and admittedly there was default in making such payment, the complainants having not paid any amount after the initial payment constituting 60% of the basic sale price, the allotment was never cancelled by the petitioner which condoned the said default by offering possession of the allotted plots to the complainants on 29.7.2010. Moreover, the petitioner company never corrected the payment plan which it had annexed to the allotment letters though the said payment was different from the payment plan to which the complainants had agreed. Though the complainants did not make payment in terms of the letter dated 29.7.2010, the plots allotted to them are stated to be still available since this Commission vide its interim order dated 11.12.2013 had stayed the execution of the impugned order subject to the petitioner maintaining status quo in respect of the plots allotted  to the complainants. The District Forum has already directed payment of interest @ 9% p.a. on the balance sale consideration w.e.f. due date till the date of payment. Considering that (1) the petitioner itself had condoned the earlier default on the part of the complainants by offering possession to them as late as 29.7.2010 (2) the petitioner never came forward to correct the payment plan annexed to the allotment letters and (3) the possession came to be offered after as many as five years of the booking, the complainants in my opinion, should not be deprived of the possession of the allotted plots. The petitioner company has nothing to lose by delivering possession of the allotted plots to the complainants since it would be getting appropriate interest on the balance dues w.e.f. the date due date till the date of payment, in terms of the order passed by the District Forum and maintained by the State Commission. It would also be appropriate to note here that no compensation for the delay in offering possession has been awarded to the complainants, though the plots were offered after about five years.
","13.    It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Fora below were not justified in refusing interest on the amount of External Development Charges to the petitioner company. I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complainants having withheld the External Development Charges, they must pay interest on the said charges to the petitioner company, even if there was not specific agreement between the parties to pay interest on those charges. The complainants had agreed to pay the External Development Charges at the time the plots were booked by them. The said charges were not paid by them. Thus the amount of the External Development Charges was withheld and utilized by the complainants for their purposes. There is no good reason as to why they should not pay interest on the amount so withheld by them. The revision petitions are, therefore, disposed of in terms of the following directions:-
(i)      The External Development Charges as demanded by the petitioner company shall be paid to it by the complainants.
(ii)      In addition to the External Development Charges, the complainants shall also pay proportionate interest on the External Development Charges if such an interest was actually paid by the petitioner to the concerned authority. The amount of the proportionate interest shall be conveyed to the complainants within four weeks from today and shall be paid by them within eight weeks thereafter.
(iii)     The complainants shall also pay simple interest on External Development Charges @ 9% p.a. w.e.f. the date on which the said charges were paid by the petitioner to the Government till the date on which the charges are actually paid to the petitioner company.
(iv)    The balance principal amount shall be paid to the petitioner company in terms of the order passed by the Fora below.
(v)     The possession of the allotted plots shall be delivered to the complainants within four weeks of the complainants complying with this order.

3. It has been alleged in the petition that in the bulletin issued by Unit Trust of India, they were giving a very rosy picture of the units whereas the fact was that a Committee was already appointed to examine the affairs of the UTI which were in bad shape and the report of the Committee was also under consideration by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (in short ""JPC""). Ultimately, sale and repurchase of units was suspended in the year 2001. Thus, clearly the opposite party is guilty of unfair trade practice for attracting investments.
4. At the time of investments, the complainant was not knowing that the picture given in the bulletin is not true picture of the units as prices were not based on Net Asset Value (NAV) and were subjectively announced by the Board of UTI. Even when the complainant came to know that a JPC was already examining the affairs of UTI and they apprehended that prices of units may fall, they could not have withdrawn their amounts before three years which was minimum lock-in period for the units purchased if the benefit of exemption of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) was to be taken.
5. The complainant invested this amount in order to get additional benefit of Capital Gains Tax which was announced by the Government on purchase of units at that time. It has been claimed by the complainant that after year 2001 no dividends were received from the units and ultimately prices of units also fell down, therefore, the complainant had to repurchase the units at a loss. Accordingly, the following prayers have been made in the complaint:-
(i) The price charged at ₹71,00,00/- by the UTI and paid on the units be paid back by the UTI (successor to the Unit Trust of India as per ordinance no. 5 of 2002) and / or the Government of India to the complainant:-
(ii) The dividend promised by the Ex-Chairman of the UTI Mr.Subramaniam at 20% for the year 2002 and 2003 be paid at ₹14,20,000/- to the company by the administrator and successor to the UTI and/or Government of India.
(iii)   That our business has come to stand still and has suffered losses due to the closure of the factory and mental agony suffered by the company and loss of reputation ₹10,00,000/- be paid to the company.

(ii) To direct the first respondent, UTI to allot to the complainant a total number of 68,84,681.583 units at the rate of ₹5.81 per unit covering a total sum of 4 crores which the complainant had originally invested in May and June 1999 w.e.f. May and June 1999;
(iii) To direct the first respondent, UTI to recalculate the dividend payable on the units on the assumption that the complainant was holding 68,84,681.583 units from May and June 1999 and to pay the dividend to the complainant at the rate at which it was being declared from time to time till then; and
(iv) To direct the first opposite party, UTI to repurchase the said 68,84,681.583 units at the present Net Asset Value;
Or in the alternative
(v) To direct the first opposite party, UTI to repurchase the units held by the complainant at the rate at which it was being repurchased when the complainant had originally invested in the same in May and June 1999, namely @₹14.80 and ₹15.00 per unit
(vi) to direct the first opposite party, UTI t pay the complainant the dividends due thereon at the rate at which dividends were being paid at the time of complainant made the investments or interest thereon @ 18% per annum till realisation; and
And
C. to direct the opposite party to pay a sum of ₹10 lacs as compensation of the mental agony and stress suffered by the complainant herein.
D. To award the actual amounts spent by the complainant towards cost of the litigation by way Advocate’s fee and other connected expenses for which the complainant may be given time to produce the receipts; .

10.   All the parties have filed their respective evidence by way of affidavits which have been taken on record.
11.   Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused record. The learned counsel for the parties are common in both the complaint cases for respective parties.
12.   The learned counsel for the complainants stated that there is no merit in the argument of the opposite party that the present cases involved complicated questions of facts and law, therefore, matter should be relegated to civil court. In this regard, the learned counsel referred to the following judgments:
(i)  Dr. J.J. Merchat & Ors. Vs. Shri Chaturvedi Nath : (2002) 6 SCC 635
(ii) CCI Chambers Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. Vs. Development Credit Bank Ltd : AIR 2004 SC 184
13. On the basis of above judgments, the learned counsel for the complainants stated that even the complicated questions of facts and law can be decided in summary procedure and the same should be so decided. This Commission is best equipped to decide the cases of unfair trade practice which is the main allegation in the present complaints.
14. The learned counsel for the complainants has alleged that there was internal bungling within UTI and when the complainants repurchased units, they suffered great loss and the complainant in O.P. No. 95 of 2003 only received ₹77,47,850/- for investment of total sum of ₹71 lacs after a period of approximately five years. Sale of unit was made attractive by giving exemption under CGT, however, the UTI knew that prices of units will fall after few years and therefore, this offer was made to befool the investors. Even if the savings in CGT is taken into consideration, as has been estimated by OP-1, the gain comes to roughly 4% per annum only. Every year there was increase in the unit prices and the dividend was also paid, however, the position changed from year 2001 and the price of units fell sharply and the complainants suffered huge losses when they repurchased the units for coming out of the scheme.
15. The learned counsel for the complainants argued that units were not sold on the basis of Net Assess Value (NAV). Sale price of the unit was kept artificially high though it was not supported by the actual net worth of the units. The learned counsel further alleged that there was lot of irregularities in the UTI and to examine these aspects, Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) was constituted and on whose recommendation, finally UTI Act was repealed and option was given to the unit holders to repurchase the units at value which was much less than ₹10/- or to get US-64 bonds in lieu of units. In respect of distribution of dividends, the JPC in ‘Chapter XIX’ titled ""Role of Trustees"" has observed the following:-
""19.2 xxxxxxxx. It has also observed that, ""Raising the dividend yield on 1996-97 and 1997-98 as compared with 1995-96 was, in retrospect, not a prudent step and not justified by the results of the scheme."" It has also stated, ""It is pertinent to note that, during 1997-98, a significant change in the accounting policy was effected. During the year, the investment portfolio depreciated sharply by Rs.3,566.04 crore, which was charged to the ‘reserves and surplus’ account, unlike in early years when depreciation, if any, was charged to the ‘Revenue Account’. As a sequel to this significant change in accounting policy, ‘reserves and surplus’ as at the end of June 1998, tuned negative at Rs.1098.49 crore. Had this accounting practice not been following, net income would have been zero"". The Tarapore Committee has also commented that in a non-NAV based scheme like US-64 a certain level of prudential reserves should have been maintained to meet redemption pressures which was not done in all these years.""
16. The learned counsel for the complainants also argued that the provision of section 37 of the UTI Act will not be applicable in the present case because the UTI has not taken actions in good faith. Absence of good faith is very much clear from the fact that the Joint Parliamentary Committee has found various irregularities and unhealthy practices prevalent in the UTI. Government was reporting action taken reports to the Parliament. Even some of the officials of the UTI were sent to jail including the Chairman. All these facts clearly imply that everything was not done in good faith in the UTI. Even the inside trading has been alleged which is a recognized evil of the corporate world.
17. On the other hand, learned counsel for the opposite party no. 1 stated that all the investments in the scheme are subject to market risks and the NAV of schemes/ plans may go up or down depending upon the factors and forces affecting securities market. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of the future. There can be no assurance that the objective of the scheme will be achieved. ""US-64"" is only the name of the scheme and does not in any manner indicate either the quality of the scheme, its future prospects or returns.
18. The learned counsel for OP further stated that the complainants are not ‘consumer’ within purview of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as they purchased US-64 units for earning profits i.e. for commercial purpose. Learned counsel further stated that the present grievance of the complainants apart from being not based on any legal rights is outside the jurisdiction of this Commission. Learned counsel further stated that the issues involved in the present complaints cannot be settled without leading detailed evidence and production of witnesses, hence, proper forum for adjudication of the present complaints would be civil court.
19. The learned counsel for OP-1 has clarified various aspects of UTI ""US-64"" units sale and repurchase from year 1999 in their affidavit dated 20.12.2018, wherein the following has been averred:
A.  In this regard, I state that, while announcing various schemes, the Unit Trust of India had made it clear that NAV was not applicable to US-64, which is evident from very first item in Annexures 8, 9 and 10 to the complaint, however, the same was applicable to many other schemes floated by the Unit Trust of India.
B.  It is submitted that other investors who had purchased the units in the months of April-May, 1999 and opted for re-purchase at any time during the period other than period of suspension of Sale and Repurchase in 2001- had all received expected returns.
C.  Purchase and repurchase price of units of US-64 are only available till May 2001, as US-64 scheme was foreclosed thereafter and no sale or repurchase of units was allowed by Unit Trust of India. Finally, Administrator of the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India decided to foreclose the scheme as on 31st May 2003.
D.  In this regard, I state that, until May, 2001 the units of US-64 scheme were offered for sale and redemption at administered price decided and fixed by Board of Trustees of the Unit Trust of India based on several factors such as returns on units vis-a-vis other competing medium of savings, the flow of funds, possible repurchase etc. I state that the same factors were applied by the Unit Trust of India for past several years.
E.  I say that Deepak Parekh Committee in its report has recommended to apply Net Asset Value (NAV) based price instead of administered price of Unit under US-64 in due course. This report was submitted on 25th February 1999 in the Parliament and was made available to public by Unit Trust of India in the month of May 1999. I further state that the Unit Trust of India had initiated the process to implement the said report and as consequence thereto, a decision was taken in the month of July 2001 to suspend the sale and repurchase of US 64 for a period of six months to enable it to restructure the scheme and make the same NAV based.
F.  Price of units, acquired in the secondary market after 1st July 2001 or units allotted out of income distribution on or after 1st July 2001 or fresh units purchased after 1 January 2002, were fixed based on NAV in compliance with SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulation 1996 called ""US 2002"".
G.  Notwithstanding, the Unit Trust of India in consultation with Govt. of India devised a ""Special Limited Repurchase, as on June 30, 2001, by providing facility of Repurchase upto 3000 units at any time from August, 2001 to 31 May, 2003 at prices indicated therein or the NAV whichever was higher. This package was modified with effect from 01 January, 2002 increasing the limit for limited repurchase facility from 3000 units to 5000 units. The Unit Trust of India in January, 2003 announced conversion of units of US 64 scheme into 5 year tax-free tradable bonds with effect from 14 June 2003 carrying 6.75% p.a. interest payable half-yearly. In addition, units of US-64 Scheme , issued on or before 30 June, 2001 either held by the original unit holders or by the buyers of these units in the secondary market were made eligible for five year tax-free tradable bonds with effect from 1 June, 2003 maturing on 31 May, 2008 and bonds were issued to such unit holders, who opted for conversion of units.""
20. Learned counsel for the opposite party further stated that in sub-clause (f) of section 21 procedure is laid down for determining issue of repurchase price of units by Board. The Board has powers to amend even section 1 which relates to fixing the price of sale and repurchase of the unit. Thus, there is no irregularity or illegality if UTI Board determines the price of repurchase not in accordance with earlier procedure but differently. Clearly, UTI Board accepted recommendation of the Joint Parliamentary Committee and accepted the determination of sale and repurchase price of units on the basis of NAV which was not the earlier procedure.
","21. Learned counsel for the opposite party referred to a judgment of the Hon’ble High Court of judicature at Patna in Jan Chokidar (Peoples Watch), through its Convener Basant Kumar Choudhary & anr. Vs. Union of India, CWJC No.4394 of 2004, decided on 5.12.2008, where a public interest litigation has been dismissed by observing the following:-
""10. It needs no emphasis that in the matters of commerce and investment, market decisions are based on market positions and such decisions are not amenable to judicial review. Be that as it may, we find that authorities concerned have taken all necessary actions concerning the scam highlighted by the petitioners and that Actions Taken Reports pursuant to the reports submitted by the JPC are being submitted to the Parliament from time to time, Court’s intervention in the matter is not at all called for.""
22. Learned counsel for the opposite party further pointed out that as per section 37 of the UTI Act, jurisdiction of courts is barred, therefore, the present complaints are not maintainable under the eyes of law before this Commission.
Section 37 of the UTI Act, reads as under:-
""37. Protection of action taken under this Act. – No suit or other legal proceeding shall lie against the Trust or a[the Reserve Bank or the Development Bank] or any trustee or any officer or other employee of the Trust or a[the Reserve Bank or the Development Bank] or any other person authorised by the Trust to discharge any functions under this Act for any damage caused or likely to be caused by anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Act.""
23. I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and examined the record. So far as the objection of the opposite party in respect of complainants not being a consumer is concerned, it is seen that the complainants have purchased the units by paying due consideration to the opposite party. Any financial service is covered under section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. This Commission in Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. CTJ 141 (CP) has observed the following:
""18. Further, what is commercial purpose is discussed by the Apex Court in various decisions.
19. We would refer to few relevant judgments:
In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Vs. Shiv Kumar Joshi, (2000) 1 SCC 98, the Court elaborately considered the provisions of Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(o) as well as earlier decisions and held that-
""The combined reading of the definitions of ""consumer"" and ""service"" under the Act and looking at the aims and object for which the Act was enacted, it is imperative that the words ""consumer"" and ""service"" as defined under the Act should be construed to comprehend consumer and services of commercial and trade-oriented nature only. Thus any person who is found to have hired services for consideration shall be deemed to be a consumer notwithstanding that the services were in connection with any goods or their user. Such services may be for any connected commercial activity and may also relate to the services as indicated in Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.""
21. The aforesaid ratio makes it abundantly clear that services may be for any connected commercial activity, yet it would be within the purview of the Act.
24. From the above observation of this Commission, it is clear that purchase of units of US 64 would be covered under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. The concept of commercial purpose has stabilized by now and it would have been commercial purpose, had the purchasers been selling these units for some extra payments to some other persons, but the units have been directly purchased by the complainants and also repurchased directly by the opposite party. Thus, clearly the complainants are consumers within the definition given in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986.
25. On merits, there are two strong contentions of the learned counsel for the opposite party. The first one is that units are linked to market forces and no definite return can be expected or predicted under the scheme and past performance is no indication for the future performance of the scheme. The second important assertion of the learned counsel for the opposite party is that under section 37 of the UTI Act, no suit or legal proceedings can be instituted against the UTI.
26. Coming to the first issue of market risk, it has been admitted by the opposite party that for the relevant period of purchase in these two complaints, the price of unit was not linked to NAV and consequently not directly linked to the market forces rather, it was administered price by the Board of Trustees of the UTI. Had it been on the basis of the NAV, then it could have been said that the price of unit was market linked. Moreover, when exemption of capital gains tax was linked to the purchase of the units, there can be no question of its price being based on the market risks. Thus, in fact, the investments in the UTI were not subject to market risk to that extent as in mutual funds or other related securities. Thus, a purchaser of US 64 units may expect a reasonable return from the scheme based on the past performance to some extent.
27. Now, coming to the issue of section 37 of the UTI Act, it is seen that this section provides that any suit or legal proceedings would not be maintainable against UTI and/or its officers for any damage caused by anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of the Act. Looking at the various observations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee sample of which is already quoted in one of the preceding paragraphs, one can guess that the activities undertaken by the Trust and actions taken by the officials of the Trust may not be under the good faith. In the case Jan Chokidar (Peoples Watch), through its Convener Basant Kumar Choudhary & anr. Vs. Union of India (supra) the Hon’ble High Court has taken note of various action taken reports submitted to the Parliament as follows:
""6. The joint Parliamentary Committee recommended in its report that Unit Trust of India should conduct a review of instances of investments going into default within a short period of sanction indicting possible deficiencies in the investment decision making process. The Government was also asked to present its Action Taken Report within six months of the presentation of the reports and further reports of progress of Action Taken until action on all recommendations were fully implemented to the satisfaction of the Parliament. The Government submitted to the Parliament first Action Taken Report on 9th May, 2003 and subsequent ATRs are said to have been submitted from time to time. From the affidavit filed by the Central Government, it is apparent that instructions have been issued that wherever instances of irregularities on the part of Unit Trust of India Officials come to the notice of the Government, necessary action be taken. The details of some of these actions as set out in the affidavit are thus:-
""(a) In July 2001, Government of India appointed a committee under the Chairmanship of Shri S.S.Tarapore (Tarapore Committee) to enquire into activities of UTI to inter-alia, ascertain whether investment/disinvestments decisions taken by UTI and in particular in the US-64 schemes in the last ten years were based on commercial or extraneous considerations. The committee identified 89 companies and out of those 89, scrutinized UTI’s investment in 19 companies. The JPC recommended a thorough enquiry of the secondary market transactions of UTI in the shares of these 89 companies. The Government has already handed over these cases to SEBI for investigation and SEBI has already initiated enquiry. If on the basis of the SEBI report, any instance of criminal negligence of UTI officials comes to the notice of the Government further action regarding filing of FIR with the local police or with CBI will be taken, depending on the nature and severness of the criminality involved.
(b) Altogether seven cases have already been registered by CBI and above cases are under investigation. A list of Cases under investigation by the CBI is attached as Annexure ‘Á’.
(c) In addition, in the matter relating to the financing of Sh. H C Biyani, broker at Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) by Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd. (SHCIL) under their Sell-n-Cash scheme, on the basis of a complaint from CSE, Kolkata Police have registered a case and the matter is under.""
28. Though none of the parties have filed information in respect of the final action taken either by SEBI or by the Government in the matter, however, from the above, it is clear that the Government also apprehended that everything was not alright in the UTI and there were certain acts or omissions which required inquiry and action against the responsible persons.
29. Thus, it can be very well seen that everything in the UTI was not normal and there were various activities and decisions taken by the Trust which may have been beyond good faith.
30. Now I will examine the issue of unfair trade practice. On the one hand, the deficiencies and other irregularities in the UTI had already come to the fore and they were under scrutiny of Tarapore Committee as well as by the Joint Parliamentary Committee, but on the other hand, still the UTI was showing its bulletins normally and giving the previous results for US 64 scheme and the administered prices for their sale and repurchase till the year 2000. This gave a picture to the investors that the position of the UTI was very robust and their investments would be safe. Thus, the bulletins issued in the year 2000 and 2001 were not the true representation of the real financial position and results and other activities of the Trust. This can be seen as unfair trade practice as defined under Section 2(1)(r)(1)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 which reads as under:
2(1) (r). ""unfair trade practice"" means a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice including any of the following practices, namely:-
(1)(ii), falsely represents that the services are of a particular standards, quality or grade;""
31. Moreover the issue of lock-in period of 3 years for the benefit of capital gains tax is more important from the point of view of unfair trade practice. The opposite party gave benefit of exemption of capital gains tax if units were purchased, however, the condition was that the purchaser should remain invested for at least three years. This is a form of unfair trade practice as defined in Section 2(1)(r)(3)(a) which reads as under:
"" (3) (a) Permits-
(a) the offering of gifts, prizes or other items with the intention of not providing them as offered or creating impression that something is being given or offered free of charge when it is fully or partly covered by the amount charged in the transaction as a whole;""
32. Thus, on the one hand, the opposite parties are claiming the scheme to be governed by market forces, but on the other hand, the opposite parties have clamped the scheme for 3 years for the complainants and the complainants cannot take any advantage from market forces. As has been seen above that the scheme was not really linked to market forces, rather, the sale and repurchase prices were administered by the Trust, particularly the complainant who invested in the year 1999 had to remain invested till 2002 though the scheme itself was suspended from May 2001 and ultimately foreclosed finally in the year 2003 and such complainant could not reap the benefit of the scheme for the full lock-in period of 3 years. Due to the lock-in period of 3 years, the complainant could not take advantage of the market forces and could not come out of the scheme when he so desired and had to remain invested compulsorily under the scheme though the scheme itself did not continue for 3 years. No such condition was mentioned in the bulletin in the year 1999 when the complainant made the investment. It was expected that the scheme will continue for 3 years and the purchaser will get the normal dividend and ultimately the repurchase price. It cannot be argued that the scheme was suspended in May 2001 and finally foreclosed in the year 2003 due to directions of the Parliamentary Committee or of the Government, because, from the point of view of the purchaser of units, this is purely unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party because the scheme was contracted for 3 years but the scheme was suspended midway and finally foreclosed and converted into a new scheme which was not as profitable as the main scheme.
33. For the purchaser of units in 1997, this would not make much of a difference because it was open to the purchaser that he could have withdrawn from the scheme before the scheme was foreclosed because 3 years were completed in the year 2000 which was before the foreclosure of the scheme in May 2001. This investor has invested only rupees 1 lakh in the year 1999 and therefore the unfair trade practice as examined above applies only on rupees 1 lakh for this investor.
34. Based on the above discussion, it is seen that in OP No. 358 of 2002, the units were purchased in the year 1999 and therefore the complainant is affected by the unfair trade practice adopted by the opposite party by foreclosing the scheme within the lock-in period of 3 years. Clearly for an unfair trade practice, it cannot be said that the unfair trade practice has been adopted on good faith. Therefore, The allegation of unfair trade practice as proved above will be outside the purview of section 37 of the UTI Act.
35. As regards the compensation for this unfair trade practice, it is seen that the complainant has not received the dividend for the year 2002 though he was to remain invested due to the condition of lock-in period of 3 years. It is seen that the complainant has received Rs.97,70,596/- as dividend from 1999 to 2001. Clearly the dividend for the year 2002 cannot be given at this rate because by that time, the markets had collapsed and valuation of the units on NAV basis had fallen heavily. In these circumstances, I deem it appropriate to award Rs.8 lacs to the complainant as compensation for the unfair trade practice adopted by the opposite party.
36. Coming to the OP No. 95 of 2003, it is seen that in this case the US 64 units of rupees 70 lakhs have been purchased in the year 1997 and units for rupees one lac have been purchased in the year 1999. Clearly for the units purchased in the year 1997, the complainant had sufficient time to offer units for repurchase after the lock-in period of 3 years. The unfair trade practice will only be applicable on the purchase of Rs. 1 lakh which was done in the year 1999. The complainant can be entitled to a compensation of Rs. 5000/- only.
37. Thus, based on the above discussion, the OPs are allowed as under:
OP No. 95 of 2003
The opposite party UTI is directed to pay Rs. 5,000/- (rupees five thousand only) along with interest @6% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint till actual payment to the complainant as well as Rs.10,000/- as cost of litigation within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.
OP No.358 of 2002
The opposite party UTI is directed to pay Rs.8,00,000/-( rupees eight lacs only) along with interest @6% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint till actual payment to the complainant along with Rs.10,000/- as cost of litigation within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

","R.K. AGRAWAL, J., PRESIDENT
M/s. Dujodwala Products Ltd., Raigad (hereinafter referred to as the Complainant) has filed the present Revision Petition under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), against the Impugned Order dated 04.09.2018 passed by the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as State Commission) in Appeal No. A/15/313, whereby the State Commission had allowed the Appeal filed by the National Insurance Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Opposite Party Insurance Company) and had set aside the Order dated 14.10.2014 passed by the Raigad District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Alibagh (hereinafter referred to as the District Forum) and dismissed the Complaint filed by M/s. Dujodwala Products Ltd., the Complainant.
Brief facts as narrated in the Complaint are that the Complainant Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing of Chemicals, having their factory at Kumbhivali, Taluka-Khalapur, Dist. Raigad. The Complainant Company sells their products within and outside India. The Complainant Company was required to supply their products to M/s. Saudi Rook Wool Factory at Riyadh. As the product was sensitive in nature and the temperature was required to be maintained at 5oC or less to save the product from damage, they hired a Container bearing No.MWCU6037091, having inbuilt refrigeration system from M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. The products were packed in 109 metal drums and were stuffed in the Container and then the Container was loaded on a motor vehicle for taking the same to JNPT, Nhava Sheva on 14.10.2006 for onward transportation to Riyadh. The Complainant had insured that Container with Opposite Party Insurance Company by obtaining Insurance Policy No. 26500/21/06/4600000/647 covering all risks. Before the products were packed in the Container, temperature of the Container was checked and found that it was at the requisite level. On 18.10.2006 at about 12.38 p.m. the Complainant Company received message from M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. informing that the Container could not be shipped Overseas as the Container did not maintain requisite temperature due to technical problem in the refrigeration system. Complainant had taken immediate action as the products were sensitive to temperature and they had brought back the Container to their factory on 19.10.2006. Due to rising of temperature in Container, quality of products suffered.The Complainant Company lodged Insurance claim with Opposite Party Insurance Company for getting the cost of the Products. The Opposite Party Insurance Company deputed M/s. A & Shaikh Co. (hereinafter referred to as Surveyor) to assess the loss.The Surveyor verified the Container by visiting factory on 19.10.2006 and assessed the loss to the tune of ₹12,22,869/- after deducting 5% of total value of the products towards salvage value. However, the Opposite Party Insurance Company vide letter dated 26.12.2006 repudiated the Claim on the ground that the damage to the Products was caused due to change in temperature because of improper packing which resulted into change in temperature and the same was not covered under the Policy. Alleging deficiency in service on the part of the Opposite Party Insurance Company, the Complainant Company filed a Consumer Complaint before the District Forum seeking the following reliefs:-
“a)      The Opponent may please be ordered to pay the Complainant a sum of ₹12,94,731/- alongwith the interest at the rate of 13% and including notice charges of ₹1500/- and other expenses, as the Hon. Court may deem fit.
b)        The Opponent may please be ordered to pay the Complainant a sum of ₹1,00,000/- being damages and compensation for hardship, harassment and mental agony.
c)        And cost of proceedings”
The Opposite Party Insurance Company contested the claim by filing their Written Version. They took a preliminary objection that the cause of action had arisen on 18.10.2006 when the product was destroyed due to rising of temperature. However, Complaint has not filed within two years from the same.The Container was provided by M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd., which is a necessary Party and they have not been made a Party in this Complaint, therefore, the Complaint is liable to be dismissed for non-joinder of the Party.They submitted that during the transport of Container neither any accident had taken place nor any damage was caused to the Container. It was submitted that due to defective packing of the goods in the Container the refrigeration system failed and the temperature in the container increased resulting in damage to the goods. They submitted that the Products kept in the Container were required to be kept at a temperature below 5ºC. For that purpose, there was inbuilt refrigeration system in the Container. The Container was supplied by M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. and the Products kept in the Container were damaged due to failure of refrigeration system of the Container. The Opposite Party has no concern with the same and this part has been specifically excluded in the Insurance Policy. They also submitted that the Container was insured covering all the risks which may occur during transport of the Container but any loss caused due to change in temperature due to failure of the refrigeration system is not covered in the Policy. They were, therefore, not liable to pay Insurance Claim to the Complainant. There is no deficiency in service on their part.They prayed that the Consumer Complaint be dismissed.
After hearing the learned Counsel for the Complainant and Opposite Party Insurance Company, perusing the pleadings and evidence on record, the District Forum had held as under:-
“No convincing evidence brought on record by the Opposite Party to support its case that due to defective packing of the goods in the Container the refrigeration system failed and the temperature in the container increased causing damage to the goods.  The evidence tendered by the complainant is not rebutted and therefore, the case tried to be made out by the Opposite Party cannot be accepted.  If the insurance policy referred to above is minutely perused, it is seen that it covers all risks.  In our opinion the damage caused to the goods of the Complainant in a manner stated is also covered under the said policy and the Opposite Party cannot take benefit of exclusion clause 2.3 thereof.
It is established by the evidence tendered by the Complainant that the loss caused to its goods is covered under the above mentioned Insurance Policy and the Opposite Party is liable to compensate the loss. In spite of this the Opposite Party repudiated the claim of the Complainant under the exclusion clause 2.3 of the Policy which in our opinion is deficiency in service on the part of the Opposite Party. The Complainant is therefore, entitled to entire damage from the Opposite Party. After having considered the material on record we arrived at the conclusion that there is deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party and hence the complainant is entitled to relief claimed.
FINAL ORDER
1.    Complaint No. 143/08 is allowed.
2.    It is hereby declared that there is deficiency in service rendered by the opposite party to the Complainant.
3.    The Opposite Party shall pay to the Complainant a sum of ₹12,94,731/- (Rupees Twelve Lakh Ninety Four Thousand Seven Hundred thirty one only) towards loss with interest @12% p.a. from the date of filing the Complaint, i.e., 10.02.2008 till realization.
4.    The Opposite Party shall also pay to the Complainant ₹50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) towards compensation and ₹5,000/- (Rupees Five thousand only) towards cost of the proceedings.”
Aggrieved by the Order dated 14.10.2014 passed by the District Forum, the Opposite Party Insurance Company preferred an Appeal before the State Commission.
The Opposite Party Insurance Company submitted before the State Commission that the damage to the Product kept in the Container was caused only because the temperature of the Container could not be maintained at 5oC or below due to defect in refrigeration system and the Container with inbuilt refrigeration system was provided by M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. The refrigeration system of the Container and work of keeping the temperature of the Container below 5OC was strictly with M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. and Opposite Party Insurance Company has no concern with the same.It was further submitted that damage was not caused due to accident to the vehicle or damage to the Container. All risks in respect of transportation of Container was covered in the Insurance Policy but damage to the products due to failure of refrigeration system was certainly not included in the Insurance Policy.The Opposite Party Insurance Company relied upon judgment passed by this Commission in “New India Assurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Deepak Anand, reported in III (2014) CPJ 373 (NC)]” and “Future Generali India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Micron Precision Screws Ltd. reported in II (2015) CPJ 88 (NC)].”
After hearing the learned Counsel for the parties and perusal of material on record and the judgments relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, the State Commission had allowed the Appeal by observing as under:-
","“We are of the opinion that opponent cannot have any concern about the same and cannot be held responsible for the same although in Insurance Policy it has been mentioned that they are covering all the risks. It means the risk covered is in respect of transport of container and not about technical problem of refrigeration system of container. On perusal of terms and conditions, it has become clear that if loss or damage was caused due to packing then the same was not covered under the insurance policy and specifically excluded from the policy. We are of the opinion that as packing of product in the container was not proper, it affected the refrigeration system of the container to maintain temperature of container below 5 ºC. Hence, it is strictly between complainant and M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd. who supplied container to the complainant and opponent cannot be held responsible for the same. In view of rulings on which the Learned Advocate for appellant has relied it has become clear that when it is specifically excluded from the insurance policy, Insurance Company cannot be held liable to pay insurance claim to the complainant. Hence, we are of the opinion that the Learned District Forum had not considered this fact properly and had wrongly come to conclusion that opponent has given deficiency in service to complainant by not giving insurance claim to complainant and directed opponent to pay amount of ₹12,94,731/- to complainant together with interest on that amount along with costs and compensation. Hence, we are of the opinion that the order passed by the Learned District Forum in that respect is to be set aside by allowing this appeal and complaint filed by the complainant is to be dismissed. We are of the opinion that complainant can recover the claim from M/s. MAERSK India Pvt. Ltd, who had not supplied proper container to them.”
Aggrieved by the Order dated 04.09.2018 passed by the State Commission, the Complainant Company, has filed the present Revision Petition before this Commission.
We have heard the learned Counsel for the Parties and perused the Memorandum of Revision and the Orders passed by the State Commission and the District Forum as also the material on record.
The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that even though in the Insurance Policy issued by the Opposite Party Insurance Company loss damage or expenses caused by insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the subject matter insured is excluded and in the deeming provision it has been mentioned that the packing shall deem to stowage in a container or liftvan but only when such stowage is carried out prior to attachment of this Insurance or by the Assured or their servants, it cannot be invoked in the present case for repudiating the Claim made by the Complainant Company for the reason that the Products were packed in 109 metal drums and there was no defect, insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the Products.After checking the temperature of the refrigeration system of the Container which was at the desired level, i.e., less than 50C, it was loaded in the Container fully stuffed for taking the same to JNPT, Nhava Sheva and because of some failure in the refrigeration mechanism of the Container, it cannot be said that there was insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the Products.According to him the learned State Commission has erred in law in allowing the Appeal filed by the Insurance Company and dismissing the Complaint.The Complainant Company is entitled for a sum of ₹12,94,731/- alongwith interest @12% p.a. from the date of filing of Complaint till realization as ordered by the District Forum and the Order passed by the District Forum should be restored and the Complaint be allowed.
The learned Counsel for the Respondent, however, submitted that it is not in dispute that because of the defect/failure in the refrigeration of the Container, the Products got damaged which is specifically covered in Clause 2.3 of the Exclusions mentioned in the Insurance Policy.According to him, the Order passed by the State Commission does not suffer from any illegality and calls for no interference.
We have given our thoughtful consideration to the various plea raised by the learned Counsel for the Parties.It is not in dispute that the Complainant Company had taken the Insurance Policy from the Opposite Party Insurance Company insuring the Container by which 109 metal drums of Products were being sent to M/s. Saudi Rook Wool Factory at Riyadh.The Container had an inbuilt refrigeration system.Before the Products were packed in the Container, the temperature of the Container was checked and it was found that it was at the requisite level, i.e., 5oC or less.Due to technical problem in the refrigeration system, the Container could not be shipped Overseas and was brought back to the factory of the Complainant Company.The quality of Products suffered because the requisite temperature could not be maintained in the Container.The only question is as to whether there was any insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the Product as mentioned in Clause 2.3 of the Exclusions in the Insurance Policy.For ready reference Clause 2.3 of the Exclusions Clause is reproduced below:-
“EXCLUSIONS
2.         In no case shall this insurance cover
…..
2.3       loss damage or expenses caused by insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the subject matter insured (for the purpose of this clause 2.3 “packing” shall be deemed to include stowage in a container or liftvan but only when such stowage is carried out prior to attachment of this Insurance or by the Assured or their servants)”
From a perusal of the aforesaid Exclusion Clause it is clear that the loss, damage or expenses caused by insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the subject matter insured is excluded.There is a deeming provision as to what should ‘Packing’ mean.It deems to include stowage in a container or liftvan but only when such stowage is carried out prior to attachment of this Insurance or by the Assured or their servants.Even though, packing includes stowage in a Container or liftvan but the loss or damage suffered by the Complainant Company cannot be said to be on account of insufficiency or unsuitability of packing or preparation of the Products insured.It is not in dispute that the Product which was to be sent to M/s. Saudi Rook Wool Factory at Riyadh was packed in 109 metal drums and after checking the temperature of the Container which was about 50C or less and after being satisfied, it was stuffed in the Container having refrigeration mechanism.If some defect had occurred in the refrigeration mechanism it cannot be attributed to any of the Terms, Clause or Conditions mentioned in Clause 2.3 of the Exclusionary Clause referred to by the learned Counsel for the Opposite Party Insurance Company which had already been reproduced hereinabove.
Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the Opposite Party Insurance Company had wrongly repudiated the claim made by the Complainant Company and the State Commission had erred in law in allowing the Appeal and dismissing the Complaint.
In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the considered opinion that the Petitioner is entitled to succeed.Consequently the Revision Petition is allowed and the Order dated 04.09.2018 passed by the State Commission in Appeal No. A/15/313 is set aside and the Order dated 14.10.2014 passed by the District Forum in Complaint No. 143 / 2008 is restored.The Complaint stands allowed.
However, in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the Parties shall bear their own Costs.

Mr. Ashkrit Tiwari, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","ORDER
HON’BLE MR. DINESH SINGH, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.    This Appeal has been filed under Section 19 of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 24.07.2019 in C.C. No. 231 of 2017 passed by The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Karnataka, hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’.
The Appellant herein, M/s NUDPL Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., was the Opposite Party before the State Commission, and is hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Builder Co.’.
The Respondents herein, Mr. Saiprasad Natrajan and Mrs. Shilpa Sundareshan, were the Complainants before the State Commission, and are hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Complainants’.
2.    Heard the learned Counsel for the Builder Co. on admission.
Perused the material on record including inter alia the Order dated 24.07.2019 of the State Commission and the Memorandum of Appeal.
3.    In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Builder Co., to settle the matter on merit, the delay of 05 days in filing the Appeal is condoned.
4.    The Complainants’ case before the State Commission was that they booked a residential unit with the Builder Co. for Rs. 81,24,360/-. An Agreement between the Builder Co. and the Complainants was executed on 11.03.2013. The Complainants paid Rs. 16,24,873/- to the Builder Co. in 2013. The Project had not even been initiated when the Builder Co. raised further demand. The Project was not completed by the agreed and assured date, i.e. 31.08.2015. The Project was nowhere nearing completion.
5.    The Complainants filed Consumer Complaint No. 231 of 2017 before the State Commission in 2017. The State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 24.07.2019, allowed the Complaint.
6.    It is noted that [a] it is admitted that Rs. 16,24,872/- were paid to the Builder Co. by the Complainants (in 2013); [b] the Project had not even been initiated when the Builder Co. raised further demand; [c] the Project was not completed by the agreed and assured date of completion (30.08.2015), or within a reasonable period thence (reasonable period here would connote such period as a reasonable man would not normally agitate); [d] there is nothing on record to show that the Complainants were not ready and willing to pay the balance consideration amount, as per the terms and conditions of the Agreement, provided it was visible that the Project had been initiated and it was reasonably evident that it would be completed by the agreed and assured date.
7.    The State Commission has observed in para 7 of its Order that “- - - it is evident that complainant purchased residential apartment in the project initiated by the OP under the name “Nitesh Cape Cod”. The sale consideration was Rs. 81,24,360/- out of which the complainant has paid a sum of Rs. 16,24,872/-. According to the terms, the OPs were required to hand over the possession on or before August 30, 2015.- - -” and that “- - -OP has not started the project itself.- - -”.
8.    The State Commission has passed a fair, reasoned Order; no jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible. The Award made appears just and equitable (“The above complaint is allowed with costs of Rs. 5,000/-. The OP is hereby directed to refund Rs. 16,24,872/- with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. from the date of receipt till the date of actual realization within 3 months from the date of this order failing which the complainant is at liberty to take steps to initiate recovery proceedings under Section 25 and criminal proceedings under Section 27 of Consumer Protection Act.”). There can be no two opinions that the amount deposited (Rs. 16,24,872/-) by the Complainants with the Builder Co. has necessarily to be refunded. In the facts and specificities of the case, the rate of interest (12% p.a.) appears reasonable.
9.    Prior to, or, at the least, simultaneous to, getting a Consumer to enter into its agreement and accepting the first payment towards the total cost of the subject unit, the Builder Co. was required and expected to have the due pragmatic and realistic assessment and preparation of the Project Planning, Execution and Completion.
It was the responsibility of the Builder Co. to ensure that it was in a position to complete the Project by the agreed and assured date and in all contingencies within a reasonable period thence (reasonable period here would again connote such period as a reasonable man would not normally agitate).
Project Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
(Normal) impediments or problems that arise in Planning, Execution and Completion were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Specifically, availability of land (/ acquisition of land), as well as all approvals from the concerned Government / Development / Municipal authorities, as and when due, being fundamental basic requirements of a construction Project, were decidedly the Builder Co.’s primary responsibilities, and not of the Consumer(s).
Its arrangements with any third party etc. or its arrangements with its contractors or sub-contractors etc. or its litigation etc. were its own concern / problem, and not of the Consumer(s).
Cost and Time Overruns were its responsibility, and not of the Consumer(s).
Non-fulfilment of its overall responsibilities of Project Planning, Execution and Completion can not be and are not grounds for condoning or overlooking delay in completion by the agreed and assured date.
10.  After making deposit of about Rs. 16.25 lakh in 2013, it should have been readily evident to the Consumer that [a] the Project has been duly initiated and [b] it would in all reasonable probability be completed by the agreed and assured date.
It cannot be that the Consumer keeps on making further and further deposits with the Builder Co., when it is evident to his naked eye that the Project has as yet not even been initiated and that in all probability it would not be completed by the agreed and assured date (31.08.2015).
11.  Pertinently, it is admitted, at the time of arguments, on 17.02.2020, before this Commission, that the Project has, even now, not been completed, its occupancy-cum-completion certificate has not been obtained.
12.  Ingredients of ‘deficiency in service’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(g) & (o) of the Act are well and truly evinced on the part of the Builder Co.
13.  The Act is for “better protection of the interests of consumers”, in recognizedly a fight amongst unequals.
Its Statement of Objects and Reasons says of “speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes”.
The Complainants deposited Rs. 16,24,872/- with the Builder Co. in 2013. Further demand was raised when then Project had not even been initiated. The Project was not completed by the agreed and assured date (31.08.2015). Even now (on 17.02.2020, at the time of arguments before this Commission), the Project is nowhere near completion.
The Complainants made their deposit in 2013. The Complaint before the State Commission was filed in 2017. It was decided in 2019. Appeal was filed before this Commission in 2019. We are now in 2020.
14.  This is a plain and simple case of a builder co., with wherewithal, on the one side, and an ordinary common consumer, without wherewithal, on the other side, with the builder co. first indulging in deficiency in service, causing loss and injury to the consumer, and then indulging in protracted litigation, in one, and then, two, Consumer Protection Fora. Before the second Forum, i.e. this Commission, its case fails at admission itself.
15.  All this is not viewed favourably, it necessitates advice and cost.
","16.  The Appeal, being patently ill-conceived and totally devoid of merit, is dismissed with stern advice of caution to the Builder Co., through its Chief Executive, by imposition of cost of Rs. 50,000/-, to be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission, within four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order.
17.  The State Commission’s impugned Order dated 24.07.2019 is affirmed.
The Award made by the State Commission is confirmed.
18.  The Builder Co. shall ensure compliance within four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order (para 16 and 17 above).
19.  The State Commission shall undertake execution as per the law for failure or omission in compliance within the stipulated period.
20.         It may be added that the liability qua the Complainants initiated the day they made their first deposit with the Builder Co., and it continues, as a continuing wrong.
The duties / responsibilities of Director are laid-down in The Companies Act, 2013.
The substantive principles of law as contained in Section 47 (‘Questions to be determined by the Court executing decree’) under Part II, Execution, of the CPC, may also be referred to.
The Director(s) of the Builder Co. shall have to discharge the onus to show that they are not liable, along with the Builder Co., jointly and severally, on the question being raised in the executing Forum in execution proceedings.
This observation is being made in reference to ‘Enforcement’ under Section 25(3) and ‘Penalties’ under Section 27 of the Act.
21.  The Registry is directed to send a copy each of this Order to the State Commission and to the Complainants within three days of its pronouncement.
Disposed.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :MR. V.S. CHOPRA 
  For the Respondent      :
","(ORAL)
1.         This revision petition has been filed against the order dated 31.10.2019 in appeal no. 466 of 2016 of the petitioner / insurance company.  Vide the said appeal, the insurance company had challenged the order of the District Forum dated 18.08.2016 in CC No. 3/2016 of the respondent / complainant.
2.         The brief facts of the case are that complainant Prahallad Rai Sultania ( now deceased) was the owner of the truck no.OR-16-D-8377 which was insured with the petitioner for the period 13.06.2013 to 12.06.2014 for a sum of Rs.7,70,000/-.  On 01.05.2014, the said truck got damaged since another loaded truck dashed against it while it had been parked on the left side of the road.  Driver on the said truck on that day was Dutia Behera.  The fact of accident was informed to the insurance company who deputed a surveyor to assess the loss.   The vehicle was repaired by Sri
-2-
Jagannath Motors who estimated the cost of Rs.7,09,482/-. The bills were submitted with the insurance company but the insurance company repudiated the claim on the ground that driver was not holding a valid effective driving license permitting him to carry in his vehicle dangerous and hazardous LPG Gas cylinder.  Hence, there was contravention of the policy condition.
3.         Parties led their evidences before the District Forum.  The District Forum after perusing the evidence on record and hearing the arguments of the counsel, held as under:
“3.  The OP- insurance company has repudiated the claim on the ground that the driver of the vehicle was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of accident on 1st May, 2014.  Annexure-1 is the copy of Driving License issued by the designated Authority in the name of Dutia Behera who was driving the insured vehicle at the time of the accident. The said License was issued on 02.08.2004 and is valid upto 17.11.2017 to drive transport vehicle.  Admittedly, the insured vehicle was used for transport of LPG cylinders (hazardous) on the date of accident.  The OP claims that the driving license issued by RTO, Raygada was not having endorsement to drive dangerous and hazardous goods but the driver on the date of accident was driving the vehicle with hazardous goods i.e. LPG cylinders.  On perusal of the annexure-1, it cannot be denied that the driving license No.OR-1820040007476 is not carrying any endorsement to drive the vehicle carrying hazardous goods.  It is clear to us that the driving license of the driver Sri Behera is though valid up to 17.11.2017 to drive transport vehicle but on perusal of the annexure-1 it was not effective.  Annexure-2 is the copy of certificate issued by RTO, Jharsuguda jointly with Plant Manager, IOCL, LPG Bottling Plant Jharsuguda in favour of the driver Dutta Behera.  In that annexure-2, the designated authority who used to issue driving license to the intending personnel, viz Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Jharsuguda has certified that the driver namely Dutia Behera having heavy motor vehicle driving license No.OR-1820040007476 (Annexure-1) had successfully, completed two days full training course on ‘safe Transportation of Hazardous POL products as per rule of LMV 1989 from 16.01.2014 to 17.01.2014.  Now question arises when RTO, Jharsuguda has approved the driver Sri Behera to have trained for safe transportation of hazardous POL products, non-endorsement to drive dangerous and hazardous goods in the annexure-1, can be taken as violation of policy condition.  No because in our opinion, designated authority who usually issue driving
-3-
license as RTO has issued both the annexure-1 can be a substitute on the annexure-1.  We therefore, do not agree with the grounds of repudiation to be justified. We hold that the driver of the insured vehicle at the time of accident was having valid and effective driving license.
4.         After reaching to the conclusion that driver was having a valid driving license, the District Forum directed as under:
“The complaint is allowed.  The OP-insurance company is directed to pay a sum of Rs.4,60,000/- (Rupees four lakh sixty thousand) only to the complainant towards full and final settlement of his claim along with interest @9% per annum from 06.10.2014 till payment.   The OP-insurance company also directed to pay Rs.2,000/- (Rs.two thousand) only towards cost to the complainant. The above stated directions shall be complied within 30 days from the date of this order.
5.         In appeal when this order was impugned, similar plea that driver of the vehicle was not carrying a valid driving license, had been raised.  After re-appreciating and re-assessing the evidence on record, the State Commission held as under:
“10.  On perusal of materials available on record it is found that the Driving Licence issued by Licensing Authority was for Light Motor Vehicle and Transport Vehicle, but there was no endorsement made permitting for driving vehicle for the purpose of transporting hazardous goods.  Though the driver had obtained one certificate upon two days training course on, ‘safe transportation of hazardous POL products’ as per rule-9 of CMV1989 from 16.01.2014 to 17.01.2014, and endorsed by RTO, Jharsuguda, but it was not incorporated in the Licence of the Driver.  It is evident from the Driving Licence that the Driver had valid licence to drive transport vehicle form 22.08.2005 to 22.09.2028.  The certificate for transporting hazardous goods was obtained during the policy period of the insured vehicle. As the driving licence was issued in the year 2005 for transport vehicle, there was no endorsement made by the licensing authority with regard to transporting hazardous goods.  In absence of such endorsement insurance company repudiated the claim of respondent on the ground of violation of policy condition.
11.  In the present case the specific case of the complainant is that the alleged accident occurred when the insured vehicle was parked on the left side of the road and another loaded truck dashed from behind and fled away.  Though the allegations are vaguely denied in the written version, the insurance company has not taken any specific stand regarding the manner in which the accident took place.  In such
-4-
circumstances, there is no reason to disbelieve the complainant’s version regarding the manner in which the accident took place.  Since accident was caused by the offending vehicle, when the insured vehicle was parked on the road side, the driver had nothing to do with the accident.  Possession of certificate with endorsement for driving vehicle carrying hazardous materials is irrelevant.
12.  Moreover, the concerned driver was having license for driving heavy transport vehicle and that he had undergone required training course on ‘safe Transportation of Hazardous POL products’ when the driving license issued to the driver was valid, non-inclusion of an endorsement in the driving license for driving vehicle carrying hazardous products is nothing but a technical or formal flow which should not come on come on the way of the insured vehicle owner to get indemnified in terms of the insurance policy.”
6.         This order is impugned before me.  It is argued that  Fora below had not exercised its jurisdiction properly and that findings are perverse since they have not considered Rule 9 of  Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.  It is submitted that as per rule 9, while the license holder is required to undergo training, it is also necessary that licensing authority should make an endorsement on the driving license of the license holder and since driving license of the driver was not having any such endorsement, the driving license was not valid in terms of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.
7.         I have given my thoughtful consideration to this contention of learned counsel and have perused the file.  From the concurrent findings of the fora below, it apparent that license authority had issued a certificate certifying that driver  had underwent training as per Rule 9 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules during the period 16.01.2014 to 17.01.2014 under OISD conducted by Indian Oil  Corporation Ltd., Jharsuguda Bottling Plant, Jharsuguda under the seal and signature of RTO, Jharsuguda and Plant Manager. This certificate duly confirms that driver had underwent training in terms of Rule 9 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 and
-5-
hence there is no violation of this rule on the part of the driver.  The question is. can a person be punished and denied his lawful claim simply because the concerned authority who is required to act  under the provision of law had failed to act?. This is glaring case where despite the fact that driver Dutia Behera had underwent training as per Rule 9 of Central Motor Vehicles Rule, 1989, the concerned authority did not make any endorsement on his driving license as per Rule 9 Sub Rule 3 of Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989.  The principle of natural justice does not permit that  person be denied its lawful right only on the ground that some authority had failed to discharge its duties properly.  These facts clearly show that driver had underwent training and was authorized to driver the hazardous goods.
8.         Counsel  has failed to point out any perversity in the findings of the Fora below.  It is settled proposition of law that this Commission under section 21 (b) of the Act is not authorized to re-appreciate or re-assess the findings and substitute its own findings especially when findings of the Fora below are concurrent findings on facts. It has been so held by the Honble Supreme Court in “Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2011) 11 SCC 269”, which is as under:
“23. Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said  power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums. The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts. This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of
-6-
the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed. It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two Fora”.
9.         Again in “Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286,” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated the same principle and has held as under:
“17.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
10.       In T.Ramalingeswara Rao  (Dead) Through L.Rs. and Ors. Vs. N.Madhava Rao and Ors. decided on 05.04.2019 passed in Civil Appeal No. 3408 of 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“12.     When the two Courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact against the Plaintiffs, which are based on appreciation of facts and evidence, in our view, such findings being concurrent in nature are binding on the High court. It is only when such findings are found to be against any provision of law or against the pleading or evidence or are found to be perverse, a case for interference may call for by the High Court in its second appellate jurisdiction.”
-7-
","11.       In view of the above discussion, I found no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.   The present revision petition has no merit and same is dismissed in limine with no order as to costs.

The complainant in this matter namely Smt. Harshaben N. Mehta  filed a Consumer Complaint in the year 2000, alleging therein that Late Sh. Suresh Bhai N. Patel who was carrying the business under the name & style of ‘S.P. Builders’, advertised for sale of residential flats in a housing scheme namely ‘Dev Apartments’ in Navrangpura, in the year 1979.  According to her, she visited the site where the work was going on and was informed by Late Sh. Suresh Bhai N. Patel that the cost of the flat would be Rs.1,20,000/- including the cost of land.  According to the complainant, she paid Rs.1,00,000/- by cheques and the balance amount in cash.  According to her, the construction was left incomplete and therefore, she had to occupy the incomplete flat in November 1982.  She also claimed to have incurred expenditure of Rs.51,621/- on completing the work which the builder had left incomplete. She approached the concerned State Commission by way of a Consumer Complaint seeking several reliefs including payment of Rs. 51,621/- from the builders.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the builder who stated in their written version that they were concerned only with the construction of the flat and had nothing to do with its land component.  It was also stated in their written version that only Rs.1,00,000/- were paid to them by the complainant and they had executed work to the extent payment was received by them, before they were thrown out by the complainant.
3.      The land owners who were impleaded as OP No.3 & 4 in the Consumer Complaint, also contested the Consumer Complaint on several grounds.
4.      The State Commission, vide impugned order dated 27.04.2012, partly allowed the complaint by directing the builders to pay the amount of Rs.51,621/- to the complainants alongwith interest and compensation quantified at Rs.25,000/- and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellants/builders are before this Commission.  The complainant has not challenged the order passed by the State Commission and the said Commission has not allowed the Consumer Complaint against the land owners.
5.      As noted earlier, the Consumer Complaint was instituted in the year 2000.  Though the complainant has not specified on which date the deficient work was completed by her, she has specifically alleged in the Consumer Complaint that the incomplete flat was occupied by her in November 1982.  A perusal of the complaint would show that she has claimed interest on the aforesaid amount of Rs.51,621/- with effect from the year 1982.  It is therefore, evident that the expenditure of Rs.51,621/- which the complainant claimed from the appellants, was incurred by her by the end of the year 1982.  The Consumer Complaint having been instituted in the year 2000, was patently barred by limitation as prescribed in Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act, on the date it was instituted.  Since the Consumer Complaint was barred by limitation, I need not examine the order passed by the State Commission on its merit.  The impugned order therefore, cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside with no order as to costs.
The amount, if any, deposited by the appellants in compliance of the order of the State Commission, be refunded to them, alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount.
","The amount, if any, deposited by the appellants in compliance of the order of the State Commission, be refunded to them, alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K. AGRAWAL,PRESIDENT HON'BLE DR. S.M. KANTIKAR,MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Milan Negi, Advocate


                                                Mr. Ashu Kansal, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","For the purpose of computation of the cases filed before the National Commission, the Office is directed to register the case as First Appeal and number it accordingly.
These First Appeals, under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2019 Act”), has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. through its Resolution Professional against the Order dated 13th March, 2020, passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi at New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in Complaint Cases No. 286, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306 & 307 of 2017, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants.  The State Commission by the Impugned Order has allowed the Complaints, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants, and directed M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) to refund the entire amount received from the Complainants, including service tax alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date on which entire amount alongwith compensation is refunded, with a further direction to pay ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation to each of the Complainants.  The payment was directed to be made within three months from receipt of copy of the Order.
An Application has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) for exemption from pre-deposit of the amount, as provided under Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, which has come into force w.e.f. 20th/24th July, 2020.
The learned Counsel appearing for M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) submitted that the Appellant is not in a position to deposit the amount as contemplated under the Second Proviso to Section 51(1) of the 2019 Act. The learned Counsel further submitted that under Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act an Appeal lies to the National Commission from an Order passed in Appeal by the State Commission, where there is no requirement of pre-deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission, whereas under the Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act the Appellant is required to deposit fifty  percent of the amount in terms of the Order passed by the State Commission before the National Commission so that the National Commission may entertain the Appeal.  A harmonious construction of the various provisions of Section 51 of the 2019 Act has to be made and, if that is done, then the necessary corollary is that the deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission for entertaining the appeal is not mandatory but only directory in nature.
The learned Counsel also referred to and relied upon a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors., reported in (2014) 8 SCC 657, and submitted that it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay.
We have heard the learned Counsel for the M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) and have considered the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel.
Before adverting to the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, we deem it appropriate for ready reference to reproduce Section 51 of the 2019 Act:
“51. (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 47 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the National Commission shall not entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of  thirty days unless it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the National Commission from any order passed in appeal by any State Commission, if the National Commission is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
(3) In an appeal involving a question of law, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.
(4) Where the National Commission is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question and hear the appeal on that question:
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the National Commission to hear, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question of law.
(5) An appeal may lie to the National Commission under this section from an order passed ex parte by the State Commission.”
From a perusal of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, we find that under Sub Section (1) a right of Appeal  has been given to any person who is aggrieved by the Order passed by the State Commission in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47. Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47 deals with the powers of the State Commission to entertain Complaints only. The Appeal has to be filed within a period of thirty days of such Order. However, the First Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 gives the discretion to the National Commission to entertain the Appeal even after the period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period meaning that it has the power to condone the delay in filing the Appeal beyond thirty days. The Second Proviso to sub Section (1) of Section 51 provides  that the Appeal shall not be entertained by the National Commission of the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of the Order of the State Commission unless fifty percent of that amount has been deposited.
Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act provides a second Appeal to be preferred before the National Commission in an order passed by the State Commission in Appeal.  However, the second Appeal should involve a substantial question of law. Sub Section 3 to 5 of Section 51 are not being referred to as they are not relevant for deciding the issue involved in these cases.
In our considered opinion the intention of the Parliament while enacting 2019 Act is that if the Complaint has been decided by any one forum then the person who has been directed to pay certain amount should deposit fifty percent of that amount if a first Appeal is being filed before the next forum.  The provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 deals with the First Appeal being filed before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in the Complaint Case and, therefore, there is a requirement of deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.
We may mention here that similar provision has been made by the Parliament in Section 41 of the 2019 Act, which provides for preferring an appeal against an order passed by the District Forum before the State Commission.  For ready reference, Section 41 is reproduced below:
“41. Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Commission may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty-five days from the date of the order, in such form and manner, as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of forty-five days, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed:
Provided also that no appeal shall lie from any order passed under sub-section (1) of section 81 by the District Commission pursuant to a settlement by mediation under section 80.”
Likewise, under Section 67 of the 2019 Act, a provision has been made for filing an Appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against an order passed by the National Commission under Sub-Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 58, which deals with the orders passed in the Complaint Cases.  The Second Proviso of Section 67 also requires deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the National Commission before the Appeal can be entertained by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  For ready reference, Section 67 of the 2019 Act is reproduced below:
“67. Any person, aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 58, may prefer an appeal against such order to the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of the order:
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless that person has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.”
From a reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is absolutely clear that the Parliament wanted to make it mandatory for the Opposite Party in the Complaint Case to deposit a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded by the Consumer Fora/Commissions while preferring First Appeal.
So far as the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors. (Supra), relied upon by the learned Counsel, is concerned, we may mention here that in Paragraph-11 and 12 of the said decision, the Apex Court has held that unless the Appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the Appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission.  Paragraphs 11 and 12are reproduced below for ready reference:
“11. The second proviso to Section 19 of the Act mandates pre-deposit for consideration of an appeal before the National Commission. It requires 50% of the amount in terms of an order of the State Commission or 35,000/- whichever is less for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission. Unless the appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission. A pre-deposit condition to deposit 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission or Rs.35,000/- being condition precedent for entertaining appeal, it has no nexus with the order of stay, as such an order may or may not be passed by the National Commission. Condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals.
(Underlined by us)
12. It is not the case of any of the appellants that the Consumer Forum including State and National Commissions has no power to pass interim order of stay. If the National Commission after hearing the appeal of the parties in its discretion wants to stay the amount awarded, it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay. Entertainment of an appeal and stay of proceeding pursuant to order impugned in the appeal stands at different footings, at two different stages. One (pre-deposit) has no nexus with merit of the appeal and the other (grant of stay) depends on prima facie case; balance of convenience and irreparable loss of party seeking such stay.”
(Underlined by us)
Thus, the condition for pre-deposit of 50% awarded by the State Commission in Complaint Case in an Appeal preferred before the National Commission is mandatory. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Shreenath Corp. & Others (Supra) in paragraph 11 reproduced above condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals. This Commission cannot entertain any Appeal unless the concerned Appellant has deposited 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.  There is no provision in the 2019 Act, empowering the National Commission to waive, relax or reduce the amount to be deposited under the Second Proviso, referred to above.  The present First Appeals are, therefore, defective for want of pre-deposit of the fifty percent of the amount directed by the State Commission in the impugned Order, which has not been made by the Appellant.
","          Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.     
Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.

  For the Petitioner     :Ms. Surekha Raman, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Ms. R.P. Singh, Advocate for R-3.
R-1 & 2 are ex-parte. 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
No one is present for the complainant who was preceded ex parte vide order dated 27.02.2019. No one is present for the R-1 Bengal Automobile Services. R-3 State Bank of India, however, is represented by counsel.
2.      I have heard the Ld. counsel for the petitioner and R-3 and have considered the record.
3.      The complainant purchased a minidor from respondent number 2 Bengal Automobile taking a loan from R-3 State Bank of India. The vehicle was purchased in January 2007. His primary grievance is that at the time of sale of the vehicle as well as in the documents given to him at that time it was represented to him that the vehicle being sold to him had been manufactured in the year 2006 whereas on registration of the vehicle it transpired that it had been manufactured in the year 2005. Another grievance of the complainant was that that there were some defects in the vehicle which was acknowledged by the seller Ms/ Bengal Automobile by way of a letter but the said defects were not removed. The complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint impleading the petitioner which is the manufacturer of the vehicle, M/s Bengal Automobile which had sold the vehicle to him as well as the State Bank of India as the parties to the consumer complaint.
4.      The consumer complaint was resisted by the petitioner company which denied having represented to the complainant is that the vehicle had been manufactured in the year 2006. It was admitted in the written version filed by the petitioner company that the vehicle had been manufactured in the year 2005. The petitioner also maintained that there was absolutely no manufacturing defect in the vehicle.
","5.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 05.02.2015 the State Commission dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner company. Being aggrieved the petitioner is before this Commission.
6.      It is evident from the sale certificate issued by the dealer M/s Bengal Automobiles as well as from the  delivery letter issued by them to the complainant that at the time of the sale of the vehicle they had represented to the complainant that the vehicle being sold to him was a 2006 model meaning thereby that it had been manufactured in the year 2006. It is admitted by none other than the manufacture of the vehicle and is also evident from the registration certificate that the vehicle had in fact been manufactured in the year 2005. It is thus established that a misrepresentation was made to the complainant at the time of sale of the vehicle by claiming the said vehicle had been manufactured in the year 2006. The said misrepresentation was made by the seller M/s Bengal Automobiles and not by the petitioner company which is the manufacturer of the vehicle. There is no evidence or any other material to indicate that the dealer had misrepresented to the complainant in connivance with the petitioner company. Therefore, it will be difficult to hold that the petitioner company is responsible in any manner for the above referred misrepresentation as regards the year of manufacturing of the vehicle.
7.      Coming to the alleged defects of the vehicle admittedly no Automobile Engineer or any technical expert was produced by the complainant to prove that the vehicle suffered from any manufacturing defect. The letter by the dealer Bangal Automobiles to the complainant was issued on 06.02.2007 and is a handwritten letter on which the name of the author cannot be ascertained. It is stated in the letter that the minidor had starting trouble and the author felt that there was a pump problem. The author of this this letter was not produced as a witness nor was his affidavit filed by the complainant by way of evidence. Moreover, in the letter sent to the car dealer on 10.04.2007 the complainant had alleged so many problems in the vehicle. However only one specific defect was mentioned in the aforesaid letter and it was alleged that the colour of the vehicle  had been changed. There is no mention of any defect in the pump of the vehicle. If the original colour of the vehicle had been changed, it could be done by the car dealer and not by the manufacturer which had already delivered the vehicle to the dealer on 29.06.2005 more than one year before the vehicle was sold the complainant. It is also the submission of the counsel for the petitioner that the complainant applied for a loan on 13.02.2007 which no reasonable person would do if the vehicle had the trouble mentioned in the purported letter of the dealer dated 06.02.2007. Be that as it may, in the absence of an expert evidence it would be difficult to say the vehicle had manufacturing defects.
8.      Since no misrepresentation was made by the petitioner to the complainant and no manufacturing defect in the vehicle has been proved the petitioner company cannot be held liable to replace the vehicle by a new vehicle or to compensate the complainant in any manner.
9.      The Revision petition is, therefore, allowed and the consumer complaint qua the petitioner company alone stands dismissed with no order as to costs. It is made clear that the order passed by the fora below to the extent the said order is directed against the dealer M/s Bangal Automobiles remains unaltered. The Revision Petition stands disposed of.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr.Akash Kakade, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Ms.Gurmeet Bindra, Advocate 
","1.      The present revision petition has been filed against the order dated 07.10.2015 in First appeal No.A/09/418 of the respondent whereby the order of the District Forum dated 02.04.2009 in complaint No.727/2008    of the petitioner was modified.
2.      In brief, the admitted facts of the case are that the complainant/petitioner had taken a loan for the purchase of his vehicle and hypothecated with the respondent against the said loan.  There was some default on the part of the complainant to repay the instalments towards the loan amount.  The notice dated 4.10.2008, informing the petitioner about the defaults and asking him to make the payment was received by the
-2-
petitioner and thereafter on account of further defaults, the respondent seized the subject vehicle and subsequently sold the same.
3.      The plea taken by the respondent was that there was no deficiency in service on their part since it was the driver of the petitioner who himself had surrendered the vehicle, in view of the inability of the petitioner to repay the loan.  Parties led their evidences before the District Forum.  District Forum after appreciating the evidences and the documents and hearing the arguments of learned counsel’s for the parties concluded that there was deficiency of service on the part of the respondents and issued following directions :
“1. The complaint of the complainant is partly allowed.
2. The complainant is directed to pay the amount of only outstanding instalments of loan till the date of the order and thereafter to pay remaining instalments of vehicle/truck as per the agreement till 01/10/2010.
3. The non-applicant is directed to hand over the custody of truck bearing registration No.MH-40 – 4976 within five days on the payment of the amount mentioned above.
4. The non-applicant is directed to pay Rs.2,000/- to the complainant towards physical and mental harassment.
5. The non-applicant is directed to pay Rs.1,000/- to the complainant towards the cost of the complaint.
-3-
6. The non-applicant is directed to comply with the directions at Sr. No.3 within 5 days from the date of receiving amount from the complainant and further directed to comply with the directions at Sr.No.4 & 5 within 30 days from the date of receiving copy of the said order.”
4.      In appeal, this Order was impugned by the respondent and after re-appreciating and hearing the learned counsel for the parties at length, the State Commission agreed with the finding of the District Forum on account of deficiency in service on the part of the respondents.  Since the respondent had filed the documents before the State Commission, proving that the vehicle had already been sold, the State Commission modified the direction No.2,3 and 6 of the order dated 02.04.2009 of the District Forum and after deducting the unpaid loan amount from the sale proceed of the truck, ordered the payment of Rs.83,120/-.  Following directions were issued by the State Commission :
“i) The appeal is partly allowed.
ii) The clause Nos.2 and 3 of the impugned order is quashed and set aside.  The appellant is directed to pay Rs.83,120/- amount received in excess to the complainant within one month.
iii) Rest of the directions in the impugned order are maintained.
-4-
iv) Copy of order be furnished to both the parties free of cost.”
5.      During the arguments the petitioner/complainant confined its arguments/relief in increase of compensation towards mental harassment.  It is argued that the amount of compensation for mental and physical harassment of Rs.2,000/- is inappropriate, and much less. He had suffered losses in the business due to illegal seizure of his vehicle and he had also suffered mentally and it has also caused physical harassment to him.
6.      It is further argued that the petitioner could not produce any substantive evidence for actual calculation of the loss suffered by it, but the facts and circumstance clearly show that he had suffered losses and, therefore, had suffered mentally and physically on this count.  It is submitted that petitioner be awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards mental and physical harassment.
7.      Learned counsel for the respondent submits that they have duly complied with the impugned order and that the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation because they had duly followed the subject procedure. This argument has no merit because there is a concurrent finding of the Fora below that there is deficiency of service on the part of the respondent in seizing and selling the vehicle.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of        Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 2011 (3) Scale 654 has clearly held that this Commission has limited jurisdiction and is not required to re-appreciate and re-assesse the provision in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 21 B and substitute its own opinion where there are concurrent findings of the Fora below on the facts.  Even otherwise, this is not a revision petition filed by the respondent challenging the finding of deficiency in service by the Foras below.
","8.      I am satisfied that on the facts and circumstances of this case, the compensation of Rs.2,000/- towards mental and physical harassment needs to be enhanced.  In the facts and circumstances, the compensation towards mental and physical harassment is raised from Rs.2,000/- to Rs.15,000/-.  The impugned order is modified to this effect.  Rest of the order remains the same.  With these directions, the present revision petition stands disposed of.

","ORDER (ORAL)
The present revision petition has been filed against an order in appeal No.1019 of 2017 of the petitioner challenging the order of the District Forum in Execution Application No. EA of 106 of 2015.  It has been held by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Karnataka Housing Board vs. K. A. Nagamani, (2019) 6 SCC 424.” The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the execution proceedings are different than the consumer disputes and an order passed in appeal in execution proceedings by the State Commission cannot be considered to be an order passed on a consumer dispute and hence, the Revision Petition cannot be filed against such order.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
7.3.  The nature of execution proceedings is materially different from the nature of proceedings for adjudication of a 14 consumer complaint. Execution proceedings are independent proceedings. Orders passed for enforcement of the final order in the Consumer dispute, cannot be construed to be orders passed in the ‘consumer dispute’.
7.4.   xxxxxxxxxxxx
7.5.   xxxxxxxxxxxx
7.6    xxxxxxxxxxxx
7.7.  We affirm the view taken by the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and Patna High Court. Execution proceedings even though they are proceedings in a suit, cannot be considered to be a continuation of the original suit. Execution proceedings are separate and independent proceedings for execution of the decree. The merits of the claim or dispute, cannot be considered during execution proceedings. They are independent proceedings initiated by the decree holder to enforce the decree passed in the substantive dispute.
7.8. There is no remedy provided under Section 21 to file a Revision Petition against an Order passed in appeal by the State Commission in execution proceedings. Section 21(b) does not provide for filing of a Revision Petition before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in execution proceedings
7.9.   xxxxxxxxxxxxx
8.      xxxxxxxxxxxxx
9.      In view of the aforesaid discussion, we affirm the judgment of the Delhi High Court, which has rightly set aside the Order passed by the National Commission on the ground that a Revision Petition was not maintainable against the Order passed by the State Commission in an appeal arising out of execution proceedings.
","                   The present revision petition is dismissed.
The present revision petition is dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent applied to the appellant on 10.12.2018 for allotment of a residential apartment in a project namely Casa Bella Gold, Dombivali East for a consideration of ₹41,739,84/-.  The following was the payment plan recorded in the application which the Complainant had submitted to the appellant for allotment:-
“Sl. No.       Stage                                      Payment             Cumulative

12.              On initiation of 9th  Slab                  5%                       90.0%

2.      It was also stated in the application that considering the stage of construction at that time, 92.5% of the value of the flat had become payable which would be paid in two instalments first instalment being payable within 21 days of the application and constituting 20% of the cost of the flat and the second instalment being due within 42 days of the application and constituting 72.5% of the cost of the flat.  The complainant made payment of ₹19,19,935/- to the appellant.  Thereafter, the allotment was cancelled by the appellant vide its letter dated 06.04.2012 which, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
1.         We refer to your captioned Application Form whereby you had applied for allotment in  respect of the subject Residential Flat. We confirm that at the time of the aforesaid Application, you had paid a sum of ₹45000/- (Rupees Forty Five Thousand Only) towards Booking Amount and ₹1970497/- (Rupees  Nineteen Lakhs Seventy Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety Seven Only) towards first, second, On registration, Plinth and Part payment of Slab 1.  In terms of the aforesaid Application you were required to pay a sum of ₹2099135/ (Rupees Twenty Lakhs Ninety tine Thousand One Hundred and Thirty Five Only) towards the due instalment for ""Slab 1 to Slab 18”.
2.         We have already informed you by our demand letters and Interest Letters for the payment of the aforesaid sum of ₹2099135/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs Ninety Nine Thousand One Hundred and Thirty Five Only). Despite repeated requests and reminders, you have failed and neglected to pay the said dues instalment payments of ₹20,99,135/- (Rupees Twenty Lakhs Ninety Nine Thousand One Hundred and Thirty Five Only). Accordingly, we have to inform you that your Application for Allotment of the subject Residential Flat is and hereby stands rejected with Immediate effect and in terms of the captioned Application Form, the Booking Amount paid by you is and hereby stands forfeited.”
3.     Complainant sent a legal notice to the appellant on 16.07.2012 which the appellant responded on 07.09.2012.  While responding to the legal notice of the complainant, the appellant also called upon the complainant to collect the cheque of ₹19,25,497/- on return of the original document and papers through her authorized representative.  It was also informed to the complainant that the appellant had already created third party interest in the flat which it had allotted to the complainant.
4.      Being aggrieved, the complainant approached the concerned state commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking compensation of the allotted flat with compensation.
5.      The complaint was resisted by the appellant primarily on the ground that the complainant having failed to make balance payment, it was justified in cancelling the allotment and forfeiting the sum of  ₹45,000/- out of the money which the complainant had deposited.
6.      During the course of hearing before the State Commission, the complainant expressed her willingness to take refund of the amount which she had paid to the appellant along-with 18% interest. The State Commission thereupon directed refund of the amount of ₹1919935/- to the complainant along with 18% interest, compensation quantified at ₹2,00,000/- and the cost of litigation quantified at ₹25,000/-.   Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
7.      It would be seen from a perual of the application form itself  that the complainant knew, at the time of booking itself, that 92.5% of the cost of the apartment had become due and will have to be paid by him within 42 days of the application in two instalments, the first instalment being payable within 21 days of the application. It is an admitted position that 92.5% of the cost of the flat  was not paid by the complainant within 42 days of the application.  Therefore, it cannot be disputed that the complainant had defaulted in making payments in terms of the payment which she had agreed with the appellant.
8.      The submission of the learned Counsel for the complainant is that in view of the provisions of Section 4 of Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, the appellant could not have taken more  than 20% of the cost of the flat without first executing the agreement with the complainant. Admittedly, the complainant had paid more than 20% of the cost of the flat to the appellant. Admittedly, the agreement in terms of Section 4 of MoFA was not executed by the appellant even after receiving more than 20% of the sale consideration.  The appellant, therefore, clearly committed breach of Section 4 of MOFA by accepting more than 20% of the sale consideration from the Complainant without executing agreement with her.
9.      Thus, we are faced with a situation where the developer is at fault on accunt of its having not executed agreement in terms of Section 4 of MOFA with the flat buyer and the flat buyer is also in default, she having not paid 92.5% of the cost of the flat in terms of the payment plan which she had agreed with the builder.  Considering that the appellant was prohibited by law from accepting more than 20% of the sale consideration without executing agreement of the Complainant, I am of the view that forfeiture of Rs. 45,000/- out of the payment made by the complainant to the appellant was not justified.  Therefore, the appellant has rightly been directed to refund the entire principal amount of  ₹1919935/- to the complainant.
10.    It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant that they having offered payment to the complainant way back on 07.09.2012, there will be no justification for directing the appellant to pay interest to the complainant.  However, the fact remains that the money which the appellant was seeking to refund to the complainant remained with the appellant and continued to be utilized by it.  Moreover, there is breach of Section 4 of MOFA on the part of the appellant.  Considering these factors, the appellant, in my opinion, must compensate the complainant by paying appropriate interest to her.
11.    Coming to the quantum of interest the submission of the learned Counsel for the Complainant is that since as per the terms of the transaction the builder could have recovered interest @ 18% p.a. from the complainant in the event of default, interest at the same rate should be awarded to the complainant.  However, I find no merit in this submission.  The compensation under the Consumer Protection Act is to commensurate with the loss suffered by the consumer on account of deficiency on the part of the service provider in rendering services to him.  No evidence was led by the complainant before the State Commission to prove the actual loss suffered by her on account of the appellant having not executed the agreement in terms of Section 4 of MOFA and having accepted more than 20% of the sale consideration from her without executing such an agreement.  No evidence was led by the complainant to prove the market value of flat in question on the date the allotment came to be cancelled, in order to prove her actual loss, if any,  on account of appreciation, in the market value of such flats.  In the absence of such an evidence, the State Commission in my opinion was not justified in awarding interest @ 18% p.a. to the complainant/respondent.
","12.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeal is disposed of with the following directions:-
(i)      The appellant shall refund the entire principal amount of ₹19,19,935/- to the complainant/respondent along with compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% p.a. w.e.f. date of each payment.
(ii) The  amount payable to the complainant in terms of this order  shall be released to her out of the amount which the appellant had deposited with the State Commission.  The balance amount will be refunded to the appellant by the State Commission. The interest @ 10% p.a.  on the principal amount of ₹19,19,935/- shall be paid to the Complainant till the date on which the said amount was deposited with the State Commission. Thereafter the complainant will be entitled to such interest which the said principal amount, deposited with the State Commission had earned.
(iii)     The appellant shall pay sum of ₹20,000/- as the cost of litigation to the complainant/respondent.
(iv)    Payment in terms of this order shall be made within two months from today.
13.    Conveyance charges have not been paid to the respondent/complainant and shall be sent to her by way of a cheque within one week from today.

Mr. Prabhakar Tiwari, Advocate 
","The complainant before this Commission is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 on 18.08.2016.  The aims and objectives of the complainant include the following:
18A.  That the present association is an association of flat buyers and the members thereof have common interests being purchasers/consumer in the same project and as defined under the Consumer Protection Act.  It is made clear that the present association has not been formed for making financial gains, rather the sole purpose of association is to serve the cause of the society/members in general and to protect the rights of its Members being Consumer and Purchaser of flats.
18B.  That the members of the present association have joined hands together on their own freewill and without being motivated by any financial consideration.  The main objectives of the present association is to pursue, propagate, advance, safeguard and promote the interests of the members in general before the Hon’ble National Commission, State Commissions, District Forums under the Consumer Protection Act, Hon’ble Tribunals, Hon’ble High Court and Hon’ble Supreme Court being a purchaser of flats and consumer as defined under the Consumer Protection Act.
2.      The complainant therefore, claims to be a recognized Consumer association in terms of Section 12(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The complaint has been instituted on behalf of as many as 40 buyers of residential flats in a project namely ‘Parsvnath Exotica’ which was proposed to be developed in Ghaziabad.  The complaint was instituted against two companies namely ‘Parsvnath Developers Limited’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘PDL’) and ‘Parsvnath Buildwell Pvt. Ltd.’ (hereinafter referred to as ‘PBPL’).  One of the allottees on whose behalf this complaint was instituted, having withdrawn, the complaint now continues on behalf of the remaining 39 allottees of the above referred project.  The details of the allottments made to the above referred persons have been given in Annexure P-4 to the complaint and need not be reproduced in this judgment.  The allottees at serial number 24 namely Ms. Preeti Dewan and Mr. Nitin Dewan have withdrawn from this complaint and therefore, the allotment made to the remaining 39 allottees is the subject matter of this Consumer Complaint.
3.      Out of the above referred 39 allottees, four allottees (at serial number 23 i.e. Ms. Ashti Khan and Dr. Sabha Anwar Khan, at serial number 30 i.e. Mr. Ram Parvesh and Ms. Savitri Devi, at serial number 34 Ms. Ajiti Misra and Ms. Prabha Rani and at serial number 40 i.e. Ms. Kiran Lata and Col. D.N. Karan) had executed agreements with ‘Parsvnath Developers Ltd.’ whereas remaining 35 allottees had executed agreements with ‘Parsvnath Buildwell Pvt. Ltd.’  The agreements were executed on different dates between 2012 to 2014 and the grievance of the allottees is that despite they having made substantial payments, the possession of the allotted flats was not offered to them and even the construction was not complete.  The complainant is therefore, seeking refund of the amount paid by the above referred 39 allottees alongwith compensation and interest on the said amounts.
4.      The complaint has been resisted by the OPs who have not disputed the allotment made to the above referred 39 allottees and the payments received from them.  It is inter-alia stated in their written version that PDL had entered to a development agreement with a company namely ‘M/s Devidayal Aluminium Industries Pvt. Ltd.’ Where-under PDL was to carry out development, construction and sale of areas on the land owned by M/s Devidayal Aluminium Industries Pvt. Ltd.  An SPV in the name of Parsvnath Buildwell Pvt. Ltd. was then formed in order to expedite the construction and development.  The OPs have sought to justify the delay in completion of the construction on several grounds including the acts and omissions attributed to M/s Devidayal Aluminium Industries Pvt. Ltd.
5.      It is evident from the Certificate of Registration of the complainant that the complainant is a registered society.  It is also evident from a perusal of its aims and objectives that one of the objects behind formation of the complainant association was to advance the interests and rights of the consumers particularly those who had taken allotments in the project which was proposed to be developed by the OPs in Ghaziabad.  Therefore, being a recognized consumer association, the complainant is competent to institute this complaint.
6.      A preliminary objection with respect to the maintainability of the Consumer Complaint has been taken by Sh. Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel for the OPs.  He has pointed out that in a Consumer Complaint instituted u/s 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, the requisite permission to institute a Consumer Complaint on behalf of all the allottees of the above referred project was granted by this Commission on 20.02.2017 in CC No.889 of 2016 and having been instituted later than grant of the aforesaid permission, this Consumer Complaint is not maintainable, the only remedy available to the concerned allottees being  to join in the Consumer Complaint in which permission u/s 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act was granted by this Commission.  A reference in this regard is made to the decision rendered by a three-Members Bench of this Commission on 07.10.2016 in CC No.97 of 2016 Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.
7.       Admittedly, the complainant had instituted a Consumer Complaint being CC No.1672 of 2016 before this Commission which was withdrawn on 02.11.2017.  While permitting withdrawal of the above referred complaint, this Commission had granted liberty to the complainant to file a fresh complain on the same cause of action.  In terms of the decision of this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), once a permission in terms of Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act is granted, an individual complaint will not be maintainable if the reliefs claimed are the same which were claimed in the Consumer Complaint in which the permission u/s 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act was granted.  However, as specifically held by the larger Bench of this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), the Consumer Complaints which had been instituted prior to grant of permission u/s 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, would not be affected by such permission and would continue for adjudication.  CC No.1672 of 2016 was pending before this Commission on the date on which permission u/s 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act was granted by this Commission in CC No.889 of 2016 on 20.02.2017.  Though the aforesaid complaint was later withdrawn on 02.11.2017, it was not a withdrawal simpliciter and the complainant had sought and was granted liberty to file a fresh complaint on the same cause of action.  In my opinion, this Commission having specifically granted liberty to file a fresh complaint on the same cause of action and that order having not been challenged by any party, the present complaint would be maintainable despite the permission in terms of Section 12(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act in CC No. 889 of 2016 having been granted by this Commission before this fresh complaint on the same cause of action was instituted.
","8.      Coming to the merits of the complaint, this Commission, vide its order dated 06.05.2016, had allowed a Consumer Complaint filed by another association of flat buyers in this very project by way of a detailed judgment and directed refund of the amount which the concerned allottee has paid with interest and compensation.  The defence taken on merit therefore need not be examined afresh in this complaint. An appeal being Civil Appeal No.5335 of 2016 was preferred by Parsvnath Buildwell Pvt. Ltd. against the order alongwith Civil Appeal No.5336 of 2016 which is stated to have been filed by PDL.  The appeals were disposed of by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 29.11.2019.  During the pendency of the appeal, the appellants were directed from time to time to make certain deposits with the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  Later on, the Hon’ble Supreme Court directed release of the amount deposited by the allottees to them alongwith interest @ 10% per annum.  While deciding the appeal vide its final order dated 29.11.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court also upheld the compensation awarded by this Commission.
9.      The learned counsel for the complainant who has taken instructions from the allottees, states on instructions that considering the decline in the rates of interest and the pandemic situation in the country, the complainants are restricting their prayer to the refund of the principal amount paid by them alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% per annum from the date of each payment till the date on which the Hon’ble Supreme Court had directed disbursal of interest @ 10% per annum in Civil Appeal no. 5335 of 2016 and for the subsequent period, the allottees are restricting their claim to compensation in the form of simple interest @ 8% per annum.  He also submits that on the principal of parity, the complainant is also claiming the lump-sum compensation of Rs.3 lacs each which was upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court while deciding Civil Appeal no. 5335 of 2016.
10.    In view of the above referred decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the statement made by the learned counsel for the complainant on instructions, the complaint is disposed of with the following directions:

For the Respondent No.2         :         Mr. Dibyajyoti Raha, Advocate 
","1.       This appeal is directed against the order of the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission) dated 21.08.2014 in CC/38/2012.
2.       Alongwith the Appeal, IA/7460/2018, application for condonation of delay of 17 days has been filed. For the reasons stated in the application, delay is condoned.
3.       Case of the Complainant is that on 06.02.2012, the Complainant connected the burner with new gas cylinder. After two days only i.e. 08.02.2012, the cylinder stopped working and some black liquid was leaking from of the cylinder. The Complainant contacted the distributor, who advised the Complainant to make a Complaint to LPG Emergency Service. They sent a mechanic for inspection, who found that black liquid was leaking from the cylinder and prepared the inspection report. The Complainant wrote a letter to the Area Manager, Indian Oil Corporation on 10.02.2012, but in vain. Being deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on the part of the Opposite Parties, the Complainant filed a Consumer Complaint before the State Commission with the following prayer: -
“a.    Award for a sum of Rs.30,00,000/- on account of life and property as stated in paragraph 23 above.
b.       Award for a sum of Rs.60,00,000/- on account of compensation for adopting unfair trade practice and deficiency in service as stated in paragraph 23 above.
c.       Award for a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- on account of mental agony and litigation cost as stated in paragraph 23 above.
d.       Award for interest and interest on judgment at the rate of 18 percent per annum.
e.       Award for the costs of and incidentals to the proceedings.
f.        Further or other relief or reliefs.”
4.       The Opposite Parties contested the Complaint by filing written statement. They denied the allegations stating that after obtaining the inspection report, they provided a new gas cylinder to the Complainant free of cost in replacement of the alleged defective cylinder. They requested the Complainant to return the defective cylinder for making proper inspection, but the Complainant refused to return the cylinder. The allegation of filling of water in the cylinder could not be ascertained. Opposite Party No.3 filed separate written version and denied all the allegations. Opposite Parties pleaded that the Complaint was baseless and the same be dismissed.
5.       State Commission after hearing learned Counsel for the parties and going through the record, found deficiency in service on the part of Opposite Parties No.1 and 2 and allowed the Complaint in part. Complaint against Opposite Party No.3, distributor was dismissed. State Commission directed as follows:-
“That the complaint be and the same is allowed in part. The OP Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- jointly and severally to the complainant as compensation for deficiency in service. The said OPs shall also pay a sum of Rs.10,000/- to the Complainant as litigation cost. The entire payment shall be made within a period of 45 days from the date of this order, in default interest @ 9% on the said sum shall  be payable till final realization.
OP Nos. 1 and 2 are further directed to take steps through suitable advertisement within a period of 3 months from the date of this order for making LPG consumers aware about the significance of alpha-numerical code as statutorily required to be put on the plate attached to a gas cylinder.”
6.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, Opposite Parties No.1 & 2 (Indian Oil Corporation) has filed the present Appeal.
7.       Heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the record. Learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the State Commission passed the impugned order ignoring the fact that the Complainant attached and detached the cylinder several times and even put the water on the cylinder. Therefore, the Complainant mishandled the cylinder due to which problem had occurred. It was also submitted that the Complainant did not permit the Appellant to make detailed inspection of the cylinder. It, therefore, cannot be said as to what the actual problem was and there was a possibility that the cylinder might have been tempered by the Complainant himself. It was further submitted that the State Commission held that no accident had taken place and no harm was caused to the Complainant. Even then the State Commission held the Appellant deficient of service, which in itself is contrary to the observation of the State Commission. Learned Counsel for the Appellant also submitted that the cylinder was supplied after statutory testing.
8.       Learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant submitted that the order passed by the State Commission was justified and the Appeal should be dismissed.
9.       During the pendency of the Appeal, this Commission vide order dated 18th November, 2016, directed for inspection of the gas cylinder by a team of technical expert. Mr. Santanu Sinha, Manager (LPG-Sales) Kolkata-1 Sales Area submitted his report dated 19.06.2017 which read as follows: -
“Ref: IND/KAO/NCDRC
Date: 19.06.2017
INSPECTION REPORT
Date & Time of Inspection: 19.06.2017, 8.45 am
Place of Inspection: Residence of Sri Malay Kumar Majumdar
7/1 Haltu Kayasthapara, 1st Lane
PO: Haltu, PS: Garfa
Kolkata-78
Inspected item: 14.2 kg Indane LPG Cylinder having Batch No.:2430, Sr. No.Illegible, Mgf date: 10/03, Next Test due as mentioned: D10, Tare weight: 16.1 Kg.
Observation: Inspection has been carried out in presence of Sri Malay Kr. Majumdar. During inspection Gross weight found 28.0 kg, hence net weight is 11.9 kg. In naked eye, the leaking liquid from the subject cylinder seems to be water. No LPG except water is found inside while pressuring the valve. Cylinder was out of circulation for around 5 years 5 months and was in custody of the complainant since 30.01.2012. Any tampering of the valve of the cylinder could not be detected in naked eye. Mfg Month/Year of the cylinder is 10/03. Hence “D10” was stamped on the stay plate of the cylinder as per prevalent directives in 2003 as first testing due after 7 years. But as per PESO Circular No.R.4(2) 100/2007 dated 20.08.2007 all new LPG cylinders (manufactured from the second quarter of the year 2000) are required to  be taken for first statutory testing n& painting after 10 years, subsequent testing of all LPG cylinders is done after 5 years. Hence, testing of the cylinder was due on D13, but could not be tested as it was under custody of the customer. Normally all cylinders are tested as per the schedule. No test due cylinders are in circulation in the market.

Shantanu Sinha
Manager (LPG-Sales)
Kolkata-1 Sales Area”
10.     Reading of the above report makes it clear that the liquid leaking from the gas cylinder was water and there was no LPG in the cylinder except water. Thus, the expert report establishes that the gas cylinder was filled with water and there was no LPG in it, as alleged by the Complainant. It is also clear from the report that there was no tempering of the cylinder valve, as submitted by learned Counsel for the Appellant. The submission of learned counsel for the Appellant that no harm was caused to the Complainant, would not absolve the Appellant from the deficiency in service on their part.  The State Commission, therefore, rightly allowed the Complaint.
","11.     In view of the above, deficiency in service on the part of the Appellant is clearly established. I find no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the State Commission. The impugned order passed by the State Commission is perfectly justified and does not warrant interference in appellate jurisdiction. The Appeal fails and is hereby dismissed, with no order as to cost.

  For the Petitioner     :Ms. Deepika Mishra, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Parvinder Chauhan, Advocate. 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The case of the complainant who is the petitioner in RP No. 2173 of 2014 and respondent in RP No. 2160 of 2014 is that she had a savings account with the District Co-operative Bank Ltd., which is petitioner in RP No. 2160 of 2014 and respondent in RP No. 2173 of 2014.  This is also her case that the pass book which the bank had issued to her was deposited by here with the bank manager for security reasons.  When she went to the bank for withdrawing money from her account she was told that the original pass book had been lost.  When she insisted on return of the pass book a new pass book was issued to her which showed a balance of only Rs. 855.35/- in her savings account whereas, she had a credit balance of Rs. 184500/- in her account of 04.08.1992. The complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint, the bank having refused to pay what she claimed to be correct amount lying deposited in her savings account.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the Bank which admitted that the complainant had an account with it.  It was, however, stated in the written version that the complainant was in connivance with one Murlidhar Mishra, who was working as a cashier in the bank and after having withdrawn the money she filed a complaint. It was also stated in the reply that the Bank had terminated the service of Mr. Murlidhar Mishra.
3.      The District Forum partly allowed the complaint and directed the Bank to pay a sum of Rs. 41,031.95/- to the complainant along with interest @ 10% p.a. w.e.f. 15.06.1993 and compensation quantified at Rs.10,000/-.
","4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The Bank also preferred an appeal against the order of the District Forum.  Vide impugned order dated 07.02.2014 the State Commission dismissed both the appeals, thereby maintaining the order passed by the District Forum.  Being aggrieved both the parties are before this Commission.
5.      The case of the Bank is that the complainant is entitled to only a sum of Rs. 855.35/- whereas the submission of the Ld. Counsel for  the complainant is that she is entitled to Rs.103195.15 as per the entries made in the original pass book.   The case of the complainant is thus based upon the original pass book which she claims was lost by the Bank and was later returned to her.  I have perused the pass book which the complainant had filed before the District Forum.  A perusal of the pass book would show that on 08.04.1992 a sum of Rs.50,000/- was deposited in the account thereby increasing the balance to Rs. 115727/-.  Thereafter there was a withdrawal of Rs.40,000/- on the same day thereby reducing the balance to Rs.75723/-.  The pass book further shows that on 04.08.1992 a sum of Rs. 184500/- was credited in the account of the complainant by encashment of a FDR.  If this is so, the balance in the savings account on that day should have been Rs.75723/- + Rs. 184500/- i.e. Rs.2,60,223/-.  On the other hand the pass book shows a balance of Rs.1,08,723/- even after crediting of Rs.184500/-.  Thus the entry made in the pass book is obviously incorrect/false.  The next entry in the pass book shows withdrawal of Rs.2,000/-.  If Rs. 2,000/- are deducted from Rs.108723/- shown as the balance as per the previous entry the remaining correct balance in the account should Rs. 1,06,723/-, but the credit balance shown after deduction of Rs. 2,000/- is Rs.88723/-.  This clearly shows that even the next entry is incorrect/false.
6.      As noted earlier there is a credit entry of Rs.184500/- in the account on 04.08.1992.  The second entry thereafter is dated 28.07.1992.  In fact, if the entries made after 04.04.1992 are carefully seen it is ex-facie evident that the said entries have not been made in a  chronological order.  In a Bank pass book the entries are always made in a chronological order.  Therefore, the entry of the transaction made on an earlier date cannot succeed the entry of the transaction made on a subsequent date.  Similarly, the entry of a later date cannot precede the entry of an earlier date.  From whatever angle I may look at it, there is no escape from the conclusion that the pass book which the complainant filed and relied upon for the purpose of prosecuting her claim is not a true and genuine document and the same appears to be a false and fabricated document.  Even the case of the complainant that she had deposited the pass book with the bank for security reasons cannot be believed, since the account holder would ordinarily keep the pass book with him.  The pass book is not something which anyone would steal.
7.      It is settled legal proposition that a person seeking to approach a court/forum necessarily come with clean hands and disclose all facts favourable or unfavourable to him.  A person who basis his claim on a false statement or on a false document is not entitled to any relief from any court/forum, he having not come with clean hands and having tried to obtain a favourable order on the basis of false and fabricated documents.   Having based her claim on the pass book, which is found to be a fabricated and false document the complainant, in my opinion, is not entitled to any relief irrespective of the merits of her case.  I, therefore, need not examine her case on merits and the consumer complaint is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.
8.     For the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned orders are set aside and the consumer complaint is dismissed with no order as to costs.

IA 8829 of 2018 (condonation of delay)
This Application has been filed by the Appellant along with the Appeal for condonation of delay of about 241 days in filing the Appeal against the order dated 06.04.2017 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab (for short “the State Commission”).  The Appeal was filed on 01.05.2018.  In the Application, it is submitted that the Appellant has a good case on merit.  It is submitted that the delay is inadvertent.  It is submitted that copy of the order dated 06.04.2017 was received on 03.08.2017 and was put up before the dealing assistant on 07.08.2017 for obtaining advice of the legal cell of GMADA.  Thereafter they sent the file to estate officer (housing) on 24.08.2017 which dealt with the case on 28.08.2017 and sought the comments from Chief Engineer, GMADA.  On 05.09.2017, Chief Engineer GMADA prepared its report.  The file was put up thereafter for consideration before the Estate Officer, (Housing) who marked this file to legal cell on 11.09.2017.  The legal branch put up the file to higher authorities of GMADA on 20.10.2017 for taking approval for filing the Appeal.  On 22.11.2017, the Chief Administrator, GMADA gave approval for filing the Appeal.  The sanction thereafter was issued on 08.12.2017.  The sanction was received in the office when the Counsel was not available due to winter vacations and it was handed over to the Counsel only in the first week of January 2018.  Learned Counsel was indisposed due to major surgery of one of the member of her immediate family and could prepare the Appeal only in the last week of March.  The vetted draft along with draft of ₹35,000/- was received by the Counsel in the last week of April and the paper book was made ready on 27.04.2018 and 30.04.2018 being holiday the Appeal was filed thereafter.  It is submitted that the delay had occurred due to these reasons.
2.       I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record.  The Appellant in the application has contended that they had received copy of the order on 03.08.2017.  From the noting of the impugned order which has been placed on record, it is apparent that the free copy was dispatched on 26.07.2017.  The period of limitation for filing the Appeal is 30 days and the Appeal ought to have been filed within 30 days from the date of receiving copy of the impugned order, i.e., by 02.09.2017.  From the contention in the application, it is apparent that till 02.09.2017, the Appellant could not even had decided whether they wanted to Appeal the order.  Their file remained moving from table to table from that date till December 2017, i.e., for 3 months, when according to them the file was sent to the Counsel for preparation of the Appeal.  The authorities, i.e. the member of the legal cell of the Appellant, certainly were aware that the period of limitation is 30 days for filing the Appeal, yet it took them 5 months to reach to the decision of filing the Appeal.  Even on expiry of such long period, no promptness in filing the Appeal has been shown.  The matter remained pending for consideration of the draft with the learned Counsel till May 2018 when the Appeal was filed.  Therefore, for another 5 months, the Appeal draft could not be prepared and the Appeal could not be filed.
3.       It is a settled proposition of law that the condonation of delay is not a matter of right.  The applicant has to give sufficient cause for the delay.  Sufficient cause means adequate or reasonable reasons to show that despite the fact that they remained active and acted diligently, for the reasons beyond their control, the Appeal could not be filed within limitation.  In the case of “R. B. Ramlingam vs. R. B. Bhavaneshwari, I (2009) (2) CLJ (SC) 24” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that where sufficient reasons are not shown, the courts have no discretion but to dismiss the application seeking condonation of delay.  The Hon’ble Apex Court has held as under:
""5. We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
4.       In the case of “Ram Lal and Ors. vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down the principle which should be the guide to determine whether the reasons given are sufficient to condone the delay.  The Hon’ble Court has held as under:
","“12. It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
5.       In the case of “Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, (2011) 14 SCC 578,” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has cautioned this Commissions that they should always keep in mind the special nature of the period of limitation given under the Act.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“5.       It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Fora.""
6.       From the perusal of the contentions in the application enumerating the reasons for condonation of delay, it is apparent that the reasons given for the delay are not of such nature which could show that the Appellants could not have filed the present Appeal within the period of limitation due to circumstances beyond their control.  The delay seems to have occurred because nobody had acted diligently and promptly and the file remained pending due to administrative reasons because of lethargy of its officials.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Post Master vs. Balram Singh Patel Inaram Lodhi, III (2018) CPJ 53 (NC)” has clearly held that government departments must show their promptness and eagerness to ensure that they had performed their duties with diligence and commitment.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“The government departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an anticipated benefit for government departments.’
7.       In the present case, as discussed above, no reasonable and sufficient grounds for condoning the delay of almost more than 200 days have been shown.  The application has no merits.  Consequently, the First Appeal is dismissed in limine.

","These revision petitions have been filed by the petitioner Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. against the separate orders dated 01.04.2019 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab (in short ‘the State Commission’) in Appeal Nos.161 of 2019, 162 of 2019, 163 of 2019 & 164 of 2019 whereby the appeals preferred by the petitioner against the orders of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Sangrur, (in short ‘the District Forum’) passed in Complaint No.38 of 2018, 39 of 2018, 40 of 2018 & 41 of 2018 have been dismissed.
2.      Brief facts of these cases are that due to sparking in the overhead electrical wires, the wheat crop of the respondent complainants got burnt.  Tehsildar inspected the damaged crop and assessed the loss.  Deputy Chief Engineer of the petitioner also inspected and submitted his report wherein sparking has been stated to be a probable cause of fire, however, no definite finding has been given.  The complainants filed consumer complaints before the District Forum being consumer complaint no.38 of 2018, 39 of 2018, 40 of 2018 & 41 of 2018. The District Forum vide its order dated 31.10.2018 allowed the complaints and directed the petitioners/opposite parties to pay a compensation in each case as follows:-
Complaint No.38 of 2018
To pay Rs.1,59,800/- alongwith interest @9% p.a. from the date of filing of the complaint i.e. 02.02.2018 till realisation.  Opposite parties also to pay a consolidated compensation of Rs.10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- as cost of litigation.
Complaint No.39 of 2018, 40 and 41 of 2018
In these complaints only the amount to be paid is different and rest of the order is exactly the same.  In CC No.39 of 2018, the amount to be paid is Rs.59,925/-, in CC No.40 of 2018, this amount is Rs.1,19,850/- and in CC No.41 of 2018, the amount is Rs.1,59,800/-.
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner herein preferred appeals bearing No.161 of 2019, 162 of 2019, 163 of 2019 & 164 of 2019.  The State Commission dismissed the application for condonation of delay filed in each case and consequently dismissed the appeals vide its separate orders dated 01.04.2019.
4.      Hence the present revision petitions.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at admission stage.  Learned counsel argued that after the decision of the District Forum, the petitioner could not get the platform to put-forward their case.  There is no proof that the fire emanated from the spark in wires connecting the poles.  The learned counsel has stated that the report of the Deputy Chief Engineer only mentions that the sparking in the wires may be a probable cause but the same has not been confirmed by the Deputy Chief Engineer or by any other expert.  The District Forum in the absence of any proof has observed that the fire has been caused due to sparking in the overhead wires.  The learned counsel further stated that every year advance warming is given to the farmers through various means that they should not keep their dried crop under the overhead wires. However, these farmers have not complied with advance warming given by the petitioners.  Therefore, the petitioners cannot be held liable to pay any compensation for the negligence on the part of the complainants themselves.  The learned counsel stated that all these points were argued before the State Commission, however, the State Commission has dismissed the appeals filed by the petitioner only on the ground of limitation and no consideration on merits has been made by the State Commission.
6.      It was further argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the delay in filing the appeals had occurred inadvertently as one of the Junior Engineer kept the files for about two months without taking any action on these files.  The petitioner has already taken action against the concerned Junior Engineer. For the fault of one officer of the petitioner department, the whole department should not suffer. Moreover if these orders of the fora below are not set aside, this will create a bad precedent for the department and other farmers may file such cases.  As the real cause of fire is not known and the orders have been passed only on the presumption, there is all likelihood that the other farmers may adopt same tactics to enrich themselves without any real cause.  It was prayed that the orders of the fora below be set aside and the revision petitions be admitted.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and examined the material on record.  It is seen that there has been a delay of about 97 days in filing these appeals by the petitioner before the State Commission against the order of the District Forum.        The limitation of appeal before the State Commission is covered under Section 15 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which reads as under:-
“15. Appeal-  Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Forum may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order, in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period.”
","8.      From the above, it is clear that if the appeal is filed with delay it is the satisfaction of the State Commission that the appeal may be admitted otherwise the same may be rejected on the ground of delay.  In the present case, the State Commission dismissed the applications for condonation of delay as the State Commission was not satisfied with the reasons given in the application for condonation of delay.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in R.B. Ramlingam Vs. R.B. Bhavaneshwari, 2009 (2) Scale 108, has observed:-
“We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition”.
9.     From the above, it is clear that for deciding the aspect of limitation, one has to see whether the applicant has prosecuted his case with reasonable diligence. Clearly in the present case, the files were with Junior Engineer for about two months and no officers of the petitioner department monitored the cases or took steps to file the appeals in time.  Thus, clearly it can be said that the petitioner did not pursue the prosecution of its appeals with reasonable diligence.
10.    From the above, another aspect for condoning the delay is brought out and this relates to the examination of the facts of the case and the decision taken by the trial court.  In the present case, the petitioner has got full opportunity to pursue the case before the District Forum and the case was contested.  Thus, it cannot be said that the petitioner could not get the opportunity to put forward its case/defence.  It is accepted by the petitioner that there was fire in the field of the farmers and the assessment of loss has been made by the competent machinery.  The Deputy Chief Engineer in his report has also agreed that spark from the overhead wires may be the probable cause of fire. These factors have led to the District Forum to give a finding that the fire was caused by the sparking in the overhead electrical wires. So far as the issue of advance warning circulated by the petitioner is concerned, no written document has been filed by the petitioner to prove that such advance notice was ever circulated.  If any campaign was taken up to provide awareness to the farmers in this regard, nothing is available on case file to consider whether any such campaign was taken up by the petitioner.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ram Lal and Ors. Vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361, has observed that even if the delay may be justified and explained, it is not necessary for a court to condone the delay and this will depend on the examination of the facts of the case and the decision of the trial court.  In fact, the judgment reads as under:-
“It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
11.    In my view, the decision of the trial court seems to be in order.  As the occurrence of fire is not denied by the petitioner and the most probable cause of fire seems sparking from the overhead electric wires for whose maintenance the petitioner is responsible and as the compensation has been granted on the basis of the report of the revenue machinery of the State, keeping these factors in mind, I do not consider this to be a fit case for condoning the delay in filing appeals before the State Commission.  Accordingly, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 01.04.2019 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Accordingly, the revision petition Nos.1469 of 2019, 1470 of 2019, 1471 of 2019 & 1472 of 2019 are dismissed at the admission stage.

2.      Late Smt. Rama Sood having died on 20.4.2005, claims for payment in terms of the aforesaid policies were preferred by the complainants, they being her legal representatives.  The claim against the following eight policies stand duly paid:

3.      It would also be seen from Chart-A that policies No. 151280124, 51321656, 51329959, 151329994, 151460678 and 152411383 had lapsed on account of the premium having not been paid.  The policies having lapsed within less than two years, no claim for the aforesaid lapsed policies was payable.  As far as policy No. 150876629 at Sl. No. 18 is concerned, there is no evidence of any premium having been paid after taking the policy and therefore, the aforesaid policy had also lapsed. It was informed by the learned counsel for the Corporation during the course of hearing that the aforesaid policy was taken under Marriage / Education Endowment Plan and the amount which was payable under the said policy, despite its having lapsed stand duly paid.  Therefore, the dispute between the parties is confined to payment in terms of three insurance policies bearing No. 150798290, 152429832, 151612717.
4.      The insurer repudiated the claim against policy No. 150798290, 152429832, 152411383, vide letters dated 06.1.2006, which to the extent they are relevant read as under:

She did not however disclose this fact in her DGH form instead she gave false answers therein as stated above and revived policy fraudulently.
It is therefore evident that he had made deliberate misstatement and withheld material information from us regarding his health at the time of effecting the revival of the policy.

In this connection we have to inform you that in the proposal for Assurance dated 28.1.2004 signed by the deceased, she had answered the following questions as under noted:

(c)     Have you remained absent from place of work on grounds of health during the last five years?   NO
We may, however, state that all these answers were false as we hold indisputable proof to show that before she proposed for the above policy she remained absent from her duties from 18.12.2001 to 11.01.2002 (24 days) for operation ovarian cyst and remained admitted at Doctor Mangla Dogra’s Nagpal Nursing Home, 5/19A Chandigarh from 19.12.2001 to 22.12.2001.

It is therefore evident that he had made deliberate misstatement and withheld material information form us regarding his health at the time of effecting the assurance and in terms of the policy contract and the declaration contained in the forms of proposal for assurance we hereby repudiate the claim and accordingly we are not liable for any payment under the above policy and all moneys that have been paid in consequence thereof belong to us.”

Instead she gave false answers therein as stated above and obtained insurance fraudulently.
It is therefore evident that he had made deliberate misstatement and withheld material information from us regarding his health at the time of effecting the assurance and in terms of the policy contract and the declaration contained in the forms of proposal for assurance.  We hereby repudiate the claim and accordingly we are not liable for any payment under the above policy and all moneys that have been paid in consequence thereof belong to us.”
5.      The claim in terms of polices taken by late Smt. Rama Sood having not been paid, the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint. The complaint was resisted by the Corporation primarily on the grounds on which the claim had been repudiated.  Vide impugned order dated 03.6.2008, the State Commission directed the insurer to pay the sum insured in respect of the above referred three polices bearing No. 150798290, 152429832, 152411383.  Regarding Policy No. 150876629, it was directed that on its maturity, the value along with other benefits like bonus etc., will be paid by the insurer and the complainants were not liable to pay premium thereof.   Interest @ 6% per annum with effect from 01.11.2005 was also awarded to the complainants.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the Corporation is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
6.      Policy No.  150798290
The proposal for taking this policy was signed by Smt. Rama Sood on 31.3.2000.  Admittedly, this policy had lapsed and was later got revived by the deceased insured.  A Declaration Of Good Health form dated 28.5.2002 was submitted by Smt. Rama Sood.  Vide Question No. 2(b) contained in the said form she was asked as to whether she had undergone any operation or injury.  The answer given by her was in negative, she having written ‘No” while responding to the question.  The Corporation has filed a certificate issued by Dr. Mangla Dogra, Formerly of PGI Chandigarh, whereby she has certified that Smt. Rama Sood was hospitalized from 19.12.2001 and was discharged on 22.12.2001, after LAVH c  (with) BSO was done on 20.12.2001.  It is also stated in the said certificate that the patient was having excess bleeding during past six months and was diagnosed to be having an Ovarian Cyst.  The certificate also shows that as per her histopathology report the cyst was benign.  The aforesaid certificate was duly proved by Dr. Mangla Dogra by way of her affidavit dated 16.2.2006 filed before the State Commission.
7.      It would thus be seen that a false Declaration Of Good Health was made by Smt. Rama Sood while obtaining renewal of this policy, she having concealed material information that she had undergone a surgery at a hospital on 20.12.2001.   It was submitted by the learned counsel for the complainant that the cyst removed during the surgery was found to be benign and not malignant and therefore, had no impact on the health of the insured.  This to my mind would be irrelevant since a contract of insurance being based on utmost good faith she was required to disclose while submitting the declaration, that she had undergone a surgery for removal of a cyst on 20.12.2001 though, she could have also stated that the said cyst was found to be benign.  It would then have been for the Corporation to decide whether considering her past surgery, the policy could be revived or not.
8.      Coming to Policy No. 152429832, in the proposal form submitted by the insured on 28.1.2004 much after she had undergone a surgery for removal of a cyst, she was required to disclose against question No. 11(b) whether she had been admitted to any hospital or nursing home for general checkup, observation, treatment or operation  The answer given by her was in negative. Thus, she concealed the surgery which had been performed much earlier on 20.12.2001.
In response to question 9(c) she was required to disclose whether she had remained absent from her place of work on grounds of health during the last five years.  The answer given by her was in negative.  However, the evidence produced before the State Commission shows that she was absent from her duty for as many as twenty days from 18.12.2001 to 11.1.2002 and had admitted in Dr. Mangla Dogra’s Nagpal Nursing Home from 19.12.2001 to 22.12.2001.  Thus she also concealed the fact of having taken leave on medical grounds.  Obviously this was done in order to conceal the surgery which she had undergone on 20.12.2001.
9.      Coming to policy No. 151612717, in the proposal form dated 16.8.2004 submitted by her the deceased insured while replying to question No. 11(b) and 11(c) concealed that she had been admitted in Dr. Mangla Dogra’s Nagpal Nursing Home for removal of cyst and that she had remain absent on ground of health from 18.12.2001 to 11.1.2002.
In reply to question 9 she was also required to disclose the previous insurance policies.  She disclosed four insurance policies but did not disclose policies number 130405172, 150100344, 152336677, 152372724, 150798290, 152400755, 151280124, 151399959, 152429832 and 151460678.
10.    I may also note here that as per the health record of deceased Smt. Rama Sood produced by the Medical Officer, CSK H.P., Krishi Vishwa Vidalaya, Palampur, where the deceased was employed as a Nurse, she was suffering from Myalgia for four days from 16.8.1999 to 19.8.1999, from Gastro-enteritis for five days from 26.3.2001 to 30.3.2001 from Osteo-arthritis for ten days from 16.4.2001 to 25.4.2001, from Myalgia from 16.1.2002 to 19.1.2002.  From 13.9.2004 to 15.9.2004, she was suffering from acute acid peptic disease.  She had also taken leave due to her operation from 18.12.2001 to 11.01.2002.
11.    It is thus evident that the deceased had conceded material fact with respect to she having undergone surgery on 20.12.2001, she having taken frequent leave on medical grounds in last five years before submission of the proposals and in one proposal she had also concealed several other insurance policies, which she had already taken.  It was her boundant duty to disclose truthfully, honestly and clearly the entire information sought by the insurer in the proposal form since it is based upon the information provided in the proposal form that the insurer decides whether to accept the proposal or not.  The same would be the position when a good health declaration is submitted for obtaining the renewal of a lapsed policy.
12.    In LIC of India Vs. Manish Gupta – Civil Apeal No.3944 of 2019, decided on 15.04.2019, the proposal form required a disclosure as to whether the proposer had suffered from Cardiovascular disease, he responded in negative to the said question. The complainant underwent a surgery, submitted a claim which was repudiated on the ground that she was suffering from a pre-existing illness. Upholding the repudiation of the claim, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia held as under:-
“Moreover, non-disclosure of any health event is specifically set out as a ground for excluding the liability of the insurer.”
“A contract of insurance involves utmost good faith. In Satwant Kaur Sandhu Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd., this Court has held thus:
“...Thus, it needs little emphasis that when an information on a specific aspect is asked for in the proposal form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within his knowledge. It is not for the proposer to determine whether the information sought for is material for the purpose of the policy or not. Of course, obligation to disclose extends only to facts which are known to the applicant and not to what he ought to have known. The obligation to disclose necessarily depends upon the knowledge one possesses. His opinion of the materiality of that knowledge is of no moment.”
……….The documentary material indicates that there was a clear failure on the part of the respondent to disclose that he had suffered from rheumatic heart disease since childhood. The ground for repudiation was in terms of the exclusions contained in the policy. The failure of the insured to disclose the past history of cardiovascular disease was a valid ground for repudiation.”
13.     In Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod – Civil Appeal No.4261 of 2019, decided on 24.4.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia observed as under:-
“26.    …………..It is standard practice for the insurer to set out in the application a series of specific questions regarding the applicant's health history and other matters relevant to insurability. The object of the proposal form is to gather information about a potential client, allowing the insurer to get all information which is material to the insurer to know in order to assess the risk and fix the premium for each potential client. Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries. This allows the parties to serve their interests better and understand the true extent of the contractual agreement.
The finding of a material misrepresentation or concealment in insurance has a significant effect upon both the insured and the insurer in the event of a dispute. The fact it would influence the decision of a prudent insurer in deciding as to whether or not to accept a risk is a material fact. As this Court held in Satwant Kaur (supra) “there is a clear presumption that any information sought for in the proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurane”. Each representation or statement may be material to the risk. The insurance company may still offer insurance protection on altered terms.
29.     We are not impressed with the submission that the proposer was unaware of the contents of the form that he was required to fill up or that in assigning such a response to a third party, he was absolved of the consequence of appending his signatures to the proposal. The proposer duly appended his signature to the proposal form and the grant of the insurance cover was on the basis of the statements contained in the proposal form.  …………..”
14.    The deceased insured being an educated person and a Nurse by profession cannot even claim that the proposal form was submitted by her without going through its contents, though even such a defence is otherwise not legally sustainable.
","15.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside.  The consumer complaint is consequently dismissed, with no order as to costs.
Both FA/318/2008 stands allowed, whereas FA/53/2009 stands dismissed in terms of this order.

The present revision petition has been filed by the petitioner / complainant against the Order of the State Commission dated 27.09.2016, whereby the appeal of the respondent no. 2 was allowed and the order of the District Forum dated 24.05.2016 in complaint no. 173/2015 of the petitioner / complainant was set aside. The District Forum vide its Order dated 24.05.2016 had allowed the complaint and vide impugned Order, the State Commission had dismissed the complaint on the ground that since at the time of the accident, the insured / deceased / husband of the petitioner was not having a valid driving license, it amounts to violation of the terms and conditions of the policy and hence not entitled to get any relief.
2.      The brief facts of the case are that the husband of the petitioner / complainant had taken ‘The Group Personal Accident Policy’ from the respondent. During the validity of the said policy, he met with an accident and unfortunately succumbed to the injuries received by him in the accident. FIR No. 603/2014 was also recorded and the post-mortem was also conducted upon him.  The petitioner / complainant, being wife of the insured, filed a claim before the respondent no. 2 and the respondent no. 2 vide repudiation letter dated 25.02.2015, repudiated the claim on the ground that the deceased was not having a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident.
3.      Before the District Forum, the petitioner / complainant did not produce the copy of any driving license of the deceased nor had produced any document from the RTO to prove that the deceased was having a valid driving license at the time of accident. In appeal filed by the respondent no. 2 before the State Commission, the petitioner / complainant had an opportunity to file the relevant documents to prove that the deceased was having a valid driving license, but no such document was filed by the petitioner. After re-appreciation of the evidences, the State Commission has clearly observed that driving the vehicle without a valid driving license amounts to violation of the terms and conditions of the policy and hence the respondents had rightly repudiated the claim.
4.      Before this Commission, during the pendency of the present revision petition, opportunities were given to the petitioner / complainant to produce the driving license, but no copy of the driving license had been produced by the petitioner / complainant despite taking number of adjournments over the period. The fact remains that the petitioner had failed to discharge the burden of proving the fact that the insured was the holder of a valid driving license at the time of the accident.
","5.      In view of the above observation, it is apparent that the impugned order does not suffer from any illegality and perversity. The revision petition has no merit and the same is dismissed.

1.  This Revision Petition No.665 of 2020 seeks setting aside the impugned judgment and order dated 06.2.2020 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Jaipur, Rajasthan (State Commission hereafter) in Appeal No.625 of 2018.  Vide this order, the State Commission, finding nothing wrong in the order dated 10.7.2018 of the District Forum, had dismissed the appeal.  In turn, the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Jaipur (District Forum hereafter), after hearing the parties and on the basis of evidence, had partly accepted the Consumer Complaint No.230/2015 (Old Case No.41/2015) vide the following order:
“Therefore, the present petition filed by the petitioners is being partly accepted and it is ordered to opposite party to jointly and separately pay petitioners an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (in words Rupees Two Lakh Only) with simple interest of 9% p.a. from date of filing this petition on 17.12.14.  Alongwith this, petitioners are also entitled to get Rs.2500 (Rs. Two thousand five hundred) as compensation for mental harassment and Rs.2500/- (Rs.Two thousand five hundred) as legal cost.  A period of one month is being granted for compliance of this order.  In case of not(non) compliance of this order in granted period, petitioners will be entitled to get simple interest of 9% p.a. on compensation for mental harassment and legal cost amount from today, the date of this order.”
(Ad verbatim from record)
2.      This revision petition has been filed with I.A. No.4819 of 2020, an application seeking condonation of delay in filing of this revision petition.  For the reasons put forth in the application, delay is condoned and this revision is taken on record.
3.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners.
4.      Very briefly, the facts in this case are that respondent/complainant (complainant hereafter) had executed an allotment deed/agreement on 16.06.2007 for Rs.25,96,600/- consideration for a villa booked by them earlier.  The amount was to be paid in installments.  The complainant took possession of their Villa no.111 on 15.09.2010 after paying the full amount to the petitioners/OPs (OP hereafter).  Subsequently, when the complainant sought ‘no dues certificate’ from the OP on 21.10.2013 for transfer of the villa in favour of Mr. Ramdulare, he was shown total receipts issued by the OP of Rs.26,93,931.77, with current dues as zero.  When the complainant requested for documents related to the villa for transfer to Sh. Ramdulare, the OP sought payment of Rs.2,00,000/-.  It was the case of the complainant that this payment was made by him under duress. The amount so collected was therefore illegal, a deficiency in service and an unfair trade practice.  He therefore filed a consumer complaint with the District Forum which partly allowed the complaint vide order dated 10.7.2018 (supra).  On appeal, the State Commission agreed with the reasoning of the District Forum, and finding no merit in the appeal, dismissed the same. Hence, this revision petition.
5.      Learned counsel, appearing for the petitioner/OP, submitted that his main pleas were (i) that the District Forum had committed an error of jurisdiction in admitting and deciding the consumer complaint; and (ii) that the complainant, after having paid Rs.2 lakh without any protest, and after all consequential actions viz-a-viz transfer of documents and the property in the name of Sh. Ramdulare was over, was estopped from pursuing this matter before the consumer fora.  Elaborating, counsel submitted that the jurisdictional issue had been raised before the District Forum as well as the State Commission.  However, both had failed to consider it.  He also argued that the complainant was not a consumer under section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  The reason was that it was very clear from the record that the complainant had bought the villa for resale to earn profit and not for his residential purpose.
6.      Having heard the counsel and carefully perused the record, I am inclined to agree with the concurrent orders of the State Commission and the District Forum.
7.      I find that the District Forum has reasoned cogently, on the basis of submissions and evidence, that prior to the issue of no dues certificate dated 23.10.2013, Rs. 1,77,999.29 had been taken by the OP on account of ‘holding charges’.  If so, there was no case for the OP to have sought payment of another Rs.2 lakh at the time the complainant had sought transfer of documents to Sh. Ramdulare, on account of holding charges.  This was, on the face of it, incorrect. No fault can be found in the orders of the District Forum and the State Commission, on this ground.
8.      Learned counsel for the OP has raised the issue of jurisdiction arguing that as the value of villa was over Rs. 26 lakh and as the pecuniary jurisdiction of the District Forum was limited to Rs.20 Lakh, this consumer complaint could not have been entertained by the District Forum.  He submits that this issue had been raised before the District Forum as well as the the State Commission but was ignored.  It is true that jurisdictional issue can be raised at any stage of any proceeding.  It is not therefore incorrect for this issue to be raised before the National Commission in this RP.  Proceeding further, it is clear, from a plain reading of the orders of the State Commission and the District Forum, that they have noted the issue of jurisdiction raised in their respective orders but have not given any explicit finding in the matter.  From this, it is clear that the District Forum and the State Commission have, by inference, taken the value of the consumer complaint to be Rs.2 Lakh.  The question therefore is: was this a gross error in law? Not so, in my considered view. The reason for this is that the entire transaction of over Rs.20 lakh was over and done with, with possession taken and transferred to Ramdulare by the original allotee/complainant. The consumer complaint, therefore, was not about the villa any more.  Rather, the complaint was about the unfair trade practice of the OP in having demanded Rs.2 lakh at the time when the complainant was left with no option but to comply. This was so because he had to complete the transaction of sale and could not possibly have allowed the same to hinge on Rs 2 lakh. It is this that was the subject of the complaint, not the villa.  Therefore, the jurisdictional error argued by the learned counsel does not sustain.
9.      The second issue raised by the counsel was that having accepted payment of Rs.2 lakh, without protest, the complainant was estopped from approaching the consumer fora. This logic cannot sustain in the facts of the case.  The imperative of completing the transaction of sale would preclude any protest from the complainant for a relatively small amount of Rs. 2 lakh. This would not mean that it had been made without protest and permit invoking of estoppel. The facts make it clear that it was under duress. Thus, the complainant’s right to approach the consumer forum for redressal was not barred by the principle of estoppel.
10.    Third argument raised was that the complainant was not a consumer because it was clear that he had bought the villa only to sell and make a profit. This argument fails in two ways. One, sec 2(1)(d) of the CPA 1986  defines a consumer as a person who buys any goods or hires or avails of services for a consideration but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose or who avails of such servicers for any commercial purpose. The important provision is “for any commercial purpose”.  Law in this regard has been laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court, (1995) 3 SCC 583, in the case of Laxmi Engineering Works vs. P.S.G. Industrial Institute: it has been held that whether or not buying of a good or availing of a service is for a commercial purpose is a question of fact and has to decided in the facts and circumstances of the case. In the instant case, the complainant has made an averment that he was selling the villa for personal reasons. This does not make his purchase of the villa a purchase for commercial purpose. Two, commercial purpose would have to be established; OP would have to show that the complainant was in the business of sale and resale of property. No such averment however is on record or agued. A person can buy a flat and sell it for various reasons. Simply because he sold it does not prove anything. It could never be seriously contended that just because a person has bought a property, and had to sell it, for whatever reason, he would stand debarred from the consumer forum.
11.    Finally, law on revisional powers has been clearly laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. 2011 (3) Scale 654, as under:
“Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b)of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
","12.    In view of the discussion above, this Revision Petition, after consideration, is dismissed at the stage of admission.

","R.K. AGRAWAL,  J. PRESIDENT
1.       This Consumer Complaint, under Section 21(a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”), has been filed by the Complainants against M/s. Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “the Developer”), seeking the following reliefs:-
(a)     to direct the Opposite Party to refund the entire amount of ₹3,22,18,954/- collected from the Complainants towards the consideration of the house along with interest @ 18% p.a. on the amount paid by them from the date of collection of the amounts till it is actually returned to the Complainants;
(b)     to direct the Opposite Party to pay a sum of ₹75,000/- (Rupees Seventy Five Thousand only) to the Complainants towards the cost of litigation;
(c)     Any other order(s) as may be deemed fit and appropriate may also kindly be passed;
2.       The brief facts as set out in the Complaint are that on 22.11.2011, the Complainants applied for a house in the Pioneer Group Housing Project called “Araya” to be developed by the Opposite Party Developer in Sector 62, Gurgaon, Haryana, by paying an booking amount of ₹30,00,000/-. The Apartment Buyer’s Agreement was executed between the parties on 07.03.2012 and the Complainants were allotted   Unit No.1202 A, Floor 13, Tower C admeasuring super area of approx. 3498 Sq. Ft. in the said housing Project, for a total consideration of ₹3,45,22,779/-. The total sale consideration was to be paid as per Payment Plan given in the Buyer’s Agreement.
3.       It is averred in the Compliant that as per Clause 11.2 of the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement dated 07.03.2012, the Developer was under an obligation to make all efforts to apply for the Occupation Certificate of the proposed residential Project within thirty nine (39) months from the date of excavation i.e. by October 2015. The Developer was also entitled to a grace period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, after expiry of the said 39 months period for applying and obtaining the requisite Occupancy Certificate in respect of the said Housing Complex. The demand for the start of excavation was raised by the Opposite Party and was duly paid by the Complainants in June, 2012 and as such, the possession of the allotted Unit was to be handed over to the Complainants by October, 2015.
4.       It is stated by the Complainants that they have regularly visited the site but they were utter surprised and shocked to see that the construction was never in progress. The entire site was seemed to be an abandoned piece of land with semi constructed structure. Even, no one was present on the site to address their queries about the completion of construction. According to them, till 16.12.2015 they had paid a sum of ₹3,22,18,954/- out of the total consideration of ₹3,45,22,779/- i.e. almost 95% of the total Consideration towards the cost of the apartment. Howe-ver, the Developer has failed to deliver the possession of the Unit, complete in all respect, even after expiry of a long period of approx. five years despite repeated requests and remedies over letters, email, phone calls and personal visits.
5.       It is further stated in the Complaint that the Complainants were forced to sign the one-sided Flat Buyer Agreement in the year 2012 on the dotted lines; as per Clause 11.5 of the Buyer’s Agreement, the Developer has agreed to pay to the Complainants a compensation @₹10/- per sq. ft. per month for the period of delay in handing over possession. But, if it is calculated in terms of financial charges, it comes to approximate @1.4% p.a. rate of interest and even these charges are to be paid after 39 months which is period for completion of construction. This shows that the Developer has found a cheap source of funding the Commercial Projects from the hard earned savings of the Complainants. The Complainants have lost all faith in the Project of the Developer and they want refund of the deposited amount with interest and reasonable compensation. As per Clause 6.3 (ii) of the Buyer’s Agreement, the Developer was charging interest @ 18% from the Purchasers for delay in payment of any of the instalments and as such on parity and equity they are liable to pay interest @18% p.a. on refund of the deposited amount.
06.     Hence, alleging deficiency in service on the part of the Developer in not completing the construction of the Project in time and not handing over the possession within the prescribed time as per Apartment Buyer’s Agreement dated 07.03.2012, the Complainants filed the present Complaint seeking aforesaid reliefs.
7.       Upon notice, the Complaint has been contested by the Opposite Party, Developer, by filing its Written Statement, raising preliminary objections that the real motive of instituting this Complaint by the Complainants is to seek more than the contractual benefits from the Developer and that the Complainants were expecting high speculative gains from the booked Unit, but failed due to depressed Real Estate market.
8.       On merits, it is contended that the time of 45 months (including grace period) from the date of excavation, to deliver the possession of the Unit, was tentative and the delay in handing over possession has been purely on account of Force Majeure factors which are as under:-
(i)                Delay in payments by many Customers:- The most important factor in the delay of the Project is that the Complainants have not adhered to the payment schedule and the Developer waived off the option to cancel the Agreement for non-payment; in terms of Clauses 5, 6 and 23 of the Agreement, the Developer was entitled to forfeit the earnest money or to cancel/terminate the agreement in case there was any fault on the part of the Complainants to fulfil the terms and conditions of the agreement, however, the Developer has not exercised this option in the interest of customers;
(ii)     Dispute with Contractors:- The contract to complete the construction of the towers (Structural and Finishing Works) within 30 months, was given to M/s. Urban Ecoinfra Pvt. Ltd. However, as the progress of the work was very slow, the contract was foreclosed and terminated when the Contractor had left behind half of the work.
(iii)    Labour and Water Shortage: There was also shortage of labour and water in the NCR Region which affected the construction directly.
(iv)    Lack of Infrastructural support from State Government:- Despite payment of External Development Charges, the State Government did not provide the basic amenities such as drinking water, sewerage, drainage including storm water line, road etc. in time.
(v)     Storage of Raw Material:-  The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 08.05.2009, suspended all the mining operations in the Aravalli Hill range falling in the State of Haryana which led to a situation of scarcity of the sand and other raw materials for the construction.
(vi)    Delay in approvals by the State Government:-  There was a substantial delay on the part of the Government Departments in granting approval/sanctions for which the Developer cannot be held solely responsible.
(vi)    Jat Reservation Agitation:- The Jat Reservation Agitation in February, 2016 paralyzed the Construction activities badly in the State of Haryana. The instant stoppage of work on the fear of riots and remobilization of work force took considerable time of 3-4 months.
(vii)   NGT Order:- In compliance with the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, all the development/construction activities were stopped by the Developer in April 2015 and November, 2016 due to emission of dust and unprecedented pollution.
(viii)   Demonetization of Rs.500/- and Rs.1000/- currency notes:- On 8th November, 2016, the Government of India demonetized the currency notes of Rs.500/ and Rs.1000/- due to which there was crunch of funds for the material and labour for 4 to 5 months.
09.     It is further submitted that as the delay in completing the Project was due to the reasons beyond their control, the prayer by the  Complainants for refund of the deposited amount is not tenable and even if, the Complainants are entitled for refund, they would not ask for interest for the time period between the last date of payment and date of filing of Complaint.  It is strenuously stated that the parties are bound by the terms of contract and entitled to a compensation, if any, in terms of the contract only.  Further, for refund and compensation, the Complainants have to adhere to the provisions made in Clause 11.5 of the Agreement.
10.     All other averments made in the Complaint have been specifically denied by the Developer and prayed dismissal of the Complaint with exemplary costs. The Complainants filed their Rejoinder denying all the rival contentions raised by the Opposite Party in its Reply and reiterating the averments made in the Complaint.
11.     We have heard the Learned Counsel for the parties at some length and also perused the material available on record as well as the Written Arguments.
12.     In brief, it is the Complainants’ case that they booked the Unit No.1202A, 13th Floor, Tower C admeasuring 3489 sq. ft. and the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement with regard to the said Unit was executed between the parties on 07.03.12. In terms of Clause 11.2 of the Agreement, the Developer was committed to deliver the possession of the Apartment to the Complainants, complete in all respect, within 39 months from the date of excavation with grace period of 180 days.  Admittedly, the excavation started on 04.06.2012. The construction, therefore, ought to have been completed and the Developer ought to have applied for Occupancy Certificate on or before 04.09.2015. However, till date, the possession of the booked Unit has not been offered by the Developer despite making 95% payment of the total consideration till December, 2015.
13.     In support of his case, Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainants has placed reliance on the decision dated 23.10.2018 rendered by a Coordinate Bench of this Commission in Consumer Complaint No. 238 of 2017 (Mrs. Geetu Gidwani Verma Vs. Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. And  Consumer Complaint Nos. 239 of 2017 (Mr. Govindan Raghavan Vs. Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd.) which relates to the same Project, i.e. “The Araya”. We find that the defence taken by the Developer in the present Complainant is more or less similar to that taken in the abovesaid Consumer Complaints. While dealing with the similar reasons taken by the Developer for delay in handing over the possession in the afore referred Complaints, the Coordinate Bench of this Commission has observed as under:-
“3.      The complaints have been resisted by the OP which had admitted the allotment made to the complainants as well as the payment received from them.  It is inter-alia stated in the written version filed by the OP that the construction could not be completed within the stipulated time on account of reasons beyond its control.  The said reasons, according to the OP, are as under:
(a) The delay on the part of several flat buyers in making timely payment, (b) the dispute of the developer with the contractor, (c) shortage of water, (d) Lack of infrastructural support from the State Government, (e) Shortage of raw material, (f) Delay in approvals, (g) Jat reservation agitation, (h) NGT order stopping construction and (i) Demonetization of the currency.
4.      As far as the delay on the part of the several flat buyers is concerned, admittedly, the OP had a right to cancel the allotment due to the alleged non-payments.  After cancelling the allotments made to the defaulting customers, the OP could have sold those flats in the open market to other willing buyers.  Having not exercised the right available to it, to cancel the allotment on account of the alleged non-payment, the OP, in my view, cannot deny refund and compensation to the flat buyers who have been making payments in time or from whom interest for delay in payment has been charged.  Therefore, I find no merit in the aforesaid ground.
xxxxxx
6.      As far as the alleged dispute with the contractor is concerned, the case of the OP is that initially, the work was awarded to M/s Urban Eco Infra Pvt. Ltd. which did not maintain the assured timeline and therefore, the OP took over the construction work from the said contactor and awarded the same to another contractor M/s Leighton Contractors Pvt. Ltd.  In my view, the dispute if any, between OP and the contractor engaged by it, cannot justify the delay in completion of the construction. If the OP suffers any loss or has to pay compensation/damages on account of the delay committed by the contractor engaged by it, it will be entitled to avail such remedy as may be available to it in law against the contractor responsible for the delay, but it cannot deny refund and a fair compensation to a flat buyer who does not wish to wait any more for the possession of the alleged flat and wants refund of the money paid by him alongwith compensation.
7.      As far as the alleged water shortage and labour shortage is concerned, there is no evidence on record to prove that no water or labour was actually available in the market at the relevant time to carry out construction.  The delay cannot be justified on such bald allegations without substantiating the same by hard evidence showing actual non-availability of water and labour in the market.
8.      As far as the alleged delay on the part of the Government agencies in laying infrastructure is concerned, there is no evidence of any particular timeline having been committed by such agencies to the developer for laying infrastructure and having not maintained the said timeline.  As far as the alleged shortage of raw material is concerned, the case of the OP is that sand was not available in the vicinity of the complex due to restriction on mining imposed in Aravali region and therefore, they had to procure sand from the neighbouring city of Rajasthan.  In its written version, the OP has referred to an order dated 08.05.2009 stated to have been passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court stopping the mining operations in Aravali range.  The agreement with the complainant having been executed much much later on 04.06.2012, the said order was already in the knowledge of the developer and therefore, it knew that it will have to procure sand from other places, on account of mining having been stopped in Aravali region.  Therefore, shortage of sand in Aravali region cannot be a good ground for delaying the construction.
9.      As regards the delay in grant of approvals from the State Government is concerned, neither any particulars of the alleged delay have been given nor any evidence has been led to prove that there was abnormal delay on the part of Government Authorities in granting approval and the said delay had contributed to the delay in completion of the construction.
10.    As regards the Jat reservation agitation, there is no evidence of the said agitation having actually resulted in stoppage of work at the site of the project.  More importantly, the aforesaid protest is stated to have started in February 2016 whereas the construction was required to be completed by September 2015, much before the said agitation started in Gurgaon.
11.    As regards NGT having stopped construction in April 2015 and November 2016, no order of NGT passed in April 2015 and stopping construction on the project in question has been placed on record.  As far as the order of NGT dated 08.11.2016 is concerned, that came to be passed much later than the last date stipulated in the Buyers Agreement for completion of the construction.  Moreover, the said order was operative only for a period of one week.
12.    As far as demonetization is concerned, I fail to appreciate how it could have affected the construction since there was no restriction on payment by means of cheques/ demand drafts and through other modes of banking transactions.  Moreover, the demonetization came to force on 08.11.2016, much after the last date stipulated for completion of the construction had already expired.”
14.     With regard to Clause 11.5 of the Agreement upon which the reliance has been placed by the Developer for refund and compensation payable to the Complainants, the Coordinate Bench referring to another decision of this Commission in Consumer Complaint No.2000 of 2016 – Geeta Bansal Vs. M/s. Ireo Grace Realtech Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. – decided on 24.09.2018, has held that such a Clause is wholly one sided and unfair and, therefore, the Complainants would not be bound by the same. If the Developer is unable to justify the delay, this Commission would be competent to direct refund of the amount paid by them to the Developer along with appropriate compensation.
","15.     At this juncture, it is pertinent to mention that Civil Appeal Nos. 12238 of 2018 and 1677 of 2019 were filed by the Developer, Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the Coordinate Bench of this Commission in Geetu Gidwani’s case (Supra). Vide order, dated 02.04.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India affirmed the finding returned by this Commission and dismissed the Civil Appeals with the following observations :-
“6. We have heard the learned Counsel for both the parties, and perused the pleadings, and written submissions filed.
6.1. In the present case, admittedly the Appellant - Builder obtained the Occupancy Certificate almost 2 years after the date stipulated in the Apartment Buyer's Agreement. As a consequence, there was a failure to hand over possession of the flat to the Respondent - Flat Purchaser within a reasonable period. The Occupancy Certificate was obtained after a delay of more than 2 years on 28.08.2018 during the pendency of the proceedings before the National Commission.
In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta – (1994) 1 SCC 243, this Court held that when a person hires the services of a builder, or a contractor, for the construction of a house or a flat, and the same is for a consideration, it is a ""service"" as defined by Section 2 (o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The inordinate delay in handing over possession of the flat clearly amounts to deficiency of service.
In Fortune Infrastructure and Anr. v. Trevor D'Lima and Ors., (2018) 5 SCC 442 , this Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the flat allotted to him, and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid by him, along with compensation.
6.2. The Respondent - Flat Purchaser has made out a clear case of deficiency of service on the part of the Appellant - Builder. The Respondent - Flat Purchaser was justified in terminating the Apartment Buyer's Agreement by filing the Consumer Complaint, and cannot be compelled to accept the possession whenever it is offered by the Builder. The Respondent - Purchaser was legally entitled to seek refund of the money deposited by him along with appropriate compensation.
6.3. The National Commission in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 held that the Clauses relied upon by the Builder were wholly one-sided, unfair and unreasonable, and could not be relied upon.
The Law Commission of India in its 199th Report, addressed the issue of 'Unfair (Procedural & Substantive) Terms in Contract'. The Law Commission inter-alia recommended that a legislation be enacted to counter such unfair terms in contracts. In the draft legislation provided in the Report, it was stated that:
“  A contract or a term thereof is substantively unfair if such contract or the term thereof is in itself harsh, oppressive or unconscionable to one of the parties.”
6.4. A perusal of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 08.05.2012 reveals stark incongruities between the remedies available to both the parties. For instance, Clause 6.4 (ii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant - Builder to charge Interest @18% p.a. on account of any delay in payment of installments from the Respondent - Flat Purchaser.
Clause 6.4 (iii) of the Agreement entitles the Appellant - Builder to cancel the allotment and terminate the Agreement, if any installment remains in arrears for more than 30 days.
On the other hand, as per Clause 11.5 of the Agreement, if the Appellant - Builder fails to deliver possession of the apartment within the stipulated period, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser has to wait for a period of 12 months after the end of the grace period, before serving a Termination Notice of 90 days on the Appellant-Builder, and even thereafter, the Appellant - Builder gets 90 days to refund only the actual installment paid by the Respondent - Flat Purchaser, after adjusting the taxes paid, interest and penalty on delayed payments. In case of any delay thereafter, the Appellant-Builder is liable to pay Interest @9% p.a. only.
6.5.   Another instance is Clause 23.4 of the Agreement which entitles the Appellant - Builder to serve a Termination Notice upon the Respondent - Flat Purchaser for breach of any contractual obligation. If the Respondent - Flat Purchaser fails to rectify the default within 30 days of the Termination Notice, then the Agreement automatically stands cancelled, and the Appellant -Builder has the right to forfeit the entire amount of Earnest Money towards liquidated damages.
On the other hand, as Clause 11.5 (v) of the Agreement, if the Respondent - Flat Purchaser fails to exercise his right of termination within the time limit provided in Clause 11.5, then he shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement thereafter, and shall be bound by the provisions of the Agreement.
6.6. Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines 'unfair trade practices' in the following words:
""'unfair trade practice' means a trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice..."", and includes any of the practices enumerated therein. The provision is illustrative, and not exhaustive.
In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Ors. v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Ors., : (1986) 3 SCC 156, this Court held that:
89. ... Our judges are bound by their oath to 'uphold the Constitution and the laws'. The Constitution was enacted to secure to all the citizens of this country social and economic justice. Article 14 of the Constitution guarantees to all persons equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. This principle is that the courts will not enforce and will, when called upon to do so, strike down an unfair and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and unreasonable Clause in a contract, entered into between parties who are not equal in bargaining power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No court can visualize the different situations which can arise in the affairs of men. One can only attempt to give some illustrations. For instance, the above principle will apply where the inequality of bargaining power is the result of the great disparity in the economic strength of the contracting parties. It will apply where the inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the creation of the parties or not. It will apply to situations in which the weaker party is in a position in which he can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or go without them. It will also apply where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or to accept a set of Rules as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a Clause in that contract or form or Rules may be. This principle, however, will not apply where the bargaining power of the contracting parties is equal or almost equal. This principle may not apply where both parties are businessmen and the contract is a commercial transaction. ... These cases can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court must judge each case on its own facts and circumstances.
(Emphasis supplied)
6.7. A term of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat purchasers had no option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the builder.
The contractual terms of the Agreement dated 08.05.2012 are ex-facie one-sided, unfair, and unreasonable. The incorporation of such one-sided clauses in an agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of selling the flats by the Builder.
7. In view of the above discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the terms of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 08.05.2012 were wholly one-sided and unfair to the Respondent-Flat Purchaser. The Appellant - Builder could not seek to bind the Respondent with such one-sided contractual terms.
8. We also reject the submission made by the Appellant - Builder that the National Commission was not justified in awarding Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. for the period commencing from the date of payment of each installment, till the date on which the amount was paid, excluding only the period during which the stay of cancellation of the allotment was in operation.
In Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank, : (2007) 6 SCC 711, a Coordinate Bench of this Court held that when possession of the allotted plot/flat/house is not delivered within the specified time, the allottee is entitled to a refund of the amount paid, with reasonable Interest thereon from the date of payment till the date of refund.
8.1. In the present case, the National Commission has passed an equitable Order. The Commission has not awarded any Interest for the period during which the Order of stay of cancellation of the allotment was in operation on the request of the Respondent - Flat Purchaser.
The National Commission has rightly awarded Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. by applying Rule 15 of the Haryana Real Estate (Regulation And Development) Rules, 2017 from the date of each installment till 05.02.2017 i.e. till the date after which the Order of stay of cancellation of the allotment was passed; and thereafter, from the date of the Commission's final Order till the date on which the amount is refunded with Interest.
9. We see no illegality in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Commission. The Appellant-Builder failed to fulfil his contractual obligation of obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and offering possession of the flat to the Respondent - Purchaser within the time stipulated in the Agreement, or within a reasonable time thereafter. The Respondent - Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession of the flat, even though it was offered almost 2 years after the grace period under the Agreement expired. During this period, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser had to service a loan that he had obtained for purchasing the flat, by paying Interest @10% to the Bank. In the meanwhile, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser also located an alternate property in Gurugram. In these circumstances, the Respondent-Flat Purchaser was entitled to be granted the relief prayed for i.e. refund of the entire amount deposited by him with Interest.”
16.     Hence, it is manifest that the aforesaid judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court squarely applies to the facts and circumstances of the present case. Respectfully following the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, we allow the present Complaint and direct the Opposite Party Developer to refund the principal amount with compensation in the form of simple interest @9% p.a. from the respective dates of deposit till the date of realization together with costs of ₹25,000/- to be paid to the Complainants. The interest @9% p.a. has been awarded in the light of the observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in a catena of judgments awarding interest keeping in view the current market situation and that the Banks have lowered the interest rates and also considering the recent downtrend in the rates of interest and the erosion in the values of real estate in the market. However, in view of the present scenario due to Covid 19 pandemic, we grant three months’ time from today to the Developer to comply with this order failing which the amount shall carry interest @12% p.a.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Mr. Divyankar Pratap Singh and late Ms. Chandra Prabha Devi of Kasmanda Estates were the owners of some land in the city of Lucknow.  They entered into an agreement dated 29.12.1995 with M/s Consolidated Construction Company (hereinafter referred to as the builder) whereunder the builder was to construct a residential multi-storied complex on the afore-said land and the construction was to be shared between the owners and the builder in the ratio of 40% and 60% of the built-up area.
2.      The builder executed an agreement dated 31.07.2002 with Sh. Manoj Tahalani for sale of two residential flats in the above-referred complex to him for a consideration of Rs. 18,16,000/-.  As per the agreement flats No. 220 and 221 were to be sold to Mr. Manoj Tahalani and in case land owners wanted to retain these flats, flats No. 320 and 321 were to be made available to him.  It is an admitted position before me that flats No. 220 and 221 were not available for being provided to Mr. Manoj Tahalani and the builders later on agreed to provide flat No. 320 B in place of flat No. 321 which had been taken over by fire department.  As per the agreement dated 31.07.2002 payment of Rs. 4,50,000/- was made by Mr. Manoj Tahalani to the builders.  The builder also admitted a payment of Rs. 3,36,000/- made on 01.10.2002.  Some cash payments in addition to the above-referred payments are alleged by Mr. Manoj Tahalani to the builder, which have been disputed by the builder.  The allotment in favour of Mr. Manoj Tahalani, however, is alleged to have been cancelled  by the builder on 05.12.2003.  This is also the case of the builder that after cancelling the allotment made to Manoj Tahalani, they entered into an agreement with Mrs. Prabha Singh on 06.02.2004 and had later delivered possession of flat No. 320-B to her.
3.      A civil suit was instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani against the builder.  That suit was dismissed on the ground that the appropriate relief to be claimed would be for seeking specific performance of the agreement.  Mrs. Prabha Singh was not impleaded as  a party even to the civil suit and instead of filing a fresh civil suit for specific performance of the agreement Mr. Manoj Tahalani filed a consumer complaint without impleading Mrs. Prabha Singh as a party to the consumer complaint.  In the consumer complaint an application was filed by Mrs. Prabha Singh seeking impleadment on the ground that she was the allottee and was in possession of flat No. 320-B.  That application was dismissed by the District Forum which later on allowed the consumer complaint in favour of Mr. Manoj Tahalani in respect of both the flats i.e. flats No. 320 and 320-B.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, Mrs. Prabha Singh approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. The owners and builder also challenged the order passed by the District Forum.  Vide impugned order dated 25.02.2011 the State Commission set aside the order passed by the District Forum and directed possession of flat No. 320-B to be given to Mrs. Prabha Singh.  The possession of flat No. 320 was directed to be given to the complainant Mr. Manoj Tahalani, as was directed by the District Forum. Being aggrieved from the order so passed  by the State Commission the complainant Mr. Manoj Tahalani, the builder and the owner M/s Kasmanda Estates are before this Commission.
4.      Flat No. 401 in the above-referred project was agreed to be sold to Smt. Sheela Devi by way of agreement to sale dated 30.09.2002 and the same was registered on 07.10.2002.  As per the agreement to sale executed between the parties, a sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- had been paid by Smt. Sheela Devi by the time the agreement was executed.  Thereafter, an admitted payment of Rs. 6,50,000/- was made by her to the builder and she also claimed to have made some cash payments which the builder has disputed.  The allotment in favour of Smt. Sheela Devi was cancelled on 15.12.2003 on the ground that she had not made payment of the allotted flat.  Thereafter the above-referred flat No. 401 was allotted by the builder to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.  The possession of the flat, according to the builder, was delivered to Ramesh Chandra Mathur in December, 2004.  Of course, it was disputed by the complainant Smt. Sheela Devi.  A consumer complaint was then instituted by Smt. Sheela Devi before the concerned District Forum seeking possession of the allotted flat and for execution of the sale deed with possession.  Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur was not impleaded as party to the consumer complaint despite the fact that before instituting the consumer complaint Smt. Sheela Devi instituted a civil suit for injunction and even in that civil suit Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur was not impleaded as a party.  That civil suit was also dismissed by the civil court holding that the appropriate remedy would be to file a civil suit for specific performance. Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur filed an application seeking impleadment in the consumer complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi but the said application was dismissed by the District Forum.
5.      Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur also filed a consumer complaint in which Smt. Sheela Devi was not impleaded as a party.  The consumer complaint filed by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur is stated to be still pending. The pendency of the said consumer complaint is noted in the order of the State Commission.  The District Forum allowed the consumer complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi.  Feeling aggrieved Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur approached the State Commission by way of an appeal.  The builder also challenged the order passed by the District Forum. The State Commission allowed the appeals, set aside the orders of the District Forum and directed delivery of flat No. 401 to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur and also directed execution of the sale deed. Being aggrieved from the order of the State Commission Smt. Sheela Devi as well as land owner and the builder are before this Commission.
6.      It would thus be seen that one consumer complaint was instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani, one by Smt. Sheela Devi and one by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur. Sh. Manoj Tahalani did not implead Mrs. Prabha Singh who claims to be the subsequent allottee of the flat No. 320-B and the District Forum rejected her application for impleadment despite her claim that she was the subsequent allottee and was also in possession of flat No. 320- B. Similarly Smt. Sheela Devi also filed the consumer complaint without impleading Ramesh Chandra Mathur who claimed to be subsequent allottee of the flat No. 401 and who also claimed that the possession of the flat was with him.  The District Forum rejected his application for impleadment as well, despite his  averment and more importantly, despite the builder also taking the same stand that the above-referred flat No. 401 had been allotted by them to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.   The same stand was taken by the builder as regards the flat No. 320-B which they alleged to have allotted to Smt. Prabha Singh.
7.      In my opinion, the District forum was wholly unjustified in rejecting the applications filed by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur and Mrs. Prabha Singh seeking impleadment in the consumer complaints.  The veracity of the averments made by them ought to have been tested by impleading them as parties and giving them an opportunity to prove those averments.  It is not as if they had sought impleadment without any basis at all.  The stand taken by them has also been confirmed by the builder.  A common stand was taken by the builder as regards the alleged allotment to Mrs. Prabha Singh and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.  The District Forum ought to have impleaded both of them as parties to the consumer complaint. Mrs. Prabha Singh should have been impleaded in the complaint filed by Mr. Manoj Tahalani whereas Mr. Ramesh Chander Mathur should have been impleaded in the complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi.   In fact, all the counsel appearing before me are in agreement that the consumer complaint should be remitted back to the District Forum for being decided afresh after impleading Mrs. Prabha Singh in the consumer complaint instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur in the consumer complaint instituted by Mrs. Sheela Devi.  Similarly, if the consumer complaint instituted by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur is pending, Mrs. Sheela Devi ought to be impleaded as a party too in that consumer complaint.
8.      In the facts and circumstances of these cases the impleadment of the alleged subsequent allottes/purchasers was essential, they being necessary party to the consumer complaint.  The State Commission, in my opinion, was not justified in setting aside the order passed by the District Forum and directing delivery of possession to Mrs. Prabha Singh and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur along with execution of the sale deeds without impleading them as parties to the consumer complaints and without  testing veracity of their respective averments through the process of the District Forum, after giving opportunity to the contesting parties to lead their respective evidence. The contentious issues involved in these matters could not have been decided by the State Commission without impleading them as party to the consumer complaint and without having benefit of the evidence which the parties could produce in support of their respective case.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Arun Kumar Das, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Maheshlal Sharma, Advocate 
","1.       Present revision petition has been filed against the order of the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (in short, “the State Commission) dated 11.04.2013 in First Appeal No.415/2011 whereby the Appeal of the Petitioner was dismissed.
2.       Brief facts of the case are that the Respondents/Complainants entered into an agreement on 21.07.2007 to purchase a flat from the Petitioner for Rs.3,80,250/-. According to the Complainants they paid a total sum of Rs.4,27,000/-. As per the agreement the Petitioner was bound to deliver the flat within 12 months from the date of agreement. The Complainant after payment of Rs.4,27,000/- sought delivery of the flat and execution of the sale deed. A notice was issued by the Respondents for refund of Rs.4,27,000/- with interest. Alleging deficiency in service and negligence on the part of the Petitioner the Complainants filed a case in the District Forum.
3.       The Complaint was contested by the Petitioner. The Petitioner contended that on several occasions the Complainants were asked to make payment of the balance consideration so that the conveyance deed could be executed and registered. Instead of paying the same, the Complainants sent notice to the Petitioner seeking refund of the money. The Petitioner denied negligence or deficiency on their part and prayed for dismissal of the complaint.
4.       The District Forum observed that the Complainants had paid Rs.4,27,000/- against the consideration of Rs.3,80,250/- towards the cost of the flat, but the flat was not registered in the name of the Complainants. Disposal of the flat to a third party was a cause of mental agony and harassment to the Complainants. Accordingly, the Petitioner was directed to refund Rs.4,27,000/- with interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of filing of the case till its realization, among other reliefs. The order reads as follows: -
“That the case be and is allowed on contest with cost.
The O.P.-1 is directed to refund the entire amount of consideration for Rs.4,27,000/- alongwith interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of filing of this case i.e. 08.03.2010 till the date of realization within a period of 30 days from the date of this order.
The O.P.-1 is further directed to pay Rs.10,000/- towards compensation for causing harassment and mental agony to the complainant within a period of 30 days from this date.
There shall be an order of cost of Rs.1,000/- is to be paid by the O.P.-1 to the complainant within 30 days from this date.
In the event of non compliance of any portion of the order within the stipulated period the complainant is at liberty to execute the same as per provisions of law.
Let copies of the order be supplied to the parties free of cost when applied for.”
","5.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Petitioner filed an Appeal before the State Commission. The Petitioner contended before the State Commission that they were ready to deliver a flat on the 2nd floor of the premises but the Respondents refused to take possession. The Petitioner further contended that the agreement for sale of the flat was for consideration of Rs.3,80,250/-; possession of the flat could not be delivered due to default in payment by the Respondents despite several reminders. The Complainants were unwilling to take possession of the flat and delayed in payment of the consideration for the flat as a result of which the flat had been transferred to another party. The State Commission concurred with the finding of the District Forum that there was deficiency in service on the part of the Petitioner. The Petitioner failed to hand over possession of the flat in question as per the terms of the agreement and the Petitioner had already sold the flat in question to a third party. The State Commission observed that refund of sum of Rs.4,70,000/- with interest to the Complainant was only relief that could be allowed in the existing circumstances and found no reason to interfere with the order of the District Forum and dismissed the Appeal.
6.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the Petitioner filed the present Revision Petition.
7.       Heard the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner as well as the Respondents and also carefully perused the record. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner only contested the total sum of money paid by the Respondents. Both the Fora have taken the figure of Rs.4,27,000/- and awarded refund of the same alongwith interest, whereas according to the Petitioner the amount received was only Rs.3,37,000/-. The District Forum while giving reasons has recorded that “admittedly, there was an agreement for sale of a flat on the 1st floor between parties at a consideration of Rs.3,80,250/-. But it is not known how the complainants paid Rs.4,27,000/- against the consideration of Rs.3,80,250/-. The parties did not make any whisper for such deviation in making payment of consideration money for the flat.” The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner stated that only a sum of Rs.3,37,000/- was paid by the Respondents. Learned Counsel for the Respondents/Complainants could not produce any evidence by way of any document/receipt issued by the Petitioner towards payment of Rs.4,27,000/- nor any admission made by the Petitioner of having received the same. In view of lack of any evidence/document showing that the Respondents had paid Rs.4,27,000/- to the Petitioner and the agreement between the parties being for only Rs.3,80,250/-, the contention of the Respondents/Complainants is not acceptable. Obviously and logically the Respondents could not have paid more amount than the consideration amount given in the agreement.
8.       In view of the above, the concurrent findings of both the Fora are confirmed with the modification that the amount of refund be limited to the consideration amount of Rs.3,80,250/-.
8.       With the above modification, the Revision Petition stands disposed of.

","ORDER
1.     Heard learned counsel for the revisionist finance co. and the respondent complainant, and perused the material on record.
2.     The dispute relates to the finance co. wrongly obtaining Rs. 77,454/- from the complainant, first Rs. 32,454/- by threatening to forcibly re-possess his vehicle and then Rs. 45,000/- by forcibly re-possessing his vehicle and releasing it only after he paid the said Rs. 45,000/-.
3.     The District Forum vide its Order dated 29.12.2007 appraised the evidence and partly allowed the complaint, determining that the said Rs.32,454/- + Rs. 45,000/- = Rs. 77,454/- were wrongly obtained under threat of / by forcible re-possession of the subject vehicle.
The District Forum directed the finance co. to refund the said amount of Rs. 77,454/- to the complainant with interest at the rate of 9% per annum form the date of filing of the complaint i.e. 09.05.2007 along with Rs. 10,000/- as compensation and Rs. 1,000/- as cost of litigation.
4.     In appeal the State Commission again appraised the evidence and vide its Order dated 28.03.2014 dismissed the appeal, holding that “In view of the aforesaid facts and observations we are very much convinced that opponent finance company has recovered excess amount of Rs. 77,454/- as claimed by complainant and which is rightly directed by District Consumer Forum to refund the same with interest by way of its impugned judgment and order. Appeal is being devoid of any merits requires to be dismissed.”.
5.     This revision petition has been filed under section 21(b) of the Act 1986 against the said Order dated 28.03.2014 of the State Commission.
6.     Both the fora below have arrived at concurrent findings.
It is well evinced that the finance co., under threat of / by forcible re-possession of the subject vehicle wrongly obtained Rs. 32,454/- and Rs. 45,000/- (i.e. total Rs. 77,454/-) from the complainant, after the complainant had repaid the loan with interest as admissible.
7.     The impugned Order dated 28.03.2014 of the State Commission is well-appraised and well-reasoned. The State Commission has concurred with the District Forum. No crucial or palpable misappreciation of evidence is visible, as may cause to require de novo re-appreciation of the evidence in revision. On the face of it, no jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under section 21(b).
8.     The award made by the District Forum, and as upheld and affirmed by the State Commission, appears just and equitable.
9.     The Act 1986 is for “better protection of the interests of consumers”, its Statement of Objects and Reasons says of “speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes”.
10.   The complaint case was filed before the District Forum in 2007, the District Forum decided the case in 2007, the finance co. appealed before the State Commission in 2008, the State Commission decided the appeal in 2014, the finance co. filed the instant revision petition before this Commission in 2014, we are now in 2020.
11.   This is a case of a finance co., with wherewithal, on the one side, and an ordinary common ‘consumer’, without wherewithal, on the other side. As is well-evinced, the finance co. highhandedly and arbitrarily obtained Rs. 77,454/- from the complainant under threat of / by forcible re-possession, after the complainant had duly repaid his loan with interest as due. After concurrent findings on facts being returned by the two fora below, the finance co. agitated before the third forum, i.e. this Commission, for a (protracted) period of about 6 years, where, too, its case fails miserably.
12.   All this is not viewed favourably.
","13.   The revision petition, being patently misconceived and totally bereft of merit, is dismissed, with stern advice of caution to the finance co. through its chief executive by imposition of cost of Rs.25,000/- to be deposited by the finance co. in the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the District Forum within four weeks from today.
14.   The State Commission’s impugned Order is confirmed. The award made by the District Forum, and as upheld and affirmed by the State Commission, is sustained. The finance co. through its chief executive shall ensure compliance without further delay.
15.   The finance co. through its chief executive shall also pay Rs. 25,000/- to the complainant as cost of litigation in the revisional proceedings before this Commission within four weeks from today.
16.   The amount deposited by the finance co. with the District Forum in compliance of this Commission’s Order 24.06.2015 along with interest if any accrued thereon shall be utilized by the District Forum, as per the due procedure, towards satisfaction of its award and of the cost imposed herein (refer paras 13, 14 and 15 above).
17.   Needless to add, in case of failure or omission in compliance, the District Forum shall undertake execution, for ‘enforcement’ under section 25(3) and for ‘penalties’  under section 27 of the Act 1986, as per the law.
18.   The Registry is directed to send a copy of this Order to the chief executive of the finance co. within three days from today.
‘Dasti’, in addition.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
These petitions are directed against the order of the State Commission dated 10.12.2012 whereby the appeals filed by the petitioner society against the orders of the District Forum were dismissed as barred by limitation. There was a delay of 246 days in filing the appeals, which the State Commission declined to condone.
2.      The learned counsel appearing for the parties request for another adjournment on the ground that the parties may possibly settle their disputes. However, considering the age of the revision petitions which were filed in the year 2013 and also the fact that the State Commission did not decide the appeals on merits, I am not inclined to accept the request for adjournment.
3.      On a perusal of the impugned order I find that two grounds were basically taken by the petitioner society while seeking condonation of delay in filing the appeals. The first ground was that the President of the society having expired on 04.10.2009 the society could not hold a meeting to pass a resolution for approving the filing of appeal against the order of the District Forum. The society gave charge of the post of President to another person in May 2010 and thereafter a resolution was passed by the society giving approval to file appeal before the State Commission. The papers were accordingly handed over to an advocate namely Mr. Bangadka for filing appeal on behalf of the society. Being ill, suffering from asthama etc. the counsel could not promptly file the said appeal. This is also the case of the petitioner that the advocate engaged by them namely Mr. Bangadka had been advised rest for one month from 24.08.2010 to  24.09.2010.
4.      In my opinion considering the grounds given by the society and the extent of the delays which cannot be said to be inordinate, the State Commission ought to have condoned the delay subject to appropriate costs. It is not in dispute the president of the society had expired on 04.10.2009. Since he was handling the affairs of the society the meeting of the managing committee/ executive committee could not be convened to take an appropriate decision in respect of the orders passed by the District Forum. As soon as the charge of the post of the President was given to another person a meeting was duly convened and resolution was passed for filing appeals before the State Commission.
5.      The society having engaged an advocate to file appeals before the State Commission, it cannot be penalized for the circumstances on account of which the advocate could not file the appeals or even for the negligence on his part so long as the negligence was not very gross. A medical certificate of the advocate was filed to show that he was advised rest for one month. Obviously, he would take some time to start drafting new matters and appearing in courts. In these circumstances, the delay of about 8 months in filing the appeals cannot be said to be so gross and inordinate that the complainant cannot be compensated by way of costs.
","6.  For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned orders are set aside and the delay in filing appeals before the State Commission is condoned subject to payment of Rs. 50,000/- as cost in each matter. The costs shall be paid to the complainant within four weeks from today. The parties shall appear before the concerned State Commission on 02.09.2020. Subject to payment of costs the State Commission shall proceed with the appeals on merits from the stage at which they were dismissed. The appeals stand disposed of.

For the Petitioner                 : Mr. Sarthak Choudhary, Advocate
Pronounced on: 9th July 2020
ORDER
Brief facts, are that the petitioner entered into agreement with the OP- developer (hereinafter referred as ‘OP’) for development of the property by agreement dated 19.08.2011 and gave general power of attorney. As per the agreement the owner was to get Rs. 12,00,000/- but they actually received Rs. 10,00,000/- out of Rs. 12,00,000/- from the developer. But the developer failed to deliver the flat even after 24 months of the execution of the agreement as well as the balance payable of Rs. 2 Lakh as agreed in the agreement. Being aggrieved, the complainants filed a complaint before the District Forum against the OP regarding its liability to complete the construction, mutation of the building and to recover the balance amount as per the agreement, compensation etc.
The OP filed a written version and submitted that Nemai Chand Ghosh, (since deceased) had obtained a sanctioned plan on 19.03.2012 of G+2 storied building from HMC (Howrah Municipal Corporation). The OP has admitted that as per Agreement, he was under obligation to provide a self – contained flat of 600 sq. ft. and a sum of Rs. 12,00,000/- in easy instalment. The OP has further stated that he has delivered possession of the flat on the top floor to the complainants and also delivered possession to the tenants of the said Nemai Chand Ghosh. However, the OP has categorically stated that after the death of Nemai Chand Ghosh, the complainants being legal heirs refused to execute any Power of Attorney in favour of the OP, therefore there was delay in construction.
After assessing the materials on record, the Ld. District Forum allowed the complainant :
Ordered
That the CC No. 444/2014 be and the same is allowed on contest against the O.P. with cost.
The petitioners are entitled to get relief as prayed for and O.P. is directed to pay the remaining part of the amount ie. Rs. 2,00,000/- and to pay 1,00,000/- out of which the petitioners to get Rs. 50,000/- compensation and rest Rs. 50,000/- be deposited in the Consumer Legal Aid A/c and cost of Rs. 10,000/- . O.P. is also directed to complete the construction work within one month from the date of order as per agreement.
The O.P.s failing to do so the petitioner would be at liberty the put the order in execution and the whole awarded amount to carry interest @ 9 % p.a. till realization.
The O.P. appealed in the State Commission. The State Commission heard both sides, appraised the evidence and through its order affirmed the order of the District Forum with following observation:
It may be pertinent to record that one sanctioned plan being BR 90/84 for the year 2011 – 12 dated 13.08.2011 was obtained. Subsequently, the developer submitted a new plan being No. BMR No. 61/ B4/ 12-13.
The evidence on record clearly suggests that in accordance with the terms of agreement, the appellant / developer has already handed over one flat of 600 sq. ft. on the top floor to the respondents. However, out of Rs. 12,00,000/- to be paid by the appellant , there is document to show that he has paid Rs. 10,00,000/- to the landowners and the amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- is still due and payable by the developer.
The whole dispute cropped up on account of death of original Nemai Chand Ghosh on 28.11.2013. The construction has been completed in respect of a G+ 2 storied building. The appellant/ developer is constantly pressuring the legal heirs of the said Nemai Chand Ghosh i.e the respondents to execute a registered Power of Attorney in favour of him. In that perspective, it would be pertinent to have a look to the contents of registered Power of Attorney. The said Power of Attorney indicates that the commitment made by the deceased landowner is biding upon all his legal heirs i.e. the respondents / complainants of the case. Nemai Chand Ghosh died leaving him his wife (respondent no. 1), one daughter (respondent no. 2) and one son (respondent no. 3). As respondent no. 2 has been living abroad, she has executed a registered Power of Attorney in favour of her mother i.e. respondent no. 1. Therefore, I do not find any obstacle or hindrances on the part of the appellant/ developer to construct the building in accordance with the terms of agreement and to sale the allocation of developer’s portion and in this regard no Power of Attorney from the heirs of Nemai Chand Ghosh would be required.
Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the O.P has approached this Commission.
Heard the arguments at the admission stage and perused the material on record.
It is pertinent to note that as per the agreement the developer (OP-Petitioner) has not paid Rs. 12 lakh completely  and also there is no document to prove that he handed over possession of flat as agreed. Thus it was deficiency in service on the part of the O.P. The OP did not complete the construction of staircase and handover the mutation certificate of all the flats.
I find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned. The State Commission concurred with the findings of the District Forum. Within the meaning and scope of section 21(b), I find no grave error in appreciating the evidence by the two fora below, as may cause to require rejust and appropriate. And, on the face of it, I find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice.
","The revision petition, being misconceived and devoid of merit, is dismissed in limine.
Registry shall send the copy of this order to the parties and the District Forum by email and as well by speed post within 7 days from today.
Needless to add that the District Forum shall undertake execution as per the law.

From the contents of Section 22(2), it is clear that review is limited only to the error apparent on the face of record.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/appellant is a partnership firm engaged in the business of development and construction. The Case of the complainant/appellant as set out in paragraph 3 of the consumer complaint is that they were in search for a luxurious car for the use of its partners and based upon the representations made to them by the dealer they purchased a new Mercedes Benz car for a consideration of more than Rs 55 lacs. Alleging manufacturing defect in the car purchased by them they filed a consumer complaint against the respondent Mercedes Benz India Private Limited.
2.      The state Commission wide order dated 16.01.2014 dismissed the consumer complaint soley on the ground that the complainant was not a consumer. Being aggrieved the complainant/appellant is before this  Commission.
3.      The term ‘consumer’ as defined in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which to the extent it is relevant excludes from its ambit the person who purchases goods for resale or for any commercial purpose. Therefore, if the car was purchased for re-sale or for commercial purpose the complainant will not be consumer and, therefore a consumer complaint will not be maintainable.
4.      The question whether the purchaser of a car can be said to be a ‘consumer’ or not came for consideration of a Three-Member Bench of this Commission in CC No. 51/2006 Crompton
Greaves Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Daimler Chrysler India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. and the following view was taken:-
Noticing an apparent conflict in the decisions rendered by this Commission in Controls and Switchgear Company Ltd. Vs. Daimler Chrysler India Pvt. Ltd. and T and T Motors Ltd.

[First Appeal No. 723 of 2006] decided on 07.02.2013, both rendered by Benches comprising two Members, the following issue was referred to this larger Bench, for decision:-
Whether the purchase of a car or any other goods by a company for the use/personal use of its Director amounts to purchase for a commercial purpose, within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, or not.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the issue referred to the larger Bench is answered as follows:-
(a) If a car or any other goods are obtained or any services are hired or availed by a company for the use/personal use of its directors or employees, such a transaction does not amount to purchase of goods or hiring or availing of services for a commercial purpose, irrespective of whether the goods or services are used solely for the personal purposes of the directors or employees of the company or they are used primarily for the use of the directors or employees of the company and incidentally for the purposes of the company.
(b) The purchase of a car or any other goods or hiring or availing of services by a company for the purposes of the company amount to purchase for a commercial purpose, even if such a car or other goods or such services are incidentally used by the directors or employees of the company for their personal purposes.
5.      The broader issue was re-examined by another Three-Member Bench of this Commission recently in CC No. 349 of 2017 Springdale Core Consultants Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Pioneer Urbandland and Infrastructure Ltd.  and the following view was taken:-
8.     It would thus be seen that the legal status of the buyer be it a company, a partnership firm, a society, an Association of Persons or an individual is not relevant for deciding whether the buyer is a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act or not, the relevant factor being the purpose for which the residential plot / house is bought or booked by the buyer.  If a house / residential plot is booked or purchased by a company for the personal residential use of the employees of the company, the purchase / booking is not linked to the regular profit generating business activities of the company, and therefore it cannot be said that the residential plot/house is bought or booked by the company for a commercial purpose.  A company purchasing or booking a residential plot / house will be out of the purview of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act only if there is a close and direct nexus between the purchase / booking of the house / residential plot and the regular business activities of the said company.  The view taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in respect of the purchase of residential house by a Trust for its employees working in a Hospital being run by a Trust as a part of its commercial activities shall equally apply to the residential plot / house purchased / booked by a company for the residential use of its Directors, the determining factor being the purpose behind such purchase / booking and the legal status of the purchaser being immaterial.  Though, a company is not obliged by law to provide residential accommodation to its Directors, the same being the legal position with respect to its employees, it would be wholly immaterial whether the residential plot / house is intended to be used for the residence of the employees or of the Directors of the company.
The acquisition of a residential plot or house by a company, for being used as a residence of its directors or employees does not have a close and direct nexus with the regular business activities of the company, is not essential for the business activities of the company, does not aid, assist or promote its business and does not generate any business revenue or profit for the corporate. It is only a perquisite provided by the company to its Directors or employees, and may or may not form an integral part of their terms of employment or appointment, as the case may be.
9.     However if a residential plot / house is purchased / booked by a company as a part of its regular profit generating commercial activities and not for being used as the residence of its Directors / or employees such a purchase / booking would be for a commercial purpose and therefore, the company would not be a consumer, as far as such a purchase / booking is concerned.
10.   For the reasons stated hereinabove, and in view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust (supra), the reference is answered as follows:
1.     It is the purpose for which the residential plot / house is booked / purchased, which is material for determining whether the purchaser is a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The legal status of the purchaser, be it an individual, a partnership, an Association of Persons, a Trust, a Society or a Company is immaterial for such determination.
2.     If a house / residential plot is booked / purchased by a company for the residential use of its Directors / employees the company will be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, as far as such a booking / purchase is concerned.
3.    If a house / residential plot is bought / booked by a company as a part of its business activities and such purchase / booking has a close and direct nexus with the regular profit generating activities of the company, it will not be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act as far as such a purchase / booking is concerned.
The view taken by this Commission in Springdale Core (Supra) would equally apply to the purchase of a vehicle by a company or a partnership firm.
6.      In view of the above referred decisions what would be relevant is the purpose for which the car in question was purchased by the complainant/appellant.  The case of the complainant/appellant is that the car was purchased for the use of its partners. Of course, the said allegation needs to be established during trial of the complaint. But in view of the averment made in paragraph 3 of the consumer complaint the State Commission was not at all justified in dismissing the consumer complaint at the very threshold without even giving an opportunity to the complainant/appellant to prove the purpose for which the car was  purchased.
","7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove the impugned order is set aside and the consumer complaint is remitted back to the State Commission to proceed with the same from the same stage at which it was dismissed.  The parties are directed to appear before the State Commission on 01.09.2020. The respondent will be entitled to file its written version within 30 days from today taking all such pleas as are available to it in law.  A copy of this order be sent to the concerned State Commission within a week for information and compliance

","This appeal has been filed by M/s MAA Sarada Construction against order dated 05.11.2018 passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (‘the State Commission’) in Complaint case no. CC/607/2017.
2.     Learned proxy counsel for the main counsel for the appellant is present and states that they are not able to contact the appellant to get any instructions in the matter. On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent nos. 1 and 2 states that the amount of Rs.10,000/- as ordered by this Commission vide order dated 1st may 2019 has not been paid to respondent no.1. He further states that an amount of Rs.5.00 lakh was to be deposited vide the same order by the appellant and the same has not yet been deposited, therefore, he has already filed an execution, treating as if there is no stay.
3.     Learned counsel for the respondents no.1 and 2 further states that the State Commission gave an order to hand over the flat and register the sale deed of the flat within a period of sixty days failing which the amount paid will be refunded along with 12% per annum interest. He further states that the appeal has no merit and should be dismissed.
4.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents no.1 and 2, and have examined the material on record. Firstly, it is seen that there is a delay of 140 days in filing the present appeal. An application for condonation of delay of 125 days has been filed by the appellant. The reason for the delay has been due to the negligence on the part of the counsel. In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondent states that it is the easiest way to seek condonation of delay. However, no proof has been filed by the appellant.
5.     The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority IV (2011) CPJ 63 (SC), has observed that Special limitation periods are prescribed in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for speedy disposal of consumer disputes. The order reads as under:
It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this Court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the Consumer Foras”.
6.     In R B Ramlingam vs R B Bhavaneshwari, 2009 (2) Scale 108, it has been observed:
“We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
","7.     Both the above cases are fully applicable in the present matter, clearly, negligence, deliberate inaction are imputed to the appellant in the present matter. There is no justification for condonation of delay, accordingly, the application for condonation of delay is dismissed.
8.     Even going by merit also, it is seen that the State Commission has given both the options to the appellant, that the appellant can hand over the possession and get the sale deed executed within a period of sixty days or can refund the amount deposited by the respondent along with 12% per annum interest. From this consideration also, I do not find any merit in the present appeal.
9.     Based on the above discussion, the appeal no. 755 of 2019 is dismissed on account of limitation as well as on merit.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Yogesh Swaroop, Advocate  
				Mr. Kapil Kishore Kaushik, Advocate for R-1 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/ respondent No.1 had taken a standard fire and special peril policy from the appellant in order to take an insurance cover on the stock which he had hypothecated with the respondent Punjab National Bank.  The policy was valid from 17.03.2004 to 16.03.2005.  On 27.04.2004 a fire broken out in the premises of the complainant. An intimation of the fire was given to the banker as well to the concerned police station on the next day.  The insurer was informed of the fire on 05.05.2004.  A surveyor was appointed by the insurer to assess the loss to the complainant.  The surveyor assessed the loss at Rs.2,46,493/-. The said amount was offered by the insurer to the complainant but was declined by him.  The complainant thereafter approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint, seeking payment of Rs.22 lakh from the insurer along with interest, etc.
The banker was also impleaded as a party to the consumer complaint.
2.     The complaint was resisted by the insurer which sought to justify the assessment made by the surveyor and the amount offered by it to the complainant.
3.     Vide impugned order dated 29.01.2010 the State Commission directed the insurer to pay a sum of Rs.22 lakh to the complainant alongwith  interest @ 9% p.a. w.e.f. 27.05.2004, compensation quantified at Rs.25,000/- and cost of litigation quantified at Rs.20,000/-. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission the insurer is before this Commission.
4.     A perusal of the impugned order would show that the State Commission decided the consumer complaint solely on the basis of the evidence produced by the complainant noting in para 23 of the impugned order that neither of the opposite parties had filed any evidence though the insurer had relied upon the expert report annexed to its reply.
5.     The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently submits that the appellant had filed as many as three affidavits by way of evidence, the said affidavit having been sworn by (1) Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, (2) Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and (3) Mr. Harish Kumar, Surveyor who was appointed by the insurer. The learned counsel for the complainant however, submits that no such affidavit was filed before the State Commission. The appellant company has filed an affidavit of Mr. Ashish Verma, Advocate who had represented it before the State Commission. In his affidavit filed before this Commission Mr.Ashish Verma, Advocate has stated that he was representing the appellant company in the above referred consumer complaint and had filed the affidavits of evidence of Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and Mr. Harish Kumar, Surveyor in the Registry of the State Commission on 13.04.2007 vide diary No.1869.
6.     The record of the State Commission called by to verify as to whether the said affidavits were available on record or not.  It has however been reported that the record has been destroyed. As a result it is not possible to verify the affidavit solemn by Mr.  Ashish Verma, Advocate.
7.     The appellant has placed on record the photocopies of by the affidavits of Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and Mr. Harish Kumar, Surveyor. A perusal of the said photocopies would show that the affidavits were sworn before an Oath Commissioner on 02.04.2007.  This would show that the affidavits of all the three persons referred above were actually prepared and got attested. The insurer has also filed an affidavit of an officer of the company who has stated in the said affidavit that the insurer had filed affidavits of Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and Mr. Harish Kumar, Surveyor before the State Commission.
8.     In view of the affidavit of Mr. Ashish Verma, Advocate who has not only sworn on oath with respect to the filing of the affidavit by way of evidence but has also given a particular diary number, I see no reason to disbelieve the case set out by the appellant and consequently hold that the appellant had actually filed the affidavits of Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and Mr.Harish Kumar, Surveyor with the concerned State Commission but the said either the said affidavits were not placed on record and remained lying in the Registry of State Commission or the same were  available on record but had escaped the notice of the State Commission.  Though there is no documentary proof of the copies of the affidavits having been delivered to the complainant, there is a possibility of the affidavits having been filed without serving the copies upon the complainant.
9.     The impugned order having been passed without considering the affidavits filed by the appellant by way of evidence is wholly one sided and cannot be sustained.  The impugned order is therefore set-aside subject to payment of Rs.50,000/- as cost to the complainant within four weeks from today. The parties shall appear before the State Commission on 15.04.2020.  The copies of the affidavits of Mr. C.P. Parwani, Manager of the insurer, Mr. P.B. Chopra, Chartered Accountant and Mr.Harish Kumar, Surveyor shall be filed before the State Commission on that date along with an affidavit from an officer of the insurer.  The State Commission shall thereafter proceed to decide the complaint afresh, after considering the entire material available to it including the above referred three affidavits.
","10.    The amount with the appellant had deposited in compliance of the interim order of this Commission shall remain deposited and final order with respect to disbursal of the said amount shall be passed by the State Commission while deciding the complaint a fresh  in terms of this order. The First Appeal stands disposed of.

","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

","The present revision petition has been filed by Dr Abhishek Bansal and Anr., against the order dated 23.11.2016 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh in MA no. 2103 of 2016 in First Appeal no. 257 of 2016. The original complainants in the matter, i.e., respondent nos.1 and 2 are not appearing despite service of notice since 2017, hence they are proceeded ex parte. Other parties have been heard.
2.     Learned counsel for the petitioners states that the prayer in the appeal before the State Commission was for enhancement of compensation, however, the petitioners could not appear before the State Commission and the State Commission has passed an order against the petitioner no .1/ opposite party no.1 and petitioner no.2/ opposite party no.5 to pay compensation of Rs.5.00 lakh jointly by the petitioner, whereas the  District Forum has passed an order of award of Rs.1.00 lakh to be paid by the petitioner no.2/ opposite party no.5 only and the same was already paid by the insurance company on behalf of OP no.5/ petitioner no.2 to the complainant. It is alleged by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioner could not place any defence before the State Commission and the State Commission have passed order that they are liable to pay compensation. This is only a one sided order and therefore, the same should be set aside.
From the appeal, it seems that the appeal was filed to set aside the order of the District Forum and for enhancement of compensation. The presumption of the petitioners is not correct when they say that the appeal was only for enhancement of compensation from the OPs against whom the order of District Forum was passed. An appellate court has the jurisdiction of the trial court and the appellate forum can decide the matter differently in its totality and in the interest of justice.
3.     Learned counsel for respondent no.4 states that no liability was fastened by the District Forum or the State Commission on respondent no.4 and hence they may be deleted from the array of parties. Learned counsel for respondent no.3/ OP no.2 states that an amount of Rs.1.00 lakh was awarded against OP no.2/ respondent no.3 herein and the same has been complied with.
","4.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. We find that there is some merit in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the State Commission has not heard them as they could not appear before the State Commission. The State Commission has passed an order for Rs.5.00 lakh to be paid by the petitioners to the complainant, though in the order of the District Forum, the petitioner no.2 was required to pay Rs.1.00 lakh only. In the interest of justice, it seems necessary that the petitioners should be heard by the State Commission. It is seen that there is delay of 118 days in filing the present appeal. In this connection, the learned counsel for the petitioners has stated that the petitioners had filed an application setting aside the ex parte order before the State Commission but the same was dismissed, hence, the present revision petition could be filed with delay. The delay is condoned at a cost of Rs.20,000/- to be paid to the complainants/ respondent nos.1 and 2. As the petitioners have not got any opportunity to place their defence before the State Commission, we set aside the order dated 23.11.2016 and remand the matter to the State Commission for deciding the appeal filed by respondent nos.1 and 2 on merits after hearing the petitioners and other parties, subject to the petitioner paying a cost of Rs.1.00 lakh to respondent nos.1 and 2, the original complainants. Cost be paid on or before the next date of hearing. However, the State Commission, if they feel, shall enhance the time for such payment of cost as per the requirement, if any. The State Commission shall hear the petitioners and other parties only after the cost of Rs.20,000/- and Rs.1.00 lakh totalling to Rs.1,20,000/- has been paid to respondent nos.1 and 2/ original complainants.
5.     Parties to appear before the State Commission on 20th May 2020.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :in person 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Mange Ram against the order dated 14.10.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in FA No.358 of 2017.
2.      Heard the petitioner in person at the admission stage and perused the record.  The petitioner stated that the petitioner had booked a plot under an advertisement given by the respondent and at different intervals paid Rs.6,50,000/- to the respondent. The respondent had no land and therefore, no plot was given to the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner filed a consumer complaint bearing no.406 of 2015 before the District Forum and the District Forum allowed refund of the amount of Rs.6,50,000/- alongwith 10% p.a. interest from the date of filing of the complaint i.e. 29.06.2015 till actual payment.  Apart from this a compensation of Rs.50,000/- and litigation cost of Rs.10,000/- was also ordered.
3.      The petitioner/complainant preferred an appeal bearing No.358 of 2017 before the State Commission on various grounds inter alia the ground that the interest on the amount of Rs.6,50,000/- shall be paid from the date of respective deposits.  The State Commission vide its order dated 14.10.2019 disallowed the award of compensation and cost of litigation as awarded by the District Forum. The following portion of the State Commission’s order shows that the demand of the petitioner for giving interest on the amount of Rs.6,50,000/- from the date of respective deposits was considered by the respondent and the grievance of the petitioner/complainant in this regard was settled before the State Commission:-
“2.   In appeal the complainant wanted interest from the date of deposit instead of date of filing complaint.  On 31.05.18 the counsel for respondent brought a cheque for Rs.9,97,997/- towards refund of principal amount and interest @10% p.a. as allowed by the District Forum. According to complainant/appellant he should have got Rs.11 lakhs.  The respondent was directed to sort out the matter.
3.     On 20.09.19 the respondent filed calculation of interest from the date of payment made by complainant/appellant and submitted that now the grievance of the appellant regarding the period also stands satisfied.
4.      The petitioner/complainant has preferred this revision petition against the order of the State Commission with the following prayers:-
“A.   That the amount of Rs.6,50,000/- along with interest/compensation @18% PA may be allowed to be returned to petitioner from the dates of respective payments till the date of realization as there cannot be two rules, one for builder and the other for consumer.
B.    That a sum of Rs.7 lakh for mental agony/tension and Rs 2 lakh for litigation cost be awarded.
C.   Grant any other relief/concession which the Hon’ble National Commission deems fit and proper to meet the end of justice.”
5.      The petitioner submitted that the opposite party was charging interest @18% p.a. on the defaulted amounts and therefore, the petitioner/complainant is also entitled to get 18% p.a. interest on the amount of refund of Rs.6,50,000/-.  The petitioner further submitted that the State Commission has set aside the order of the District Forum awarding compensation of Rs.50,000/- and cost of litigation as Rs.10,000/-.  The reason given by the State Commission is that the interest is also in the form of compensation and therefore, separate compensation cannot be allowed.
6.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the petitioner.  As there is no agreement between the parties to award interest on the amount of refund, it is the discretion of the consumer forum to award interest on the amount of refund.  Looking at the facts and circumstances of the case, the District Forum has allowed interest @ 10% p.a. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in  New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Protection Manufacturers Private Limited, (2010) 7 SCC 386, has held that if there is no clause in the agreement for paying interest, the consumer forum has to apply its discretion for awarding the interest.  The order reads as under:-
“We also accept the discretion exercised by the National Commission regarding the rate of interest awarded from three months after the date of the Award. The submissions made on behalf of the Respondent Company for enhancement of the same is rejected as we are of the view that such exercise of discretion was just and equitable in the absence of any agreement between the parties regarding payment of interest or the quantum thereof.”
7.      Recently the Hon’ble Supreme Court has also awarded 9% p.a. interest on the amount of refund in Kolkata West International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Deva Asis Rudra, II (2019) CPJ 29 (SC), by reducing interest of 12% p.a. granted by this Commission on the amount of refund to 9% p.a.  In the present case, the District Forum has allowed interest @10% p.a., which seems to be reasonable and appropriate keeping in view the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Deva Asis Rudra, (supra).
8.      Parity with builder cannot be established because the builder/developer is charging 18% p.a. interest on the defaulted amount as per the agreement entered between the parties whereas, the petitioner is demanding 18% p.a. interest for which there is no agreement and when there is no agreement, it is the discretion of the consumer forum to give interest keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case.  Thus, the argument of the petitioner regarding parity is not tenable.
9.      So far as the compensation and cost of litigation are concerned, the State Commission has taken the correct view that when the interest is being awarded on the amount of refund and as the interest is also in the form of compensation, therefore, separate compensation may not be allowed.  Sufficient interest has been awarded by the District Forum and therefore, I do not find justification for any separate compensation.   The State Commission has set aside the order of the District Forum in respect of the compensation as well as cost of litigation.  Clearly, the order of the State Commission is correct in respect of the compensation, whereas in respect of the cost of litigation, I am of the view that the cost of Rs.10,000/- as awarded by the District Forum was appropriate to be given to the complainant by the opposite party.
10.    Based on the above discussion, I partly allow the revision petition No.2548 of 2019 with the direction that the respondent/opposite party shall also pay cost of litigation as Rs.10,000/- to the petitioner/complainant alongwith 9% p.a. interest from the date of order of the District Forum till actual payment.  No notice is being issued to the respondent/opposite party before passing this order as this is a small amount and the respondent/opposite party will have to spend more to contest the revision petition.  I have also kept in mind the fact that the respondent/opposite party was satisfied with the order of the District Forum as it did not prefer any appeal against that order before the State Commission. However, if the respondent/opposite party feels aggrieved by this order, they may approach this Commission by filing a miscellaneous application in this revision petition.  The respondent/opposite party is directed to pay this amount of Rs.10,000/- along with interest apart from order passed by the State Commission to the petitioner/complainant within a period of 45 days, failing which the petitioner/complainant shall be entitled to move to the executing court for execution of this order.

","This consumer complaint has been filed by the complainant Rahul Om Arora against the opposite parties M/s. Orris Infrastructure Private Limited and anr.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the complainant was allotted vide allotment letter 28.08.2012 an apartment No.604, Tower No.14, in the opposite parties project ‘Greenopolis’, Sector 89, Gurgaon for a total consideration of Rs.1,07,92,880/-.  As per the ledger dated 22.03.2018, the complainant has paid a sum of Rs.77,57,892/- to Three C Shelters (OP2) towards the sale consideration and the last installment was paid on 08.07.2015. As per clause 5.1 of the Apartment Buyer Agreement executed on 24.5.2013, the opposite parties promised to handover the complete possession of the apartment within 36 months with a grace period of 6 months from the date of the allotment of the apartment i.e. by 27.02.2016. However, the possession has not been handed over to the complainant as the building itself is not complete. Accordingly, the complaint has been filed for a refund of the paid amount.  The main prayers made in the complaint are as under:-
(i) To direct OP to refund the entire amount paid by the complainant with 18% p.a. penal interest from the date of deposit.
(ii)    To direct OP to pay compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- & Rs. 5,00,000/- towards litigation costs.
3.      The complaint has been resisted by the opposite parties by filing the written statement.  It has been stated that the delay has happened on account of force majeure conditions which were beyond the control of the OPs. Both parties have filed their evidence by way of affidavits which have been taken on record.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the complainant stated that similar complaints have already been decided against the same opposite parties and therefore, these are covered cases under the judgments already passed by this Commission.  Learned counsel referred to the judgment of this Commission in Atma Krishna Vs. Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. &anr. CC No.1590 of 2016 decided on 21.12.2018 (NC) where this Commission has allowed the refund of the deposited amount along with 10% p.a. interest from the date of respective deposits.  Learned counsel for the complainants requested that this consumer complaint be also allowed on the same lines as of Atma Krishna Vs. Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. &anr. (supra).
5.      Learned counsel for the complainant further stated that all the objections raised by the opposite parties have already been discussed in detail and have been decided in the aforesaid consumer complaint.  Learned counsel for the complainant further stated that in the present consumer complaint, the payment has been made to the opposite party Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. and therefore, if the refund is ordered, they should be responsible for refund of the amount.  In this complaint, the possession was due by 27.02.2016, however, even the construction is not complete and therefore, there is no question of giving any possession by the opposite parties. The learned counsel mentioned that in this case, the possession has not been offered till date.  Hence, refund has been requested.  The learned counsel further stated that all the objections raised by the opposite parties have been discussed in detail and decided by this Commission in Atma Krishna Vs. Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. &anr. (supra), therefore, arguments are not repeated.
6.       Learned counsel for the complainant further stated that the plea taken by the OPs in respect of the force majeure conditions is not valid. First of all, the order of the Hon’ble High Court referred to by the OPs was only in respect of not drawing the ground water. The High Court order does not put  ban on the construction activity nor any ban on use of water. The OPs should have brought water from outside and should have used the same for construction activity. Thus, this order of the Hon’ble High Court cannot be treated as force majeure condition. Obviously, the OPs should have  taken remedial measures. Once the apartment buyer agreement is signed between the parties, the OPs have to keep in mind the adverse situations  that may arise and they should be ready to counter those conditions so that  complainants need not suffer for the same. In support of his argument, the learned counsel referred to the judgment in M/s. IREO FiveriverPVt. Ltd. vs. Surinder Kumar Singla and another, FA No.1358 of 2016, decided on 29.11.2016 by this Commission, wherein it has been observed:
“14.       We have considered the rival contentions and perused the record. On careful consideration of record, we do not find merit in the contention of the appellant.  In our considered view, the protection of Force Majeure clause in the agreement between the parties is not available to the appellant builder for the reason that it is the stand of the appellant that vide letter dated 16.03.2011, DTCP Haryana had directed the appellant not to carry out any earth work or construction work at the subject site without obtaining no objection certificate from the Irrigation Department Haryana.  It is also admitted case of the appellant that ultimate clearance for undertaking construction work was received vide letter dated 24.04.2015 of National Board of Wild Life granting clearance for the development project. Despite of the aforesaid restraint on the appellant for carrying out development work, admittedly, the appellant executed Plot Buyer’s agreement with the respective complainants during the period 23.06.2011 to 23.04.2012.  It is not the case of the appellant that while entering into the agreement, the appellant disclosed about the restraint letter dated 16.03.2011 issued by DTCP Haryana.  Thus, it is clear that appellant by concealment of material fact defrauded the respondents / complainants to execute the agreement contained Force Majeure clause, which in our considered opinion is unfair practice amounting to deficiency in service. As the agreement containing Force Majeure clause has been executed by concealment of material fact on the part of the opposite party, the aforesaid agreement is not binding on the complainants.  Thus, appellant cannot take benefit of said clause.  In view of the discussion above we do not find fault with finding of State Commission holding the appellant to be guilty of deficiency in service and directed the appellant to refund the money paid by the respective complainants with 12% interest besides payment of compensation and litigation expenses.”
7.       On the other hand, learned counsel for Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. stated that Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. is only the land owner and the Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. is the developer. There is a development agreement between these two parties and this was in the knowledge of complainants. As per this development agreement, 35% units are to be sold by Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and 65% units are to be sold by Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd.  In this background, it is to be considered that the project has been delayed by Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. and therefore, Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. is not responsible for paying any compensation for the delay in handing over the possession.
8.       The learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 stated that the arguments of the opposite parties are same as were advanced in Atma Krishna Vs. Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. &anr. (supra), however, the learned counsel emphasized on the following points:-
(i)      It is accepted that there has been a delay in the project, however, the matter has now been taken cognizance of by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, Haryana (RERA,Haryana). The RERA Haryana had convened a meeting on 7.9.2018 where MDs of Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. participated and it has been decided that the construction will be completed by 30.9.2020. The property in question is likely to be ready by that time and opposite parties will be in a position by that time to give possession.
(ii)      Coming to the force majeure conditions, it was stated that vide order dated 31.7.2012, Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana  in “Sunil Singh Vs. Ministry of Environment & Forests parayavaran” which was numbered as CWP-20032-2008  imposed a blanket ban on the use of ground water in the region of Gurgaon and adjoining areas for the purposes of construction.  In the light of force majeure conditions, no compensation is payable according to clause 5.2 of the apartment buyer agreement. The delay has occurred  due to conditions prevailing which were beyond the control of the OPs.
(iii)     A consumer forum is authorized to order compensation as per Section 14(i)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the compensation  has to be based on the loss or injury suffered by complainant due to negligence of the OPs.  In the present case, no loss has been suffered by the complainants as no proof has been  filed by the complainants whether they have suffered any loss due to payment of any rent or any such other thing.
9.         I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record.
10.    Clearly the OPs have not been able to complete the project in time and to deliver the possession of property in question to the complainant in time as per the allotment letter or the Apartment Buyer Agreement. It is now clearly established that the allottee has right to ask refund if the possession is inordinately delayed and particularly beyond one year. In the present case, the project is not yet complete though the possession was to be given in the year, 2016.  The OPs have taken the defence of force majeure conditions for delay including the order of the  Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana  in “Sunil Singh Vs. Ministry of Environment & Forests Parayavaran (supra)  wherein the use of ground water was restricted and OPs had to bring water from outside. Clearly, there was no ban on construction and OPs should have put their resources and managerial skills to bring water from outside and to complete the construction in time. On the one hand, learned counsel for Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. has pleaded force majeure conditions for delay and on the other hand, Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. has pleaded that Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. is responsible for delay in construction. Clearly it was a joint project of Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd.  as both of them have signed the Apartment Buyer Agreement, therefore, both are responsible for delay. However, in case where refund has been sought, the opposite party that has taken the money from the allottee, will be liable to refund if ordered.
11.     As Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. has received all the amount paid by the complainant, Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. would be liable to refund the same to the complainant.  Recently, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Deva Asis Rudra, II (2019) CPJ 29 (SC) has reduced the interest from 12% p.a. awarded by this Commission on the amount of refund to 9% p.a.  Hence, it will be appropriate to order refund of amounts along with 9% p.a. interest from the date of respective deposits.
12.     So far as the question of forfeiture of earnest money is concerned, it is seen that the complainant is seeking refund as the project has been inordinately delayed. Even though the RERA, Haryana has taken a meeting to expedite the project and Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. has agreed to complete the project in phases, it is seen in the same proceedings that the following has also been observed:
“7.    The license holder and developer have entered into an agreement without permission of the government/DTCP Haryana which may attract action against the license holder as well as against the developer which finally in turn will affect the interest of the allottees. BIP permission is necessarily and legally required to regularize the already entered agreement by the developer and license holder. License holder shall apply for BIP in favour of 3C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. with DTCP Haryana, preferably within a month. The fee for BIP shall be paid to the government for which the drafts shall be made by the developer 3C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. preferably within a month and thereafter within three days of getting the draft the licensee shall apply for the BIP and pursue with the Government for issuance of the same well in time.”
13.     From the above, it is clear that Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. have not entered into the agreement as per provisions of law and accordingly, the Development Agreement itself becomes questionable and without any basis. Though this ground has not been taken by the complainant for seeking refund, however this is also a valid ground for the complainant for seeking refund. If there is uncertainty in the development agreement itself as entered between Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd., no allottee would like to block his capital with these opposite parties.
14.     This Commission has recently decided similar cases against the same OPs where the money was paid by the allottees to Three C Shelter Pvt. Ltd.  These cases have been decided as bunch matters in CC 2781 of 2017, Nitin Gupta  Vs. Three C Shelters Pvt. Ltd. decided on 20.7.2020 and the amounts paid by the allottees have been refunded alongwith interest @9% per annum from the date of respective deposits till realisation.
","15.    Based on the above discussion, the complaint is allowed and following order is passed:-
ORDER
Opposite party Three C. Shelters Pvt. Ltd. shall refund the amount of Rs.77,57,892/- along with interest @ 9% p.a. from the date of respective deposits till actual payment to the complainant.  This order be complied with within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.  Opposite party Three C. Shelters Pvt. Ltd. shall also pay Rs.10,000/- to the complainant as cost of litigation.

Pronounced on:  23rd  January  2020
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.     The present Revision Petition is against the impugned order dated 14.10.2011 of the Andhra Pradesh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Hyderabad (hereinafter “State Commission”) in FA 699 of 2009, where the appeal was allowed and the order of the District Forum in CC. No. 9 of 2009 was set-aside.
2.     Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the case are that the complainants’ son had taken a policy from the OP for his vehicle on 27.03.2008. The period of insurance was 27.03.2008 to 26.3.2009. The insured had also paid premium to cover personal accident risk of owner- driver to the tune of Rs. 1 Lakh. On 6.04.2008 , the insured met with an accident which resulted in his death . The OP did not pay the claim amount to the nominees (complainants). Hence, a complaint was filed before the District Consumer Forum, Mahabubnagar (hereinafter referred as ‘District Forum’).
3.     The complaint was resisted by the OP. It was contended that neither the information about the accident was given nor any claim form was furnished. Moreover, the complainants were not entitled to the claim as the insured did not possess a license at the time of the accident. This was mandatory as per the terms of the policy.
4.     The District Forum, after considering the averments of the parties, dismissed the complaint vide order dated 29.05.2009 by stating that the owner of the insured vehicle as well as the complainants had breached the terms and conditions of the policy. It observed as below:
9. ….The complainants did not file any evidence even before us to show that firstly they informed about the accident and later they submitted Claim Form along with necessary and required documents to enable the OP to decide the claim. Without following law and complying the conditions of the policy and procedure, the complainants cannot blame the OP for not settling the claim. Mere issuing legal notice without any prior intimation of accident as well as claim submission will not serve the purpose. In these circumstances, we are fully agreeing with the contentions of the OP that first of all the owner cum driver of the insured motor cycle was not holding driving license as on the date of accident and secondly the complainants have not informed about the accident and submitted any claim to the OP as such they breached the terms and conditions of the policy and they have filed the complaint without approaching the OP. In these circumstances, we are relying upon the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Sandari and Others Vs. Susheel Kumar and Others reported in CPJ 2008 (2) P.21 (SC) and also upon the decision of the Hon’ble APSCDRC in the case of R.R. Industrial Products and another Vs. National Insurance Co. Limited reported in 2008 (3) CPJ, P. 158, wherein it is held that Insurer can avoid its liability on the ground of violation of conditions of the contract of insurance. In view of the above case law, facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the considered opinion that the owner of insured vehicle and also complainants breached the terms and conditions of the policy and as such the OP Company is not liable to pay the amount under the policy. The complainants also failed to establish the deficiency of service on the part of OP and as such they are not entitled for any of the reliefs so prayed. Hence the complaint is liable to be dismissed.
10. In the result, the complaint is dismissed but in the circumstances of the case no order as to costs.
(paras 9 and 10 of the District Forum’s Order)
5.     Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the complainants preferred an appeal to the State Commission.
6.     The State Commission allowed the appeal and set- aside the order of the District Forum. It directed the OP to pay Rs. 1 Lakh with interest @ 9% p.a from the date of filing of the complaint i.e 16.12.2008 till the date of realization. Compensation of Rs. 10,000 for mental agony and Rs. 5,000 as costs was also awarded.
7.     Aggrieved by the abovesaid order of the State Commission, the OP has preferred the present Revision Petition.
8.     We have heard the ld. counsel for the petitioner. Despite service of notice, the respondents – complainants were not present. So, vide order dated 20.03.2017, they were proceeded ex- parte.
9.     On perusal of Certificate Cum Policy Schedule, it is seen that there is a clause which specifies about the driver. The same is reproduced below:
DRIVER : Any person including the insured Provided that a person driving holds an effective driving license at the time of the accident and is not disqualified from holding or obtaining such a license. Provided also that the person holding an effective Learner’s license may also drive the vehicle and that such a person satisfies the requirements of Rule 3 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1939.
10.   Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 necessitates a person driving a motor vehicle to possess an effective driving license. The section reads as:
(1) No person shall drive a motor vehicle in any public place unless he holds an effective driving licence issued to him authorising him to drive the vehicle; and no person shall so drive a transport vehicle [other than 1[a motor cab or motor cycle] hired for his own use or rented under any scheme made under sub-section (2) of section 75] unless his driving licence specifically entitles him so to do.—(1) No person shall drive a motor vehicle in any public place unless he holds an effective driving licence issued to him authorising him to drive the vehicle; and no person shall so drive a transport vehicle [other than 1[a motor cab or motor cycle] hired for his own use or rented under any scheme made under sub-section (2) of section 75] unless his driving licence specifically entitles him so to do.
11.   We would like to rely on the order passed in Liberty General Insurance Ltd. v. Pranali Popat Suryavanshi, as reported in II (2019) CPJ 333 (NC), wherein the following was held:
10. …I hold that in the event of death of the insured himself, in an accident at the time he is driving a vehicle without holding a valid and effective Driving License, no benefit under such a policy would be available. Had the accident resulted in death of someone other than the insured himself, or had he himself not been driving the vehicle, the position would have been entirely different. But, where the insured himself is driving a vehicle without possessing a valid Driving License and the vehicle meets with an accident resulting in his death, no benefit under such a policy would be available.
12.   Prima facie, we note that the case is of violation of terms and conditions of the policy.  The insured was not in possession of an effective driving license at the time of the accident. The complainants too, have failed to annex any driving license of their son i.e the insured.  Even if it is taken that the driving license was damaged at the time of the accident, the complainants should have got the particulars by approaching the concerned Transport Authority. But, they failed to do so.  This in itself shows that they have not approached the consumer fora with clean hands.  No liability can be fastened on the OP for deficiency in service.
","13.   On the basis of the foregoing discussion, the instant Revision Petition is allowed.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
14.   The District Forum vide its Order dated 29.05.2009 had dismissed the complaint. In appeal, the State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 14.10.2011, had set aside the Order of the District Forum and allowed the complaint.
15.   The short point in this case is that, ex facie, the insured did not possess a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. A valid driving licence, or, if the same had in any way been damaged or misplaced, the salient particulars thereof (to show that the insured did in fact possess a valid driving licence at the time of the accident), were not adduced in evidence before the forum of original jurisdiction i.e. the District Forum. Not having a valid driving licence was a breach of an explicit condition of the insurance policy. It was also a violation of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.  As such, no ‘deficiency in service’ is made out against the petitioner insurance company.
16.   The State Commission has erred in appreciating the facts and evidence and has given erroneous findings.
17.   Based on the afore discussion, the revision petition is allowed, the Order dated 14.10.2011 of the State Commission is set aside, the Order dated 29.05.2009 of the District Forum sustains, the complaint stands dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents had filed consumer complaints against the appellants which were allowed by the State Commission with a direction to the appellant to refund the amount received by them from the complainant along-with interest and compensation in terms of the said order.
2.      The order passed by the State Commission in the consumer complaint having not been complied the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of execution applications. In the execution proceedings the State Commission initially attached the bank account of the appellants.  The parties thereafter filed compromise applications before the State Commission containing the terms of the settlement arrived at between them and post-dated cheques in terms of the said settlement were given by the appellants to the complainants.  The said cheques, when presented, were dishonoured.  The State Commission while disposing of the execution applications as withdrawn/satisfied, had granted liberty to the complainants to get the said execution applications revived if any of the cheques was dishonoured.  It was also directed that if any of the cheques was dishonoured the appellant would be liable to pay Rs. 50,000/- for each bounced cheque and the said amount would be deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission. It is the afore-said direction of the State Commission for payment of penalty @ Rs. 50,000/- for each dishonoured cheque which is under challenge in these appeals.
3.      The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that neither Section 25 nor Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, gives jurisdiction to the consumer fora to impose penalty of this nature. I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the appellant in this regard. In terms of Section 25(3) of the Consumer Protection Act, the State Commission can issue a recovery certificate to the concerned collector requiring him to recover the amount payable by the appellants to the complainants as arrears of land revenue. In terms of Section 27(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, the State Commission, in case of failure or omission of the appellants to comply with its order, can punish them to imprisonment which would not be less than one month but can exceed upto three years and/or can also impose fine which shall not been less than Rs. 2,000/- but can extend uoto Rs. 10,000/-. Therefore, the order of the State Commission to the extent penalty of Rs. 50,000/- on the  dishonour of each cheque was imposed upon the appellants cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside.
4.      It is, however, made clear that the complainants shall be entitled to seek enforcement of the order of the State Commission by issuance of a recovery certificate in terms of Section 25(3) of the Consumer Protection Act, if the said order has not been fully complied with.  The complainants shall also be entitled to seek punishment of the appellants in terms of Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, on account of the appellants having failed to, omit to comply with its order.  An offence punishable under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, is committed as soon as there is a failure or omission to comply with the order passed by a consumer forum.  A reference this regard can be made to the decision rendered by a Three-Member Bench of this Commission in EA/80/2016 Rajnish Kumar Rohtagi & Anr. Vs. M/s. Unitech Ltd. & Anr. & connected matters whereby the larger Bench interalia held as under:
(1)     A company, or a partnership firm, which fails or omits to comply with any order made by a District Forum, State Commission or National Commission, as the case may be, will be liable to the penalty prescribed in Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act.
","(2)     The date on which the order is passed by the District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be shall be deemed to be the date on which the offence under Section 27 of the C.P. Act is committed.  The said offence will be deemed to continue till the order passed by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission is complied in all respects.
5.      For the reasons stated hereinabove the appeals are allowed and the order of the State Commission to the extent of penalty of Rs 50,000/- for dishonour of each cheque was imposed upon the appellants is set aside.  It is made clear that the complainant shall be entitled to proceed against the appellants under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 if the appellants had failed or omitted to comply with the order of the State Commission.   The complainants shall also be entitled to seek enforcement of the compromise which they had entered into with the appellants, through the process of the State Commission.  The parties shall appear before the State Commission on the dates already fixed in the execution proceedings. They shall also be entitled to proceed u/s 25(3) of the C.P. Act, if the compromise has still not been honoured.  Since the order imposing penalty of Rs.50,000/- for dishonour of cheque has been set aside the second order of withholding the amount of penalty from out of the amount received through attachment of the bank account of the appellants is also set aside.  The appeals stand disposed of.

The appeal no. 1196 of 2014 and the cross appeal no. 1284 of 2014 have been filed by the complainant as well as by the Opposite party against the common order dated 13.10.2014 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U T Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in Complaint no. 83 of 2014.
2.     Similarly FA no.1197 and the cross appeal no.1285 of 2014 have been filed by the complainant as well as by the opposite party respectively against the order dated 13.10.2014 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, U T Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in Complaint no. 84 of 2014. As the State Commission has passed similar orders in both the complaint case nos. 83 and 84 of 2014, hence, these appeals are being considered together. The parties will be addressed according to their status in the orders of the State Commission. The brief facts of these cases are being given separately as follows:
FA no.1196 of 2014 and FA no.1284 of 2014
3.     The brief facts of the case are that the complainant booked a flat bearing No. 397 on the 3rd Floor with the opposite party on 29.05.2011 for a total sale consideration of Rs.22,50,000/- and for the said flat, allotment letter dated 04.11.2011 was issued to the complainant. An agreement was executed between the parties in respect of the said flat on 04.11.2011. Complainant has paid in total a sum of Rs.21,06,256/- towards the cost of the said flat and the remaining amount was to be paid at the time of handing over the possession of the flat by the opposite party. According to the complainant, the opposite party failed to deliver the possession of the flat in May 2012. The opposite party vide letter dated 06.12.2012 intimated the complainant that possession of the flat shall be delivered on or before 15.01.2013 but failed to do so.
4.     On 11.04.2013, the opposite party asked the complainant to pay the service tax amounting to Rs.61,460/- as per the Government service tax rules which was duly paid by the complainant on 19.06.2013 and receipt dated 19.06.2013 was issued. Complainant personally visited the office of opposite party for the date of delivery of possession but every time only false promises were made by the opposite party. Complainant had prayed in the complaint for directions to the opposite party to pay compensation of Rs.12 lakh along with financial loss of approximately Rs.24 lakhs with interest @ 18% p.a. to the complainant.
5.     The State Commission vide its order dated 13.10.2014 partly allowed the complaint and observed as under:
The opposite party shall refund Rs.18,81,256/- (i.e., Rs.21,06,256/- actually paid minus (-) 10% of Basic Sale Price of Rs.22,50,000/- i.e., Rs.2,25,000/-) along with interest @ 12% per annum from the respective dates of deposits to the complainant;
The opposite party shall also pay cost of litigation to the tune of Rs.15,000/- to the complainant;
The order shall be complied with by the opposite party within 45 days, from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the same, failing which the amount mentioned in clause (i) shall carry interest @ 15% per annum from the respective dates of deposits, instead of @ 12% per annum from the date of filing the complaint, besides payment of cost of litigation.
6.     Hence, the present appeals nos. 1196 and 1284 of 2014.
FA No. 1197 of 2014 and FA no.1285 of 2014
7.     The complainant booked a flat bearing No. 495 on the 4th Floor with opposite party no. 1 (a society created for the welfare of the army officers) for BSP of Rs.22,97,000/- and for the said flat, allotment letter dated 16.06.2011 was issued to the complainant wherein it was directed to pay the amount to opposite party no.2 M/s G B M Developers. An agreement was executed between the parties in respect of the same flat on 17.08.2011. The complainant has paid in total Rs.21,31,251/- towards the said flat. According to the complainant, the opposite party has failed to deliver the possession of the flat in May 2012.  The opposite party vide their letter dated 06.12.2012 intimated the complainant that the possession of the flat shall be delivered on or before 15.01.2013 but failed to do so.
8.     The opposite party vide letter dated 18.02.2013 again made an offer of possession. Complainant personally visited the office of the opposite party for the date of delivery of possession but every time only false promises were made by the opposite party. Complainant sent letter dated 08.02.2014 for refund of the deposited amount as the opposite party failed to keep his commitment of delivery of possession.
9.     The complainant had prayed in the complaint to direct the opposite party to pay compensation of 12 lakh along with financial loss of Rs.22,96,500/- from opposite party no.2 & Rs.22,970/- (amount paid at the time of booking) from opposite party no.1 with interest @ 18% p.a. to the complainant.
10.   The State Commission vide its order dated 13.10.2014 partly allowed the complaint and observed as under:
The opposite party no.2 shall refund Rs.19,01,551/- (i.e., Rs.21,31,251/- actually paid minus (-) 10% of Basic Sale Price of Rs.22,97,000/- i.e., Rs.2,29,700/-) along with interest @ 12% per annum from the respective dates of deposits to the complainant;
The opposite party no.2 shall also pay cost of litigation to the tune of Rs.15,000/- to the complainant;
The order shall be complied with by the opposite party no.2 within 45 days, from the date of receipt of a certified copy of the same, failing which the amount mentioned in clause (i) shall carry interest @ 15% per annum from the respective dates of deposits, instead of @ 12% per annum from the date of filing the complaint till realization, besides payment of cost of litigation.
","The complaint qua opposite party no.1 is dismissed with no order as to costs.
11.   Hence, the appeals nos.1197 and 1285 of 2014.
12.   As the facts as well as the orders passed by the State Commission are similar in both the complaint cases, complaint no. 83 of 2014 leading to appeal nos. 1196 and 1284 of 2014 will be taken as the lead case.
13.   Learned counsel for the complainant has stated that in the present case, the State Commission has deducted the earnest money without any reason as per clause 3 of the Builder Buyer Agreement whereas in similar case no. CC/41/2014 (In FA no.457 of 2014), the State Commission has ordered for refund of the total amount paid by the complainant along with 12% per annum interest.
14.   Learned counsel for the appellant has further stated that EMIs for the housing loan were deducted from complainant’s account & other deductions on several counts also, which caused great financial loss to the complainant. Deficiency in service has been shown by the OP by not providing the complete possession of the flat with basic and other amenities as promised by the opposite party. Even, no NOC from the fire department was provided. The license of the respondent had expired on 13.4.2009 and the innocent purchasers of the flats were misled into buying. This clearly shows unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party.
15.   On the other hand, the learned counsel for the opposite party has stated that the State Commission has given a clear finding that the flat was ready for possession but the complainant did not come forward to take the possession and therefore, as per clause 3 of the builder buyer agreement, the earnest  money is required to be deducted. Otherwise also, no proper explanation or reason has been given by the complainant for seeking refund when the flat was already ready and offer of possession was already given.
16.   It was further argued that once it is conclusively held that there was no deficiency of service, the State Commission had no jurisdiction to award the refund of the amount paid by the complainant. Further, there are no findings as to how OP has earned high profits. Under the contract, it is the sole right of OP to opt either for cancellation or for charging the prescribed rate of interest.
17.   I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. In the present case, the State Commission has given a finding which reads as under:
“The next question that falls for consideration, is as to whether, the complainant is entitled to compensation, for mental agony and physical harassment, allegedly caused at the hands of the opposite party. As stated above, the complainant had been offered possession of the flat, in question, by the opposite party, vide letter dated 06.12.2012, followed by reminders dated 18.02.2013 and 14.05.2013 on payment of the balance amount yet, he did not come forward to take the same, for the reasons best known to him. Thus, under these circumstances, it could not be said that the complainant suffered any mental agony or physical harassment. However, interest @ 12% per annum awarded on the amount of Rs.18,81,256/- to be refunded by the opposite party will take care of the financial loss, suffered by the complainant. It is, therefore, held that the complainant is not entitled to any compensation, as claimed by him, on account of mental agony and physical harassment, in the circumstances referred to above”.
18.    It has been argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that in similar circumstances in complaint no. 41 of 2014 leading to FA no.457 of 2014, the State Commission has not deducted the earnest money to the tune of 10% of the consideration whereas in the present case, the State Commission has ordered deduction of the same. I have perused the papers filed in appeal no. 457 of 2014 against CC no.41 of 2014 and it is found that no offer of possession was issued by the opposite party to the complainant. In fact, in that case the opposite party has only informed vide letter dated 06.12.2012 that the possession will be handed over on or before 15.01.2013 and the party was invited for inspection. However, when subsequent letters were issued to the complainant, no offer of possession was actually sent to the complainant. Thus, the complainant in that case filed complaint for refund of the amount. In contrast, in the present case, after issuance of the letter dated 06.12.2012, the opposite party issued further reminders on 18.02.2013 and 14.05.2013 where offer of possession was clearly given. Thus, the facts of the two cases are different and the argument of the learned counsel for the complainant cannot be accepted.
19.   From the observations made by the State Commission, it is clear that the State Commission has given a clear finding that the complainant did not take the possession without any justifiable reason and I agree with the same. Builders build the houses on the money received from the allottees and the amount paid by the allottees is invested in the project. However, if some allottees want their money back, the project suffers to the detriment of other allottees. Keeping this in view, I do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the State Commission.
20.   So far as the points raised in the appeal being FA no. 1284 are concerned, it is seen that when the allotment was cancelled by the opposite party, the opposite party should have refunded the amount as per the agreement, however, no amount was refunded to the complainant and therefore, the State Commission has passed the order for refund of the amount. As no time limit was mentioned for handing over the possession, an allottee cannot wait for an indefinite period for getting the possession. No advantage of the fact that there was no time limit of for handing over the possession can be given to the opposite party. In fact, this itself is a deficiency in service. Moreover, the State Commission has already passed an order for deduction of the earnest money which is as per the agreement. As the money remained with the opposite party for quite some time, the complainant is entitled to get interest on this amount as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Alok Shanker Pandey Vs. Union of India & Ors., II (2007) CPJ 3 (SC) as under:-
“9.  It may be mentioned that there is misconception about interest.  Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but it is the normal accretion on capital.  For example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10 years ago, but he offers that amount to him today, then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount.  Had A paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B would have invested that amount somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on it for this period.  Hence equity demands that A should not only pay back the principal amount but also the interest thereon to B.”
21.    Coming to the question of rate of interest, the State Commission has ordered refund of the amount after deducting the earnest money along with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of receipt of deposits. As the earnest money has already been deducted as per the agreement, the rate of 12% per annum seems to be reasonable.
22.   Based on the above discussion, I do not find any merit in the FA no. 1196 of 2014 and FA no. 1284 of 2014 filed by the complainant and by OP respectively against the order dated 13.10.2014 passed by the State Commission in CC no. 83 of 2014. As FA no. 1197 and 1285 of 2014 have been filed against the similar order dated 13.10.2014 passed by the State Commission in CC no. 84 of 2014, they are also dismissed on the same grounds. The order of the State Commission be complied by the opposite party within 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

The Complainant/Petitioner took a car loan of ₹1,30,000/- from the Respondent Indusind Bank.  The loan was repaid on 25.01.2012 by making payment of ₹1,14,000/- in terms of one time settlement between the parties.  The grievance of the Complainant/Petitioner is that despite she having repaid the loan,
-2-
the requisite loan clearance certificate was not issued to her by the Bank, as a result of which she could not sell the car.  This is also the case of the Petitioner that despite she having repaid the entire loan in terms of the settlement, a demand of ₹12,150/- was raised by the Respondent Bank on 09.03.2015.  The Complainant, thereafter, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint seeking compensation etc.
2.      The Respondent did not file any written version to the Consumer Complaint.  The District Forum vide its order dated 16.05.2018 directed the Respondent to pay a sum of ₹10,000/- as litigation expenses to the Complainant.  No compensation was, however, awarded to her.
3.      Being aggrieved from the order of the District Forum, the Petitioner/Complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an Appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 07.06.2019, the State Commission also awarded compensation quantified at ₹5,000/- to the Complainant/Petitioner.  Being still dissatisfied with this, the Complainant is before this Commission.
4.      The only question involved in this Petition is as to whether the compensation awarded by the State Commission to the

Petitioner/Complainant is adequate or not.  The learned Amicus Curiae submits that though the loan was repaid on 25.01.2012, the requisite clearance certificate came to be issued to the Complainant only on 01.02.2018.  Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case including the mental agony and harassment suffered by the Complainant/Petitioner on account of the Respondent having not issued the requisite clearance certificate for years together, the Respondent is directed to pay a sum of ₹40,000/- as compensation to the Complainant in addition to the cost of litigation awarded by the District Forum.  The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.

This revision petition is directed against the order of the State Commission dated 02.04.2018 whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner against the order of the State Commission was dismissed.
2.      The complainant/petitioner was allotted a residential plot by Laghu Vetan Kalyan Co-operative Housing Society and a Sale Deed of the plot was also executed in his favour.  He was unable to raise construction on the said plot, he having been transferred out of Jabalpur.  The case of the complainant/petitioner is that in June, 2012, when he visited the allotted plot, he found one Shailendra Gupta raising construction on the said plot.  On enquiry, he informed the complainant that the plot had been purchased by him from Ravindra Kumar Vishwakarma, respondent no.2 in the Consumer Complaint.  Being aggrieved, the complainant/petitioner approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint impleading the Chairman of the Society as well as both Mr. Shailendra Gupta and Mr. Ravindra Kumar Vishwakarma as the OPs in the complaint.
3.      The complaint was dismissed by the District Forum, in limine without any notice to the respondents.  Being aggrieved, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The said appeal having been dismissed, he is before this Commission.
","4.      The appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed by the State Commission on the ground that since he came to know of the allotment by another person way back in the year 2002, Consumer Complaint instituted in 2012 was patently barred by limitation.  Reliance before the State Commission was placed on a complaint made by the complainant/petitioner to the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur on 24.11.2012.
5.      I have carefully perused the complaint which the complainant/petitioner made to the Superintendent of Police, Jabalpur.  Nowhere in the complaint has he stated that he had come to know of the allotment to Mr. Shailendra Gupta or some other person prior to June 2012.  He clearly stated in the Consumer Complaint that it was in June 2012 when he went to Jabalpur, visited the allotted plot, he found Mr. Shailendra Gupta raising construction on the plot which had been allotted to him.  Having been instituted in the year 2012, the complaint cannot be said to be barred by limitation if the complainant came to know of the possession of Mr. Shailendra Gupta only in June 2012.  Therefore, fora below were not justified in dismissing the Consumer Complaint without any notice to the respondent.  The fora below, in my opinion, ought to have admitted the complaint, issued notice to the respondents and then decided the Consumer Complaint on merits considering all such plea which the respondents would raise in their written version.
As far as the alleged fraud is concerned, again in the facts and circumstances of the case, the District Forum ought not to have dismissed the Consumer Complaint on merits since the case of the petitioner/complainant was that the plot which had been allotted to him by the society and for which a Sale Deed had been executed in his favour, was later sold by the society to a third person.
6.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order is set aside.  The Consumer Complaint is admitted, subject to just exceptions and it is remitted back to the District Forum to proceed with the same in accordance with law.  It is made clear that while deciding the Consumer Complaint, the respondents shall be entitled to take all such plea as may be open to them in law including the plea of limitation if they so desire.
The parties are directed to appear before the concerned District Forum on 18.03.2020.

","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Union Bank of India against the order dated 02.02.2015 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Karnataka (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Appeal No.126/2011.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that complainant/respondent is a partnership firm carrying out the business of distribution of pharmaceutical products. Complainant obtained credit loan facility with opposite party and as per the condition of loan, stock-in-trade of the complainant were hypothecated to opposite party vide hypothecation agreement dated 21.07.2004. Bank used to deduct the premium amount regularly from the account of complainant and paid the same to insurance company.  On 7.6.2008/8.6.2008, there was theft in the shop and goods worth Rs.6,58,647/- were stolen. Immediately, complainant lodged an FIR at Police Station.  After the investigation, the police have submitted  the final report to the Prl. Civil Judge and JMFC Raichur. As the stolen goods were not recovered, the complainant wrote a letter dated 21.4.2009 to opposite party and urged to pay a sum of Rs.6,58,647/- through insurance company. Complainant came to know that opposite party had failed to renew the insurance policy and as such, the insurance was not in force as on the date of commission of theft. The complainant then filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum against the opposite party Bank. District Forum vide order dated 30.08.2010 dismissed the complaint as there was no deficiency in services on the part of the opposite party.  Aggrieved with the order of the District Forum the complainant preferred an appeal before the State Commission.  State Commission vide its order dated 02.02.2015 allowed the appeal of the complainant and directed OP to pay a sum of Rs.6,58,647/- with interest @ 12% p.a.
3.      Hence the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties.  The learned counsel for the petitioner stated that as per hypothecation agreement it is the duty of the loanee that he should get the hypothecated goods insured as per Clause 10(i) of the hypothecation agreement, which reads as under:-
“10 (i)       The Borrower shall at all times during the continuance of this security and from time to time insure the said goods and keep them insured against loss or damage by fire, lightening, riot, civil commotion, strike or any other risks as may be required by the Bank or by law in the joint names of the Borrower and the Bank with insurance companies previously approved of in writing by the Bank to the extent of at least 10% in excess of full marketable value of the said goods as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion and punctually pay the premia due for such insurance and that the cover note/s, insurance policy/polices or certificate/s shall be delivered to the Bank.
5.      The clause 10(ii) of the Hypothecation agreement reads as under:
“10. (ii) if the Borrower fails to effect such insurance the Bank may, but without being bound to do so, insure the said goods against any one or more of the aforesaid risks as may be deemed necessary by the Bank in its absolute discretion either in its sole name or in the joint names of the Borrower and the Bank and debit the premia and other charges to such account or accounts as aforesaid.”
6.      Learned counsel argued that from above clause it is clear that the bank will get the insurance if the borrower fails to insure the hypothecated goods.  However, it is not the primary duty of the bank to get the hypothecated goods insured.  The District Forum has correctly appreciated the facts of the case and the law involved in the matter and has rightly dismissed the complaint.  The State Commission, however, has allowed the complaint observing the deficiency in service on the part of the bank.  The bank is not the insurer and even if there is some deficiency on the part of the bank, insurance amount cannot be ordered to be paid to the complainant.  Moreover, the loss has not been assessed by any surveyor and the State Commission has allowed the total claim of the complainant as asked by the complainant.
7.       In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the following judgments:-
“1. HDFC Bank Ltd. Vs. Kumari Reshma & Ors., AIR 2015 SC 290.
2. Sutlej Industries Ltd. Vs. Punjab National Bank, FA No.306 of 2012, decided on 08.11.2017 (NC)
3. Union Bank of India & anr. Vs. M/s. Learning Spiral Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., RP No.1750 of 2017, decided on 30.07.2018.”
8.      On the other hand learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that the bank was taking the insurance every year and was deducting the premium from the loan account of the respondent.  However, the bank did not take the insurance policy after October, 2007 and theft occurred on June, 2008 and thus, the goods hypothecated were not covered under the insurance at the time of theft.  As the bank was taking insurance for the hypothecated goods every year, it was expected of them to have taken insurance after 2007 also.  The hypothecation agreement, though states that borrower will arrange for the insurance but, as the bank was arranging insurance on their own after deducting the premium from the loan account of the complainant, there was no occasion for the complainant to have taken the insurance independently. Otherwise also clause 10(ii) requires that if the borrower does not take insurance then the bank will take the insurance for the hypothecated goods.  Thus, the bank has failed in its duty to take the insurance for hypothecated goods and the bank is liable to recoup the loss suffered by the complainant as a result of theft.  The State Commission has rightly decided that there was deficiency in service on the part of the bank and the amount involved in the theft has rightly been ordered to be paid by the bank to the complainant.
9.      In support of her contention, the learned counsel for the respondent referred to the following judgments:-
“1. Rajgarh Sehore Kshtriya Gramin Bank Vs. Ramgopal & Ors, III (2006) CPJ 300 (NC)
2.  Shree Kalyan Ayurvedic Pharmacy Vs. Commercial Co-operative Bank Ltd., IV (2007) CPJ 127 (NC)
3. Corporation Bank Vs. Sandhya Shenoy & Ors., I (2009) CPJ 34 (NC).”
10.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and examined the record.  From the record, it is seen that the bank had taken the insurance in the year 2005 and premium was paid in October, 2005.  Next year also the premium was paid in  October, 2006 and the insurance was valid till October 2007. However, it seems that no premium has been paid after October, 2007 and theft happened in June, 2008 when the hypothecated goods were not covered under insurance.  Clearly, the clause 10(i) of the hypothecation agreement casts duty on the borrower to take the insurance for the hypothecated goods in the joint name of the bank and the borrower.  Thus, the primary duty to obtain the insurance of the hypothecated goods is of the borrower and Clause 10(ii) of the hypothecation agreement only provides that if the borrower does not obtain the insurance of the hypothecated goods as per clause 10(i), then the bank may, but without being bound to do so, insure the said goods.  Thus, it is clear that the bank is not bound to get the hypothecated goods insured, but the bank in its interest may insure the said goods.  Thus, two things are clear from clause 10 (i) & (ii).  The first is that it is the primary duty of the borrower to obtain the insurance for the hypothecated goods and the second is that the bank has discretion to obtain the insurance for the hypothecated goods, if the borrower does not insure the same. In Syndicate Bank Vs. Nagarath Mechanical works and Anr. Appeal No.166 of 2006 decided on 31.05.2011, 2011 (3) CPC 376 (NC) this Commission observed that bank will not be liable for purchase of insurance policy on behalf of the borrower.  Similarly in HDFC Bank Ltd. Vs. Kumari Reshma AIR 2015 SC 290, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that if the borrower failed to insure the vehicle it was absolute fault of owner not the fault of the financer.  In Central Bank of India Vs. Jagbir Singh Civil Appeal No.3645 of 2015 decided on 16.04.2015 the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India held that financer/bank is not liable for purchase/renewal of Insurance policy.   Thus, even though in the year 2005 and 2006 the premium were deducted by the bank and paid to the insurance company to get insurance, however, in October, 2007 no premium was deducted by the bank and the insurance could not be taken.  The complainant also did not bother to effect insurance from October, 2007 till June, 2008.  Thus, complainant has also been negligent in the present case and the total responsibility cannot be loaded on the bank only.
11.    I agree with the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the bank is not the insurer and under Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the compensation is to be granted on the basis of the deficiency in service if any. This Commission in FA No.601 of 2012, State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur vs. M/s. Jaishree Industries & Ors. Decided on 18.09.2018 (NC) has reduced the liability of the bank to Rs.8,00,000/- and liability of Insurance Company as nil in a case where the bank and the Insurance Company were held jointly liable to pay the insurance amount of Rs.36,89,345/- as the bank had not corrected the address of the work place.
12.    Based on the above discussion, I find that the complainant has been equally negligent in insuring the hypothecated goods as per Clause 10(i) of the hypothecation agreement. Legally the bank is safe in the light of Clause 10(ii) of the hypothecation agreement.  However, as the bank was taking insurance for the last two years, it was expected that the bank should have continued with the renewal of insurance.  Thus, both the parties have been negligent in getting the hypothecated goods insured.  In these circumstances, the bank cannot be asked to compensate the complainant for the total loss suffered, this is another matter that even this loss of Rs.6,58,647/- has not been assessed by any competent person like a surveyor.  This being a case of contributory negligence, in my view, a compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- will be reasonable and sufficient.  I also find no justification for awarding 12% p.a. interest on the amount of compensation.  In my view, interest @8% p.a. shall be sufficient and reasonable.
13.    The revision petition No.3027 of 2015 is thus, partly allowed and the petitioner bank is directed to pay Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation to the respondent/complainant instead of Rs.6,58,647/- as ordered by the State Commission.  The bank shall also pay interest @8% p.a. on this amount of Rs.2,00,000/- from the date of filing of the complaint i.e. 18.05.2010 instead of 12% p.a. as ordered by the State Commission.  This order be complied by the petitioner bank within 45 days of the receipt of this order.  The bank will also pay Rs.20,000/- (rupees twenty thousand only) as cost of litigation to the complainant.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

The present revision petition has been filed by C S Vision Enterprises against the judgment dated 26.05.2015 of the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Panchkula (‘the State Commission’) in First Appeal no.302 of 2015.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that Ishwar Singh – complainant (respondent no.1 herein) filed a complaint stating that he owned agriculture land measuring 24 Kanals comprising Khasra nos.49/16/2, 17, 18, 19/1 situated in village Balawas, Tehsil and District Hissar. The land was very fertile. With the intervention of District Horticulture Officer, Hissar, the work for installation of poly house over an area of 1600 square metres was allotted to C S Vision Enterprises – OP nos. 2 (appellant). A tri party agreement was also entered into. The complainant paid a sum of Rs.7,70,500/- to the appellant – OP no.2. The OPs did not complete the installation of poly house and left in between, thus causing loss to the complainant in the shape of not being able to cultivate the land, besides loss of interest on the amount paid to the OPs by raising loan. He filed complaint under section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
3.     The opposite parties did not contest the complaint and were proceeded ex parte.
4.     The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Hissar (‘the District Forum’) vide its order dated 20.02.2015 allowed the complaint directing the opposite parties as under:
“This complaint is hereby allowed, with a direction to the opposite parties to refund Rs.7,70,500/- to the complainant with interest @ 18% per annum from respective dates of different deposits, till payment. Complaint is also hereby awarded crop loss of Rs.2,50,000/- with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing the complaint, i.e., 11.11.2013 till payment. Complainant is hereby further allowed damages to Rs.50,000/- for his harassment, mental agony etc., and litigation expenses of Rs.2200/- against the opposite parties who shall be jointly and severally liable to comply the order.
Since, primary responsibility to comply the order shall be opposite party no.2 so in case compliance is made by opposite party no.1, then opposite party no.1 shall be at liberty to be duly indemnified by opposite party no.2 with interest @ 9@ per annum.”
5.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner herein preferred an appeal being FA no. 302 of 2015 before the State Commission. The State Commission vide its order dated 26.05.2015 dismissed the appeal.
6.     Hence, the present revision petition.
7.     Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the respondent no.1/ complainant. None appeared to argue on behalf respondent no.2, i.e., the District Horticulture Officer. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the State Commission as well as the District Forum, Hissar ought to have considered the fact that the complainant/ respondent no.1 had demanded only compensation for loss to his crop and mental harassment and agony, but the fora below have directed the petitioner to return the amount taken for construction of poly house which was not even asked for by the complainant/ respondent no.1.
8.     The State Commission has committed a grave error by passing the order without appreciating the actual facts and law involved and has wrongly interpreted that the petitioner is liable to refund the amount taken by him from respondent no.1 as the inspection seems to have been carried out after a year of the installation and it was not the duty of the petitioner to maintain the poly house as the same was handed over to respondent no.1  after due inspection by the officers of the Horticulture department. It is the respondent no.1 who has not paid the complete amount of his share to the petitioner and thus the findings recorded by the District Forum are unjustified and incorrect and deserve to be interfered with.
9.     The State Commission has committed error in passing the impugned order as it has also not considered the facts as ignored by the District Forum that there may be collusion between respondent and other officials who have given report about the damage caused to the poly house and have not looked into the facts that since there was damage it was actually built by the petitioner and had the petitioner not completed his work, he would not have received the subsidy from the Government, which was released from time to time  after inspections by team of officials.
10.   The State Commission as well as the District Forum has ignored the fact that the respondent no.1 does not fall within the definition of consumer and it is a purely commercial transaction. As per clause 10.7 and 10.08 the complainant had an option for redressal of dispute by way of arbitration neither there is any proof for the payment of Rs.7,70,000/- nor there is any reasoning to award the same in favour of respondent no.1 and there is no explanation in the orders of the Fora below as to how there was a deficiency in service.
11.   It has also been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the construction of poly house was completed as per the scheme and the relevant officials gave their reports on completion of the poly house then only the subsidy was released in the present case. Once the departmental officials have expressed their satisfaction on the completion of the poly house then it cannot be said that the petitioner did not complete the construction of the poly house.
12.   On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent no.1/ complainant has stated that both the fora below have given a concurrent finding of facts and therefore, scope under the revision petition is quite limited in such matters as the facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission against the concurrent findings. Both the fora below have clearly observed that there was total loss to the poly house apart from the loss to the crop and therefore, the complainant is entitled to refund of his amount that was paid to the petitioner.
13.   It was further stated that the construction of the poly house was left without completing the poly house and thus the petitioner is totally responsible for the damage to the crop as well as damage to the poly house. The material used in the poly house was very bad. The District Forum has appointed an Executive Engineer of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University, Hissar as Local Commissioner to visit the spot and prepare the report about the status of the poly house. The report was given by Shri Abhay Ram, Executive Engineer (CI), the concluding para of which reads as under:
“Conclusion:
One structure of poly house was fully damaged and its structural elements were lying on the ground. Other poly houses were in SWAY position with poor quality polythene having frequent holes. Other structures may collapse at any time with low/high velocity wind and may cause loss to the lives. Mainly structure failure is due to use of lesser dia GI pipers in frames, improper joints, improper Angle Brackets and poor worksman ship. Damage of polythene sheet is due to its lesser thickness, poor quality and not being as per specifications”.
14.   From the above, it is amply clear that improper material was used and the construction was not properly carried out which lead to the total damage to poly house within a period of one year. Thus, the complainant has suffered loss and the petitioner is responsible for compensating that loss.
15.   I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record. In the complaint, the complainant has alleged that an amount of Rs.7,70,500/- has been paid to the petitioner herein on different dates on the instruction of respondent no.2, i.e., District Horticulture Officer. The District Forum and the State Commission have found deficiency on the part of the petitioner herein and ordered refund of this amount to the complainant. The District Forum had appointed an expert to look into the construction of the poly house and the expert being an Executive Engineer of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University, Hissar working as Local Commissioner visited the spot and prepared the report about the status of the poly house. This report gives an unambiguous finding that the material used for construction of the poly house was not proper and the construction was very poor in quality and workmanship.
16.   Learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that there was no relief sought by the complainant in respect of poly house rather the only relief sought was in respect of crop loss, but both the fora below have awarded the cost of poly house which was paid by the complainant to the petitioner. It has also been stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that inspection of the poly house was done after a period of one year and it was not the duty of the petitioner to maintain the poly house, rather it was the responsibility of the complainant himself.
17.    Regarding deficiency in service it is seen that the construction of the poly house was not complete and the inspection was done by an expert which revealed that the construction was not upto the mark. Thus, this is a clear case of deficiency in service covered under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
18.   It has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complainant is not a consumer as the whole transaction was for commercial purpose. No proof has been filed by the petitioner that transaction was commercial in nature. The complainant had obtained the services of the petitioner for construction of poly house. The complainant is not dealing in the trade or business of poly houses, therefore, no commercial purpose can be attributed in the service from the petitioner/ OP.  Even if it was expected that the complainant would get some additional income from his agricultural field after the construction of the poly house, this will only come as part of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment. The complainant has not made any other averment in the complaint in this regard and therefore, the presumption would be that the service of the opposite party was obtained for earning livelihood by means of self-employment. In taking this view, I am supported by the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Paramount Digital Color Lab & Ors. etc., Vs. Afga India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. etc. III (2018) CPJ 12 (SC) wherein the following has been observed:-
“13. Thus, in our considered opinion, each case ought to be judged based on the peculiar facts and circumstance of that case. Whether the assistance of someone is required to handle the machine, is a question of fact and necessity? Ultimately, if it is purely for a “commercial purpose” and not for “self-employment”, the complainant may not get the benefit of the Explanation to Section 2 (1)(d) of the Act. The buyers of the goods or commodities for “self-consumption” in economic activities in which they are engaged would be “consumers” as defined in the Act. Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show that the appellants wanted to use the machine in question for purposes other than “self-employment”.
Therefore, the point to be considered is whether the appellants have purchased the machine in question for “commercial purpose” or exclusively for the purposes of earning their livelihood by means of “self-employment”. There cannot be any dispute that the initial burden is on the appellants to prove that they fall within the definition of “consumer”. It is pertinent to mention that respondent No. 4, who is a contesting party, did not choose to file a counter affidavit before the State Commission. In other words, he did not deny any of the claims made by the appellants. None of the parties have led their evidence. Based on the material on record before the State Commission, it proceeded to decide on merits. As the litigation is being fought since 2006 in different Forums, we do not wish to remand the matter, particularly, when there is sufficient material available on record for arriving at the conclusion.”
19.     So far as objection of the learned counsel for the petitioner with regard to arbitration clause is concerned, this Commission in the case of Aftab Singh and Ors vs EMAAR MGF Land Ltd. and Ors., decided on 13th July 2017 has already decided that even if there is an arbitration clause in the agreement a consumer forum will have jurisdiction to decide the complaint. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has upheld this judgment of this Commission, therefore, I do not find any merit in the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner.
20.   Clearly this is a matter where poly house has been constructed under a Government scheme providing subsidy for the same. It is also clear that the poly house was constructed and approved for subsidy by the concerned officials of the Horticulture Department. It is a clear case where the subsidy has been usurped by constructing a poly house with low quality material and improper specifications as well as with bad workmanship. The farmer has not got the real benefit of this scheme though he has paid Rs.7,70,500/- for the construction of the poly house. Both the fora below have agreed that the amount paid by the complainant be refunded to the complainant by the petitioner. Hear, it is important to observe that the complainant has not asked for refund of the amount paid to the petitioner for construction of the poly house. He has only asked for compensating the loss suffered by him due to crop failure on account of bad quality of poly house. It seems that impliedly, the complainant wants to retain the poly house as he is also a beneficiary under the scheme where the Government subsidy is involved. Otherwise also, it is necessary that the poly house is rebuilt for the benefit of the farmer as per the provisions of the scheme. Refund of the amount paid by the complainant is not a solution in the present case, because, the complainant/ farmer has not got the benefit of the poly house/ scheme and even the Government subsidy has not served its purpose. Therefore, it is required that the poly house is rebuilt by the petitioner as per the specifications of the scheme with certification from the District Horticulture Officer within a specified time.
21.   Based on the above discussion, it is ordered that the petitioner will rebuilt the poly house as per the specifications of the scheme from his own funds to the satisfaction of the complainant and the District Horticulture Officer within a period of four months from the date of receipt of this order. The District Horticulture officer/ respondent no.2 shall give a certificate of successful completion of the poly house as per the provisions of the scheme to the complainant as well as to the petitioner. However, if the petitioner fails to reconstruct the poly house as per this order, then after a period of four months from the date of receipt of this order, the petitioner will be liable to pay Rs.7,70,500/- along with 9% interest per annum from the date of respective deposits till actual refund to the complainant and in that case, the District Horticulture Officer shall recover the subsidy paid for this poly house. A copy of this order be sent to the District Magistrate/ District Collector Hissar, for recovering the subsidy in case need arises as per this order. As the interest @ 9% has been allowed on the amount of Rs.2,50,000/- as compensation for crop loss, separate compensation of Rs.50,000/- is not justified and the order of the District Forum in respect of compensation of Rs.50,000/- is set aside. The order of the District Forum stands modified accordingly and consequently the order of the State Commission. The order of District Forum in respect of crop loss compensation and the cost of litigation be complied with by the petitioner within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of this order.
","22.   Accordingly, the revision petition no. 2091 of 2015 is disposed of in terms of the above order. However, it is to be listed for reporting compliance by the petitioner and District Horticulture Officer/ respondent no.2 on 29th July 2020.

","1.       The present Revision Petition is filed by the Petitioner under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Circuit Bench at Nagpur (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Appeal No. A/03/391dated 16.08.2013.
2.       Petitioner/Complainant purchased S-324 Sonalika Tractor fitted with Simpson Engine manufactured by Respondent No.3/Opposite Party No.3. As per the brochure issued by Respondent No.1/Opposite Party No.1, the capacity of the engine of the Tractor was 40 HP. As the performance of the tractor was not as per the published specification, the Complainant requested the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P. for intimating the capacity of the engine. The said institute informed that power take off test horsepower ranged between 33.3 Ps to 33.9 Ps. Finding the capacity of the engine was lower than the capacity declared by the Opposite Parties, Consumer Complaint was filed before the District Forum with the following prayer: -
“i.        Refund of the amount paid to the respondents Rs.2,04,000/-
ii.         Compensation for physical and mental torture Rs.2,50,000/-
iii.       Expenses for inquiry Rs.15,000/-
iv.        Cost of this litigation Rs.5,000/-
v.         Documentation Charges recovered by Respondent No.2 Rs.13,000/-
vi.        Registration/Insurance Rs.8,000/-
-------------------------------
Total    Rs.4,95,500
-------------------------------
3.       Complaint was contested by the Respondent No.3/Opposite Party No.3 that the engine power of the tractor matched with the brochure. The power of the tractor was based on various factors such as air filter, generator, exhaust system, capacity of engine revolution per minute among others, than depending on its use. The District Forum after hearing the parties ordered as follows: -
“(1)    Respondent No.3-International Tractor Limited Sonalika is  directed to discontinue the unfair trade practice and false advertisement about the horse power mentioned in the brochure of Sonalika Tractor.
(2)      Respondent No 1 and 3 are directed to refund the price of the tractor Rs.2,04,500/- at the rate of Rs.12% per annum from 1.10.1999 till realization of the amount to the complainant within one month from the date of order, jointly and severally.
(3)      The respondent No.1 and 3 are directed to pay compensation of Rs.25,000/- for physical mental torture and costs of complaint jointly and severally within one month from receipt of order. Respondent No.1 and 3 are directed to pay compensatory costs Rs.5000/- to respondent No.4 and bear their own costs, within one month from receipt of order.”
4.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum Appeal was filed by Respondent No.3/Opposite Party No.3.
","5.       The State Commission after hearing both the parties and perusing the case record observed that the tractor was used for two years and without understanding the technical terms, Consumer Case was filed before the District Forum and it erroneously allowed the Complaint. The order passed by the District Forum was set aside and Complaint Case No.CC/01/276 was dismissed.
6.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission the Petitioner/Complainant filed the present Revision Petition.
7.       Heard the Petitioner in person, learned Counsel for Respondent No.3 and learned Counsel for Respondent No.4. Respondents No. 1 and 2 were not present. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the State Commission ignored the vital fact that the tractor purchased by the Petitioner was of 32 HP and not 40 HP as mentioned in the brochure. It was also submitted that the State Commission based its order only on the report of Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P., while there were other documents placed on record.
8.       On the other hand, learned Counsel for Respondent No.3/Opposite Party No.3 submitted that the tractor in question was having a capacity of 40 SAE as mentioned in the brochure. It was further submitted that the power of the tractor is based on various factors such as air filter, generator, exhaust system and capacity of engine revolution per minute nature and quality of various components of transmission and purpose for which it is used and operating condition.
9.       The Petitioner wrote a letter to the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P. after two years of purchase of the Tractor. The reply dated 13.09.2001 of Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P. is very relevant in the case, which reads as follows: -
“I am directed to refer your register letter dated 1st Sept. 2001 inquiring about horsepower of Simpson S-324 engine. In this matter you are informed that we are not testing the engine installed on the tractors. However, during the course of tractor testing PTO test is conducted which reflects the engine performance of a tractor. During the course of testing of tractors filed S-324, 3 cylinder engine, the observed PTO horsepower ranged between 33.3 Ps to 33.9 Ps. The overall performance of these engine was found to be satisfactory during the PTO test.”
10.     Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P. very categorically mentioned that they were not testing the engine installed on the tractors. However, on the basis of the ‘power take off test’ the performance of the engine was shown and it ranged between 33.3 Ps to 33.9 Ps. It is also pertinent to note that they mentioned that the overall performance of the engine was found to be satisfactory.
11.     The Mechanical Engineering Research & Development Organization, Ludhiana also issued a certificate that the power of the enginer was SAE-J1995- June 90 rating. While measuring the horsepower accessories like air filter, generator and exhaust system were not included, which meant that the horsepower of the engine would increase. Hence, the capacity of the engine was assessed as 39 HP. The earlier rating BSAU-141: 1971 measuring horsepower was inclusive of air filter, generator and exhaust system.
12.     The different units and terms mentioned by each of the institutes which had tested the engine being different, it is unwise to compare different units and  then jump to a conclusion that the capacity of the engine as mentioned in the brochure was not supported by them. In fact, the Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute, Bundi, M.P. had clearly mentioned that the overall performance of the engine was found to be satisfactory during the PTO test.
13.     In view of the above, the State Commission rightly set aside the order of the District Forum and dismissed the Complaint. Petitioner has failed to point any illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the State Commission, warranting interference in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Revision Petition is accordingly dismissed with no order as to cost.

  For the Respondent      :
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
These Revision Petitions are directed against the order of the State Commission dated 06.09.2018, whereby the appeals preferred by the petitioner against the order of the District Forum were dismissed as barred by limitation.
2.      Three separate Consumer Complaints were instituted against the petitioner company on the allegations that their employee Mr. Ali who later committed suicide, had taken cash advance from them for sale of pre-owned cars to them and thereafter, neither the cars were delivered nor the amounts which he had received from the complainants while working in the pre-owned cars segment of the showroom of the petitioner company, were refunded.
3.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company which denied having received any amount from the complainants.
4.      The District Forum having allowed the Consumer Complaints and having directed refund of the amount alleged to have been paid by the complainants to the respondents through Mr. Ali, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of three separate appeals being Appeals No.296/2014, 297/2013 & 298/2014.  The said appeals were dismissed by the State Commission vide its order dated 27.02.2017 on the ground that the appeals were not in proper form.  The aforesaid order dated 27.02.2017, was not challenged by the petitioner company either before this Commission or before any other Forum.  Rather, three fresh appeals being Appeal No.356/2018, 357/2018 and 358/2018 were filed by the petitioner company on 08.06.2018 challenging the same order of the District Forum.  The appeals having been dismissed as barred by limitation, the petitioner company is before this Commission.
5.      The question involved in these petitions is as to whether there was sufficient cause condoning the delay of more than one year in institution of the appeals no.356/2018, 357/2018 & 358/2018 before the concerned State Commission.  The petitioner had filed applications seeking condonation of delay in filing the said appeals.  The application, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
For the reasons stated in the accompanying affidavit it is humbly prayed that the Hon’ble Commission may be pleased to condone the delay of 465 days in preferring this appeal or the petitioner will have to suffer irreparable injury loss and hardships.
6.      The applications were supported by an affidavit of Ms. Deepa Rajendran, Legal Manager of the petitioner company.  The said affidavit, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
","3.      The aforesaid appeal was dismissed of by the Hon’ble Commission on 27/2/2017 as the same was not in proper form.
4.      The counsel who was entrusted with the case did not convey the facts to the appellant company hence remained without proper information.
5.      The petitioner came to know on 09/04/2018, that the National forum has dismissed the RP No.2840/2012 filed against the order in First Appeal No.581/2011 in a similar and connected case.
6.      Since then the petitioner is verifying to find the position of appeal no.297/2014 and learned that it is dismissed as stated above.  Hence a delay of 465 days occurred in preferring this appeal.
7.      It would thus be seen that the petitioner had sought condonation of delay of more than one year and three months in institution of the appeals solely on the ground that the counsel who had been entrusted with the previously instituted appeals, had not conveyed the facts to the petitioner company.  No affidavit of the advocate who was entrusted with the previously instituted appeals, was filed alongwith the application.  In fact, even the name of the advocate was not given.  I asked the learned counsel for the petitioner company as to whether any complaint had been made by the petitioner company to the concerned Bar Council against the advocate who allegedly failed to inform the petitioner of the dismissal of their previously instituted appeals vide order dated 27.02.2017.  The learned counsel fairly submits that no action against the advocate has been initiated.  In these circumstances, it would be difficult to accept the plea taken by the petitioner company.
8.      As per the practice of every State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, a copy each of the order passed by the said Commission is sent to the each of the parties.  Therefore, as per the usual practice, a copy of the order dated 17.02.2017 would have been sent by the State Commission to the petitioner company.  The learned counsel for the petitioner company submits that no copy of the said order dated 27.02.2017 was received by the petitioner from the State Commission.  However, I find no such averment either in the application or in the affidavit which the petitioner had filed before the State Commission while seeking condonation of delay in institution of the second set of appeals.
9.      Ordinarily, it would be the endeavor of every Court/Forum to decide a matter on merit instead of dismissing it on the ground of limitation.  But, when the delay is abnormal and no logical explanation is forthcoming for condoning such an abnormal delay, it would be a travesty of justice to condone the delay particularly when the order which is sought to be challenged by way of an appeal, came to be passed years before the appeals were instituted.  In the present case, the orders by the District Forum came to be passed in December 2013.  The second set of appeals before the State Commission were filed in June 2018, after about 4½ years of the District Forum having passed the order which the petitioner company wanted to assail before the State Commission.  It has now been more than six years from the date on which the Consumer Complaints were decided by the District Forum.  Considering all the facts and circumstances including (i) the extent of the delay, (ii) the failure to give a convincing ground for c/delay and (iii) the time lag between the order of the District Forum and institution of the second set of appeals, I am not inclined to interfere with the order passed by the State Commission, in exercise of the revisional powers of this Commission u/s 21 of the Consumer Protection Act.  The Revision Petitions are therefore, dismissed.

These are applications seeking impleadment of the legal representatives of the deceased respondent namely Champalal Pareek.  The Learned Counsel appearing for the proposed legal representatives of the deceased respondent/complainant submits that the deceased was survived by his widow, one son and one daughter.  He further submits that one son of the deceased had expired in his life-time and the pre-deceased son of the deceased respondent is survived by three class-I legal heirs, namely Smt. Jamna Devi, Sh. Abhishek and Sh. Bharat.  Hence, Smt. Bhagwati Devi(widow of deceased respondent), Smt. Jamna Devi (widow of pre-deceased son of deceased respondent) , Sh. Abhishek, Sh. Bharat, (sons of pre-deceased son of deceased respondent) Sh. Ajay Pareek (son of deceased respondent) and Smt. Indu Bala (daughter of deceased respondent) are brought on record as the legal representatives of the deceased respondent.  The amended memo. Of parties filed by the proposed legal representatives of the deceased is taken on record.  The applications stand disposed of.
RPs 21, 22, 23, 24 & 25 of 2017.
The petitioner Rajasthan Housing Board advertised a scheme namely Self-Financing Scheme, 2010, for allotment of residential flats in Sector 14 of Chopasini Residential Scheme of Jodhpur.  The said flats were to be known as Marwar Apartments.  It was stated in the Brochure issued by the petitioner, that the area of the Residential Scheme, namely Marwar Apartments was about 22 hectares and 144 apartments were proposed to be constructed under the afore-said Scheme.  The Complainants, in these matters, got themselves registered under the above-referred Scheme advertised by the petitioner Board.  Reservation letters were issued to them in the year 2012, wherein it was inter alia stated that the estimated cost of the apartment would be Rs.17,99,000/-.  The payment was to be made in instalments and the last instalment was to be computed as per the finally decided cost of the apartments.  The complainants made further payment, pursuant to the reservation letters issued to them by the petitioner Board.  Thereafter, allotment letters were issued to them wherein the cost of the apartments was stated to be Rs. 24,80,8000/- Other charges comprising ancillary service charges, lease money, interest on seed money for delayed period wherever applicable, cost of parking and cost of maps were also added to the cost of the apartment.  Instead of making further payment in terms of the allotment letters issued to them the complainants approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking possession of the allotted flats at the cost of Rs. 15,39,836/-.  They also disputed the demand of ancillary service charges, parking charges and service tax.  The maintenance charges demanded by the petitioner board were also disputed by them.  They also sought compensation for the mental agony and harassment which they had to undergo, besides seeking interest on the registration money from the date of deposit till the date of reservation.
2.      The Complaints were resisted by the petitioner Board which inter alia stated in its written version that it proposed to construct 144 multi-storied flats in phase-I under Marwar Apartment Housing Project, for which registrations were made in the years 2008, 2009 and 2010.  The construction commenced in October, 2009 and was completed in March, 2013.  It was also stated in the Written Version that the cost given in the reservation letter was only an estimated cost and the allotment was made on no-profit-no-loss basis, the final cost having been calculated after the construction work had finished.   The  other charges demanded in the allotment letter were also sought to be justified by the petitioner Board.
3.      The District Forum having dismissed the Consumer Complaint, the complainants/respondents approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.  The State Commission having allowed the appeals and having directed refund of the amount which the complainants had deposited with the petitioner Board, along with interest @ 9% p.a., the petitioner Board is before this Commission, by way of these Revision Petitions.
4.      In the impugned order, the State Commission took the view that since only 17 persons were registered under the 2010 SFS Scheme, the said Scheme did not materialize and consequently the complainants were entitled to refund in terms of the Clause 14 of the Brochure issued by the petitioner Board.  The submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that the scheme was never abandoned by the petitioner board and it had actually materialized as would be evident from the reservation letters followed by the allotment letters issued by the petitioner board. The submission of the complainants, on the other hand, is that the left-out flats of 2008 SFS scheme were allotted to them by the board instead of taking up construction of flats under the 2010 SFS scheme.  On a careful perusal of the Brochure, which the Board had issued, it appears to me that though every time applications were invited, the petitioner Board was naming the Scheme as SFS 2008, SFS 2009 and SFS 2010, in fact there was only one project namely Marwar Apartment, Chopasini scheme wherein 144 houses were proposed to be constructed in phase-1 of the Scheme.  Therefore, it would not be correct to say that the Scheme under which registrations were made by the complainants had not materialized.  Had the Scheme not materialized, no reservation followed by allotment would have been made to the complainants, nor would they have made further payments to the petitioner Board, after receipt of reservation letters from the said board.  The complainants did not refuse to make payment in terms of the reservation letters, on the ground that since the Scheme had not materialized they were entitled to refund of the registration money with interest and were not liable to make any payment to the Board in terms of the reservation letters issued by the board.  Therefore, reliance on clause 14 of the Brochure, in my opinion was wholly misplaced.
5.      This is also the submission of the complainants that the estimate cost of the apartments being only Rs.17,99,000/- at the time reservation letters were issued in the year 2012, the final cost could not have escalated to more than Rs. 24,00,000/- per apartment, even if, the other charges demanded by the Board in addition to the cost of the flats are excluded from consideration.  It has come in the written version of the petitioner board that under the allotments were made on no-profit-no-loss basis.  There is no evidence of the petitioner Board having fixed the final price of the apartment in deviation of the no-profit-no-loss basis highlighted in the brochure issued by it.  The cost given in the reservation letter being only tentative cost, the Complainants were under an obligation to accept the final cost determined by the Board on the basis of the actual cost of construction which came to be computed only at the time of allotment letters were issued.  It is not for a Consumer Forum to go into the costing of the apartments allotted by a statutory Board on no-profit-no-loss basis.  The complainants having got themselves registered and having made payment in terms of the Brochure issued by the Board were bound by the terms and conditions contained therein and they cannot seek refund of the registration money unless it is shown that the Scheme had not materialized due to any unforeseen reason.  In any case clause 14 of the Brochure on which reliance is placed by the Complainants applies only to the refund of the registration money and not to the refund of the payments which the Complainants made to the Board after registration had already been made by them and reservation letters were issued to them in the year 2012.
6.      The position as on today is that the Complainants are not ready and willing to accept the flats allotted to them, at the price demanded by the petitioner board from them.  Therefore, they want only refund of the amount which they had paid to the petitioner Board along with appropriate interest on that amount.  Clause 15 (IV) and (VI) of the brochure which are relevant in such a situation read as under:-
“iv. If any applicant requests to refund the reservation amount deposited in this scheme, after depositing the first/second/third/fourth installment of reservation letter, then remaining amount will be refunded to him after deducting 20% of payable amount (registration + reservation amount), without interest.  For example, if the applicant requests to refund the deposited amount after the second installment is due, then remaining registration amount will be refunded to him after deducting 20% of the total amount of registration amount, first instalment amount and second instalment amount, without any interest.  In case if reservation amount is not deposited by applicant then deduction will be made after including the overdue registration amount for calculation of deduction.
vi.      Under above provisions, in any circumstances the maximum deduction will be limited to registration amount of self-financing scheme.”
It would thus be seen that the petitioner Board is entitled to deduct 20% of the registration plus reservation amount from the amounts which the Complainants have deposited with in case they do not want to accept the allotment at the price sought by the petitioner Board but said deduction cannot exceed to registration amount.
7.      Though the Complainants did not specifically request refund of the reservation amount and registration amount, the very fact that they instituted consumer complaints demanding possession of the house for a price of Rs. 15,39,836/- clearly shows that they were not interested in accepting the allotment at the price demanded by the petitioner Board.  Therefore the date on which the consumer complaints were instituted can safely be taken as the date on which the complainants are deemed to have sought refund in terms of clause 15(IV) and (VI) of the brochure.  The  maximum amount which can be deducted out of the amount paid by them to the Board would the registration amount which they had paid to the Board at the time they had got themselves registered under the scheme.
","8.      For the reasons stated above, the Revision Petitions are disposed of with the following directions:-
(i)      the petitioner Board shall refund the entire amount received from the complainants to them,  after deducting the registration money from that amount, along with simple interest @ 9% p.a. on the afore-said balance amount w.e.f. the date of institution of the consumer complaints till the date of refund.
(ii)      The payment in terms of this order shall be made within two months from today.
(iii)     There shall be no order as to costs.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr Pawan Kumar Ray, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr Suresh Rohilla, Advocate 
","This appeal has been filed against the judgment dated 01.08.2017 of the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (‘the State Commission’) in Complaint no. 1064 of 2017 wherein the complaint has been dismissed on the ground of territorial jurisdiction.
2.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties and examined the record. Learned counsel for the appellant states that in the receipt dated 24th October 2013, which was given by OP no.1 for Rs.6.00 lakh, registered office address of OP no.1 is mentioned at Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. Similarly, the petitioner has obtained the details from the Registrar of Companies and it also mentions the Registered Office of OP no.1 as Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. It has been argued that it is the registered office where notice could be served upon. If the registered office of OP no.1 is located at Delhi, the State Commission, Delhi has the territorial jurisdiction for the complaint in question. It has been argued that the State Commission has only considered the question of cause of action that arose at Gurugram. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides three situations for territorial jurisdiction where consumer complaint can be filed and they are mentioned in Section 17 (2) (a), 17 (2) (b) and 17 (2) (c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The State Commission has only considered the situation under section 17 (2) (c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
3.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the opposite parties states that OP no.1 was the intermediary and OP no.1 passed on Rs.6.00 lakh received from the complainant to the builder who is OP No. 4 and this is clearly mentioned in the receipt dated 24.10.2013 which has been signed by the complainant also. He further states that the corporate office of OP no.1 is at Gurugram and the registered office as well as the Corporate Office of OP no.4 is also at Gurugram and the project is also located at Gurugram, therefore, the State Commission, Haryana will only have the territorial jurisdiction for the present complaint. He further states that other OPs are mainly the Directors of these companies and they should not have been made parties in the matter and all the Directors do not reside in Delhi. Learned counsel has mentioned that the money received from the complainant was transferred to OP no.4 and therefore, OP No.4 may refund the money if the complaint is decided in favour of the complainant. From this perspective, it is the OP no.4, who is the main opposite party with which the petitioner has a dispute. OP no. 4 has the registered office and the Corporate Office at Gurugram and therefore, the present complaint is not maintainable before the Delhi State Commission.
4.     I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined the record. Section no. 17 (2) provides for territorial jurisdiction which reads as under:
“17 (2)       A complaint shall be instituted in a State Commission within the limits of whose jurisdiction:-
The opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain; or
Any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the permission of the State Commission is given or the opposite parties who do not reside or carry on business or have a branch office or personally works for gain, as the case may be, acquiesce in such institution; or
The cause of action, wholly or in party, arises.”
","5.     From the above, it is clear that the State Commission has to consider all the three situations while deciding the matter of territorial jurisdiction particularly when the complaint is being dismissed for want of territorial jurisdiction.
6.      Clearly, the cause of action arose at Gurugram, and therefore, 17 (2) (c) is not required to be considered by the Delhi State Commission. As the complaint was filed with the Delhi State Commission they were required to consider whether the territorial jurisdiction is with Delhi State Commission under the provisions of 17 (2) (a) or 17 (2) (b). Clearly 17 (2) (a) is also not applicable in the present matter. One thing is clear that the registered office of OP no.1 is in Delhi, and notice is required to be issued on the address of the registered office as per the Company Law. From this fact, it is clear that the Delhi State Commission has the territorial jurisdiction so far as OP no.1 is concerned.  From this angle also the State Commission should have examined the territorial jurisdiction under section 17 (2) (b) as the territorial jurisdiction is justified for OP no. 1. Thus, before finally rejecting the complaint on the ground of territorial jurisdiction, it is necessary to examine the matter under section 17 (2) (b) also. I do not find any merit in the arguments of the learned counsel for the respondent that the jurisdiction should be considered on the basis of the address of OP No. 4. It is the prerogative of the complainant to file the complaint according to his perception and place the OPs in serial number as he wants, though the serial number is not going to make any difference in the final decision, while passing the order under section 17 (2) (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
7.     In the light of the above discussion, the order of the State Commission dated 01.08.2017 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the State Commission for considering the territorial jurisdiction in the matter under section 17 (2) ( (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
8.     Parties to appear before the State Commission on 3rd February 2020.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :in person 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Sumit Upadhyay, against the order dated 04.04.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Uttar Pradesh, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Appeal No.164 of 2018.
2.      Complainant got admission in opposite party (School) in 11th class & deposited Rs.4,500/- as registration fee. When the complainant went to school to submit school fee, opposite party refused to give concession as promised and pressurised to pay Rs.12,800/- as school fee. Opposite party also gave an option to pay Rs.15,000/- for attending private coaching classes, which complainant refused. Classes were taught by private tutors due to non-availability of science teachers and only to students who had paid coaching fees. So there was no science teacher for 11th class students in school. Complainant was prevented to attend science class as the coaching fee was not paid. Opposite party asked the complainant to take T.C. when approached by complainant for such acts. Opposite party compelled complainant to mention other reason for TC or else the same will not be given.
3.      Aggrieved, complainant filed a complaint bearing No.23 of 2010 in District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Mathura (in short ‘the District Forum’). District Forum has dismissed the complaint that the evidence & records produced are not clear; complainant is free to take legal action in the competent court in the said context.
4.      Appeal bearing No.164 of 2018 was filed. State Commission dismissed the same on the ground that the appeal/complaint against opposite party is not admissible as providing education by educational institution is not a service under Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
5.      Hence, revision petition.
6.      Heard the petitioner in person.  He stated that the District Forum has dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no proof to prove deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party when the complainant was asked to take T.C. and the T.C. was only to be given if actual reason was not  written in the application.  There was no option but to get T.C. anyhow, so that complainant could be admitted in some other school.  On filing the appeal the State Commission has dismissed the appeal on the ground that the student is not a consumer and education institution is not a service provider.  Petitioner stated that the petitioner has not attended the school because there were no teachers particularly for the science subject.  The complainant had not joined the coaching as was being insisted upon by the opposite party.  The petitioner has relied upon the following judgments to emphasise that this Commission has granted relief to the student in such cases:-
“1.   M/s. FIITJEE Limited Vs. Shri Anil Kumar Jain, 2013 SCC OnLine NCDRC 375.
2.     Punjab Technical University Vs. Abhinav Aggarwal & Ors., 2013 SCC OnLine NCDRC 706.”
7.      The petitioner further referred to the judgment of Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad in Km. Surya Shukla and Ors. Vs. State of U.P. and Ors., W.P. No.3173 (MS) of 2005 decided on 4.04.2007.
","8.      I have given a thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the petitioner and have examined the record.  First of all, it is seen that there is a delay of one day in filing the revision petition.  As the delay is only of one day, the same is condoned on the ground mentioned in the application for condonation of delay. The District Forum has dismissed the complaint on the ground that the District Forum has not found any deficiency on the part of the opposite party whereas, the State Commission has dismissed the appeal filed by the complainant on the ground that the student is not a consumer under Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  It is true that Hon’ble Supreme Court in Maharshi Dayanand University Vs. Surjeet Kaur, 2010 (11) SCC 159 has observed that a student is not a consumer and education institution is not a service provider.  This observation has been made in the light of the fact that the consumer forum had passed an order which was against the provisions of the statute governing the university.  In the present case no provision of any statute will be violated if the consumer forum considers the refund of the fees.  It is further seen that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in P.T.Koshy & anr. Vs. Ellen Charitable Trust & Ors., Civil Appeal No.22532 of 2012 decided on 09.08.2012 has observed the following:-
“In view of the judgment of this Court in Maharshi Dayanand University Vs. Surjeet Kaur 2010 (11) SCC 159 wherein this Court placing reliance on all earlier judgments has categorically held that education is not a commodity.  Educational institutions are not providing any kind of service, therefore, in matter of admission, fees etc., there cannot be a question of deficiency of service.  Such matters cannot be entertained by the Consumer Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”
9.      This Commission has taken a view in WLC College India Ltd. Vs. Ajay S. Bhat, RP No.1385 of 2013 decided on 09.02.2016 (NC) as follows:-
12.     …………………I have gone through the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner. I find that in case of Maharshi Dayanand University Vs. Surjeet Kaur (supra) the issue was related to issuance of B.Ed. degree, which can only be issued as per the Rules and Regulations of the concerned University.  Similarly, in the case of Mayank Tiwari Vs. FIITJEE Ltd. RP No.4335 of 2015, decided on 08.12.2014 (NC), the complainant discontinued with his coaching on account of not being satisfied with quality of coaching. In the case of P.T. Koshy & Anr. Vs. Ellen Charitable Trust & Ors., Civil Appeal No.22532 of 2012 decided on 9.8.2012, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has relied on its judgment in case of Maharshi Dayanand University Vs. Surjeet Kaur (supra) and has held that “education is not a commodity.  Educational institutions are not providing any kind of service, therefore, in matter of admission, fees etc., there cannot be a question of deficiency of service.”    The facts of these cases relate to statutory powers and functions of the educational institutions or the quality of education. The facts of the present case relate to the administrative aspects and  are different from the cases cited.”
10.    The observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in respect of fees may be taken as fixation of fees rather than refund of fees.  A case of refund of fees could not be affected by the observations of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as it does not relate to the academic activities of the institutions. From this point of view in this case the opposite party has charged fees only for six months.  The complainant has stated that as per T.C. given the student has attended classes only for 19 days, though actually the student never attended classes as there was no science teacher. In fact, if the complainant had not attended the class even for one month, the opposite party is not entitled to retain the total fees charged.  Clearly, the complainant is not entitled to refund of the whole fees. It is seen that the registration fees of Rs.4,500/- has been paid and the school fees was Rs.12,800/-. As the registration fees was already utilised in the registration of the student, the same cannot be refunded.  However, as the student has attended only for 19 days, at the most, the school can retain 50% of the school fees, therefore, the complainant is entitled to 50% of the school fees. As the amount is very meagre, no notice is being issued to the respondent school and it is ordered that the respondent school shall refund a sum of Rs.6,400/- to the petitioner/complainant along with interest @5% p.a. from the date of issuing of the T.C. till actual payment.  However, as notice is not being issued to the respondent/opposite party and if the respondent is not satisfied with this order, the respondent may approach this Commission for contesting the matter otherwise the order be complied within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of the order.  The revision petition no.2180 of 2019 is accordingly disposed of.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/petitioner purchased a tractor manufactured by respondent No.1 New Holland Fiat  (India) Pvt. Ltd. from its dealer Bharat Tractors and Motors at a price of Rs.8,15,000/- on 21.10.2011. The tractor was delivered to the complainant on 24.10.2011. The complainant alleged defect in the tractor which was delivered to him on 24.10.2011 and, therefore, the said tractor was replaced by another tractor delivered to him on 6.12.2011. The case of the complainant/petitioner is that even the second tractor delivered to him was defective  and had manufacturing defect. The tractor, therefore, was allegedly left in the workshop when it had run for 1800 hours. Alleging manufacturing defect  in the tractor delivered to him, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking the price which he had paid for the tractor with compensation etc.
2.      The complaint was resisted by both – the manufacturer as well as the dealer who denied any manufacturing defect in the tractor.
3.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the respondents approached the concerned State Commission by way of two separate appeals. Vide impugned order dated 21.12.2016 the State Commission allowed the appeals and modified the order of the District Forum by directing the manufacturer to undertake necessary repairs in the tractor and make it roadworthy and operational. However, instead of taking the tractor to the workshop of the respondents for carrying out repairs in terms of the order of the State Commission, the petitioner has approached this Commission by way of these two separate revision petitions.
4.      The only question involved in these petitions is as to whether the tractor which was delivered to the complainant on 6.12.2011 suffered from a manufacturing defect or not. A perusal of the job cards which were issued from time to time when the tractor was taken to the workshop would show that no specific manufacturing defect in the tractor was even reported at the time the tractor was taken to the workshop on 25.12.2012, 29.1.2013, 30.1.2013, 26.5.2013 and 16.10.2013. Only general checkup and oil change was done at the time the tractor was taken on 25.12.2012. There was complaint of water heating and boiling and average being given by the tractor when it was taken to the workshop on 29.1.2013. The endorsement signed by the complainant while taking delivery of the tractor on that date would show that all the repairs were carried out with his knowledge and to his entire satisfaction. There was complaint of head gasket being damaged when the tractor was taken to the workshop on 30.1.2013 and the head gasket was replaced by the workshop without any charges. The tractor was received by the complainant on that date certifying that all the repairs mentioned therein had been carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction. The tractor was thereafter taken to the workshop after about four months on 26.5.2013. The job card shows that the tractor had been hit on the guard assembly which was replaced by the workshop without any charges from the complainant. Again the complainant received the tractor certifying that the repairs were carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction. At the time the tractor was last taken to the workshop on 16.10.2013 after about five months, there was no specific complaint with respect to the tractor and only general checkup was done alongwith change of the engine oil and filter. This time also the complainant received the tractor with the requisite certificate signed by him while receiving the tractor.
5.      The learned counsel for the complainant submits that the engine of the tractor was never replaced by the respondents and it was falsely stated so in the job card dated 26.3.2012. The said contention however cannot be accepted since the job card where replacement of the engine has been recorded was duly signed by the complainant and  in any case no complaint seeking replacement of the engine was made at the time when the tractor was taken to the workshop on the subsequent dates.
6.      It would thus be seen that at no point of time the complainant alleged any manufacturing defect in the tractor which was taken to the workshop several times after it was delivered on 6.12.2011. The only worthwhile complaint was made by him on 29.1.2013 when he complained  of water heating and boiling as well as the average problem. Both the aforesaid problems were duly addressed and the tractor was returned to him on the same day after he had signed a certificate to the effect that the repairs had been carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction.
7.      The complainant did not examine any automobile engineer to prove that the tractor delivered to him by the respondents suffered from a manufacturing defect. The failure of the complainant to examine an automobile engineer or even to file a report from an expert becomes material when viewed in the light of the complaints which he had made at the time when he took the tractor to the workshop of the respondents. Had there been any manufacturing defect in the tractor, it would not have run for 1800 hours, the complainant would certainly have reported the alleged manufacturing defect when he took the tractor to the workshop of the respondents and in any case he would have requested an expert to examine the tractor and give a report pointing out the defects if any in the tractor. That having not been done, the State Commission, in my opinion, was justified in setting aside the order of the District Forum and substituting its order by directing the respondents to carry out the repairs required, if any, in the tractor and make it roadworthy.  Instead of coming to this Commission, the petitioner ought to have taken the tractor to the workshop soon after the order of the State Commission. That having not been done, he must necessarily face the consequences.
","8.      However, in order to ensure substantial justice it  is directed that if the petitioner takes the tractor to an authorized workshop of respondent No.1 New Holland Fiat  (India) Pvt. Ltd. within four weeks and it is found that the tractor has been used only for about 1800 hours, the defects if any in the tractor shall be removed and it will be delivered back to the complainant alongwith certificate from an automobile engineer certifying therein that the tractor is free from any defect and is in a roadworthy condition. Both the revision petitions stand disposed of.

These are the applications seeking condonation of delay in filing the revision petitions by M/s Arjun Gas Service.

REVISION PETITIONS
2.      The complainants in RP/4174/2011, RP/678/2012, RP/857/2013 & RP/2330/2014 were the LPG consumers of Indian Oil Corporation they having taken LPG connection from OP-2 M/s Arjun Gas Service. On 29.6.2007, since the flames coming out of the hot plate burner are rather slow, the complainant allegedly made a complaint to OP-2 M/s Arjun Gas Service and requested them to send a mechanic. At about 5.00-5.30  p.m., OP-1 a mechanic came to the premises of the complainants to repair the hot plate. The case of the complainants is that while working in their premises, OP-1 struck his screw driver against the rubber pipe through which LPG was being supplied from the cylinder to the hot plate. As a result, late Smt. Sushilaben  caught fire. One Ms. Freya, who was a guest to their house tried, tried to come to her rescue but she also got burnt. Smt. Sushilaben  succumbed to the burn injuries on 19.7.2007. Freya was also treated in a clinic for about 10 days and thereafter she was treated as an outdoor patient. The complainants thereafter approached the concerned District Forum by way of  consumer complaints impleading M/s Arjun Gas Service, Pranjal Indane,  Indian Oil Corporation, the mechanic who had come to repair the hot plate, United India Insurance Co. Ltd. from which the insurance policy had been taken by  Indian Oil Corporation and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. from which the insurance policy had been taken by M/s Arjun Gas Service.
3.      The complaints were resisted by the opposite parties. The mechanic claimed that he was a hot plate repairer and when he went to the premises of the complainants, he found that a PVC pipe had been installed from the cylinder to the hot plate. M/s Arjun Gas Service filed their written version claiming that an unauthorised person had been engaged  by the complainants for repair of the hot plate and he was responsible for the accident. M/s Pranjal Indane contested the complaint on the ground that they were not connected with supply of LPG to the complainants and  had no connection with the matter. The insurers also disputed any liability  on their part. The Indian Oil Corporation also contested the consumer complaint.
4.      The District Forum vide its order dated 30.3.2009, dismissed the consumer complaints. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of two appeals. The State Commission vide impugned order dated 29.8.2011 directed as under:-
“ 2. The opponent No.2, 4, 5 and 6 are directed to pay jointly and severally Rs.4,90,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs Ninety Thousand) as compensation to original complainants of Appeal No.87 of 2010 with 9% interest from the date of complaint till realization. The opponent No.2, 4, 5 and 6 are also directed to pay Rs.20,000/- (Rupees Twenty Thousand) towards mental agony and another sum of Rs.5000/-(Rupees Five Thousand) towards the cost of the proceedings.
3. The opponents No.2, 4, 5 and 6 are directed to pay Rs.5,40,485/- (Rupees Five Lakhs Forty Thousand Four Hundred Eighty Five) to the original complaint of Appeal No.88 of 2010 jointly and severally with 9% interest from the date of complaint till realization. The opponents are also directed to pay Rs.5000/- (Rupees Five Thousand) towards the cost of the proceedings.”
5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the petitioners are before this Commission by way of these revision petitions.
6.      As far as the liability of mechanic is concerned, the negligence on his part is clearly established he having worked negligently by striking the screw driver against the rubber pipe which was feeding LPG from the cylinder to the hot plate. Though he took the stand that a PVC pipe had been installed by the complainants, the plea taken by him could not be substantiated by evidence and in any case does not inspire confidence. If on reaching the premises of the complainants, he found the PVC pipe installed there, he ought to have come back instead of trying to repair the hot plate. That having not been done, the plea taken by him seems to be only an afterthought. Moreover, the LPG cylinder had been installed just 20 days ago and it is the standard practice to check the rubber pipe at the time of installing the cylinder. Had PVC pipe been installed by the complainants, the delivery man would have noted so and would have refused to supply the cylinder unless the PVC pipe was replaced by an appropriate rubber pipe. Therefore, OP-1 is liable to compensate the complainants.
7.      As far as M/s  Arjun Gas Service is concerned, there is no  credible evidence to prove that the mechanic was deputed by them to attend to the complaint of the consumers. Though it is alleged by the complainants that they had made a complaint to M/s Arjun Gas Service, it has been denied by the agency and more importantly even by the mechanic. Had he been deputed by M/s Arjun Gas Service, he would have certainly stated so in his written version and that would have made M/s Arjun Gas Service vicariously liable for the acts of negligence committed by him. Without any credible evidence, it cannot be accepted that the mechanic was deputed by M/s Arjun Gas Service. It would be pertinent to note here that according to the mechanic, he was sitting at an agency when the complainant came there and took him to his premises for the repair of the hot plate. The incident has happened after the office hours. Therefore, in all likelihood,  the mechanic was independently engaged by the complainants and was not deputed by M/s Arjun Gas Service. Therefore, M/s Arjun Gas Service, in my opinion, cannot be held liable. Consequently, New India Assurance Co. Ltd. which had issued an insurance policy in favour of M/s Arjun Gas Service will also not be liable.
8.      As far as M/s Pranjal Indane is concerned, they claim to be an independent LPG distributor of Indian Oil Corporation. There is no evidence of they having deputed the mechanic to the premises of the complainants. Even otherwise the case of the complainants is that they had made a complaint to M/s Arjun Gas Service and not to Pranjal Indane If the complaint was made to M/s Arjun Gas Service, there could be no reason for Pranjal Indane to depute the mechanic to the premises of the complainants. Neither M/s Pranjal Indane nor M/s Arjun Gas Service claims that the complaint was lodged with M/s Arjun Gas Service and they had requested Pranjal Indane to depute a mechanic to the premises of the complainants.
9.      Through in his written version, the mechanic has claimed that he was sitting atan agency when the complainants came over and took him to his place for repair of the hot plate  he does not  claim that it was Pranjal Indane who had deputed him to go to the premises of the complainants for repair of the hot plate. It has to be kept in mind that he had visited the premises of the complainants after regular office hours. Therefore, it would be difficult to say that it was Pranjal Indane who had deputed him to the premises of the complainants. In any case, as noted earlier this is not the case of the complainants that they had lodged a complaint with Pranjal Indane,  their case being that the complaint was lodged with M/s Arjun Gas Service and this is nobody’s case that M/s Arjun Gas Service had requested Pranjal Indane to depute a mechanic for attending to the complaint of the consumer. Even if the mechanic used to sit at Pranjal Indane, the agency will not be liable unless he was their employee and was deputed by them to attend to the complaint.
10.    Though it has come in the order of the District Forum that the mechanic had produced a receipt purporting to be issued on behalf of Pranjal Indane, no such receipt before this Commission  has been filed by any of the parties in any of these matters. Therefore, I am unable to examine any such receipt. More importantly, the receipt for the charges paid in an ordinary course would be issued after he has satisfactorily finished the work and not at the time when he enters to the premises of the consumer to attend  the complaint. Admittedly the repair work never came to be finished, an accident having occurred at the time when the mechanic was repairing the hot plate. Therefore, it is difficult to accept that a receipt was issued by the mechanic to the complainant. Another important aspect in this regard is that in the entire consumer complaint, there is absolutely no reference to any such receipt. Had the receipt been issued, it would have been an important document as far as the alleged liability of Pranjal Indane is concerned and, therefore, the complainant would not have  omitted to refer to that receipt in their consumer complaints. That having not been done, it would be difficult to accept that any such receipt was actually issued by the mechanic to the complainants, on the date this incident happened. Even if any such receipt was filed by the complainants before the District Forum, that would in all likelihood  be a document procured later on in connivance with the mechanic who would have more than willing to shift his financial liability to M/s Pranjal Indane. by proclaiming that he was  acting as an employee of Pranjal Indane while repairing the hot plate. Therefore, the liability of Pranjal Indane in my opinion does not stand proved.
11.    As far as   Indian Oil Corporation and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. are concerned, the liability of the insurer is clearly established from the insurance policy issued by United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and Indian Oil Corporation. As per Section 2 of the policy, personal accident cover to third parties was payable irrespective of liability at law, the cover being Rs.1 lakh  per person per event.  In addition to the aforesaid compensation, medical expenses upto Rs.15 lakhs per event and property damage upto Rs.50,000/- were payable besides property damage relief upto Rs.25000/-. The relevance clause of the insurance policy contained in Section 2 reads as under:-
“Section II
Personal Accident cover to third parties (irrespective of liability at law)
a. P.A. 1 to 5
1,00,000/- per person per event.
b. Medical expenses
15,00,000/- per event.
c. Property damage
Relief upto Rs.25,000/-
Maximum Rs.50,000/- per event at authorized customer's registered premises
d. Per year
Rs.8 Crores.”
12.    Though the complainant must have incurred  expenditure on the treatment of late Smt. Sushilaben and on the treatment of Freya  unfortunately no evidence was produced by the complainant to prove the medical expenses incurred on the treatment of late Smt Sushilaben though they had produced the documents showing expenditure of more than Rs.40,000/- on the treatment of Freya, the complainants are entitled to the aforesaid amount from United India Insurance Co. Ltd.
","13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the revision petitions are disposed of with the following directions:-
The mechanic, namely, Farashram Joraram Bishnoi will be liable to pay compensation quantified at Rs.5 lakhs to the legal heirs of late Smt. Sushilaben and Rs. 2 lakh to the complainant Ms. Freya
United India Insurance Co. Ltd. shall be liable to pay Rs.1 lakh to the legal heirs of late Smt. Sushilaben and Rs.1 lakh to Ms. Freya besides Rs.25,000/- to the complainant as damage relief for the damage to his property on account of this incident. Thus the total liability of the United India Insurance Co. Ltd. would be Rs.2,25,000/-.
United India Insurance Co. Ltd. shall also be liable to pay a sum of Rs.40495/- towards the medical expenses incurred on the treatment of Ms. Freya.
The consumer complaint stand dismissed against M/s Arjun Gas Service, Pranjal Indane and New India Assurance Co. Ltd.
The complainants shall also be entitled to interest @ 9% p.a. on the above-referred amount w.e.f. the date of institution of the consumer complaints.
The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today.
The amount which the New India Assurance Co. Ltd. had deposited with this Commission shall be refunded to it alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount.
After making payment to the complainants in terms of this order, the balance amount if any out of the amount payable by the United India Insurance Co. Ltd. shall be refunded to the said company along with interest which may have accrued on that amount.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr.Suresh Chandra Sharma, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.      Present revision petition has been filed against the order dated 7.6.2019 in appeal No.401/2016 filed by the petitioner challenging the order of the District Forum dated 18.2.2016 in complaint no.172 of 2013 of the respondent.
2.      During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is aggrieved by the following directions of the State Commission :
“If the respondent/complainant fails to deposit balance amount alongwith interest within the period of 60 days then the appellant/respondent will return her entire deposited amount alongwith interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum with effect from the date of deposit.”
3.      It is further argued that the petitioner is also not aggrieved by the concurrent findings of the foras below that there was deficiency of service on the part of the petitioner and he is not aggrieved by the directions whereby the for a below have asked the petitioner to handover the possession of the subject flat.  It is argued that in the complaint, there was no prayer for refund of the deposited amount and no such relief was granted by the District Forum in its Order, yet the State Commission had issued above directions and thus had acted with perversity.
4.      I have heard the arguments of learned counsel and considered all the documents he has referred to, including the prayer in the complaint.  His basic argument is that the above directions of the State Commission are perverse because there was no prayer of refund in the complaint.  The following are the prayers made by the complainant in its complaint No. 172 of 2013 :
“a. The Opposite party may be directed to cancel the cancellation of allotment of said flat/apartment of the complainant.
b. The Opposite Party may be directed to take deposit of amount of the said flat/apartment of the complainant as per agreement.
c. The Opposite Party may be directed to pay to the complainant an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- for causing mental trauma due to false statement and unfair trade practice.
c-1. The Opposite Party may be directed to pay to the complainant an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- for causing harassment due to false statement and deficiency in service.
d. The litigation cost of Rs.25,000/- may be awarded in favour of the complainant.
e. Any other relief may be awarded in favour of the complainant and against the Opposite Party as this Hon’ble Forum may deem fit.”
4.      From Clause e of the prayer clause, it is apparent that the complainant/respondent had requested the forum to pass any order in his favour which the forum found fit, in the facts and circumstance of the case.  From the facts of the case, it is apparent that the petitioner had advertised a project which was unauthorized at the initial stage and for which the litigation was going on before appropriate forums.  He thereby had adopted unfair trade practice by doing so.  The matter was pending before the Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad, certain directions were issued by the Allahabad High Court in revision petition No.30044/13 titled New Estate Flat Owners Main Association –vs-  State of U.P.  which were brought to the notice of the District Forum by the complainant by filing a copy of the judgment dated 1.7.2013.  The complainant/respondent was also party in the said petition.  In that petition, the Allahabad High Court had ordered the association members to deposit the amount and directed the petitioner to accept it and also gave the timeline to the complainant to deposit the said amount within two months.  Based on these directions of the High Court of Allahabad, Fora below had set aside the cancellation of the flat of the complainant by the petitioner vide letter dated 8.12.2012.  The State Commission has given the relief in terms of prayer vide Clause e of the complaint.  While order refund is in alternate.
","5.      I have found no perversity in the present revision petition, the same is dismissed.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Ratan Lal Shaw, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.       This Revision Petition has been filed by the Petitioner under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the order passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in First Appeal No.A/73/2019 dated 27.12.2019.
2.       The case of the Complainant/Respondent No.1 is that he entered into an agreement for sale on 13.03.2010 with Opposite Parties No.1 & 2/Developers, who took up construction of a building on the land provided by Opposite Party No.3/Respondent No.6 and Petitioner/Opposite Party No.4 for purchase of a flat on the first floor of the building measuring 408 sq. ft., for a consideration of Rs.7 lakhs. Opposite Parties 1 & 2 alongwith Opposite Parties No.3 & 4 entered into a separate agreement on 25.03.1997 and the Complainant’s flat came within the developer’s allocation. Initially the Complainant paid a sum of Rs.1,70,000/- to Opposite Parties No. 1 & 2 and subsequently he paid the balance amount, totalling to Rs.6,10,000/-. Although the Complainant was ready to get the sale deed executed on payment of the final balance amount of Rs.90,000/- within the stipulated time, the Opposite Parties in collusion with each other avoided handing over of the flat. Hence, a complaint case was filed before the District Forum by the Complainant with following prayer: -
“a.      To admit the case and to direct service of notice upon the opposite parties.
b.        To direct the Opposite Parties to hand over possession of the said flat and to execute the register deed of conveyance in favour of the complainant.
c.        To direct the Opposite Parties to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for their unfair means of trade practice and mental agony and harassment caused to the complainant.
d.        To direct the Opposite Parties to pay litigation cost of Rs.50,000/-
e.        To pass such other relief or reliefs as the Ld. Forum deem fit & proper.”
3.       The District Forum allowed the Complaint on contest against Opposite Party No.1, 2 (i) to (iii) and ex-parte against Opposite Parties No.3 & 4. It directed as follows: -
“That the complaint be and the same is allowed on contest against Opposite Parties 1, 2 (i), 2 (ii) and 2 (iii) in terms of Section 13 (2) (b) (i) of the C.P. Act, 1986 and ex parte against OPs 3 & 4 in terms of Section 13 (2) (b) (ii) of the Act;
That all OPs are directed to jointly and severally hand over possession of the flat in question as per Schedule given at page 9 of the complaint, to the complainant and execute and register the same in favour of the complainant, within 45 days from the date of this order;
That the complainant is directed to pay Rs.90,000/- to the legal heirs of OP-2 i.e. OPs 2 (i), 2 (ii) and 2 (iii) on the date of registration of the flat;
That OPs 2 (i), 2 (ii) and 2 (iii) are directed to jointly and severally pay to the complainant Rs.30,000/- as compensation for physical harassment and mental agony of the complainant and Rs.10,000/- as litigation cost, to the complainant within 45 days from the date of this order;
That non-compliance by  the OPs of above orders will ensure the complainant to put the orders into execution in terms of Section 27 of the Act.”
4.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, an appeal was filed before the State Commission, which ordered as follows: -
“Regard being had to the facts of the case we simply find no merit in the Appeal. And we, therefore, dismiss the same with the observations that the Complainant/Respondent No.1 shall get the deed executed and registered in respect of the flat I n question as referred to in Schedule B of the Petition of complaint, on payment of a sum of Rs.90,000/- (rupees ninety thousand) to the substituted OPs No.2 and 3 and all the OPs are directed to execute and register the deed of conveyance in favour of the complainant and deliver possession within 45 days from the date of order. The cost of registration shall be borne by the complainant himself. Hence, we dismiss the Appeal, affirm the judgment impugned with the modifications, noted above, resulting that the complaint case being CC 237 of 2017 is allowed. Further we make it clear that if the OPs i.e. the Promoter and land owners failed to execute and register the deed of conveyance in favour of the complainant within the stipulated time, the complainant shall be at liberty to get the said deed executed through the machinery of the Forum on deposit of the balance consideration and it is obvious that cost of registration shall be borne by the complainant. Parties to bear their respective costs of Appeal.
","5.       Heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and carefully perused the record. This is a case where Respondent No.1/Complainant had booked a flat in the developer’s allocation by entering into an agreement for sale on 13.03.2010. Initial consideration amount of Rs.1,70,000/- was paid by Respondents No.1 & 2 and subsequently paid balance amount, totalling to Rs.6,10,000/-. The possession was to be given and sale deed executed in favour of the Complainant within six months from the date of agreement i.e. 13.03.2010. Respondent No.1/Complainant was willing and ready to pay the balance consideration of Rs.90,000/- and take the possession and get the sale deed executed in his favour. The Opposite Parties failed to hand over possession of the flat by deed of conveyance. Hence, a consumer complaint was filed before the District forum. The District Forum after hearing the parties directed the Opposite Parties to execute and register the sale deed in favour of the Complainant within 45 days, apart from payment of compensation and litigation expenses within the specified period. The State Commission simply found no merit in the Appeal and dismissed the same. On the concurrent findings of both the Fora below, a Revision Petition has been filed before this Commission.
6.       The jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is very limited. This Commission is not required to reassess or re-appreciate the evidences and substitute its opinion to the concurrent findings of fact by the Fora below. It was so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC 269  has held as under: -
“13.        Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal  principle  that  was  ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
7.       Same principle has been reiterated by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H & R Johnson (India) Ltd. and Ors. (2016 8 SCC 286 wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
“23. The  National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in their or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
8.       The Petitioner failed to point out any miscarriage of justice or that the findings are perverse i.e. not based on the evidences. I find no reason to interfere with the impugned order in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The revision petition has no merit and the same is dismissed in limine, with no order as to cost.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

1.      These Appeals are directed against the Order of the State Commission dated 11-10-2017 whereby a Consumer Complaint filed against M/s. Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd., Appellant in FA No.2408 of 2017, was allowed.
2.      Being aggrieved from the Order passed by the State Commission, M/s. Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. is before this Commission by way of FA No.2408 of 2017. Since the Complainant is also dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded to him, he is before this Commission by way of FA No.2407 of 2017.
3.      The case of the Complainant in nutshell is that under a Scheme of Rajasthan Government, he had got erected a shed net and he had to grow specified vegetables as per the directions of the government such as capsicum, etc., under the said shed net. The grievance of the Complainant is that the shed net erected by the Opposite Party, Jain Irrigation System Ltd., was defective and inferior material had been used in its erection. This is also his case that the GI pipes used by Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. were of inferior quality and the shed net erected by them had got torn. Though the shed net was repaired, but the vegetables grown by the Complainant got destroyed before such repair. Even thereafter, the shed net again got torn and the drip system as well as the fogger system also ran out of order. As a consequence, the tomato crop grown by the Complainant also got damaged. Alleging defects in the shed net erected by Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd., the Complainant approached the concerned State Commission seeking compensation along with reimbursement for the loss suffered by him on account of destruction of his crop.
4.      In the Consumer Complaint, the address of Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. was given as 302, Third Floor, Adarsh Plaza, Khasa Kothi Circle, Bani Park, Jaipur. The notice sent by the State Commission by registered post having not been received back, either served or unserved, for more than 30 days, the statutory presumption of service was drawn and the Company was declared to have been served. The Company having been proceeded ex parte got no opportunity to present its case before the State Commission and contest the Consumer Complaint on merits.
5.      The case of M/s. Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. is that it had shifted from the address given in the Consumer Complaint much before the notice came to be issued by the State Commission and, therefore, the notice was never received by them.
6.      Though it has been shown by the said Company that it had shifted from the address given in the Consumer Complaint, the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Complainant is that a notice sent by him to the Company at the same address after decision of the Consumer Complaint, was duly received by them and the envelope in which the notice was sent has been filed by them before this Commission. The Learned Counsel for the Company, however, submits that while shifting from the address given in the Consumer Complaint they had instructed the postal department to deliver the mail received at the old address to their new address and the postal department did not deliver the notice of the Consumer Complaint to them at the new address though the notice sent by the Learned Counsel for the Complainant was delivered at the new address of the Company.
7.      Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the considered view that the Company, namely, M/s. Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd., should be given an opportunity to contest the Consumer Complaint on merits subject to payment of adequate costs of the Complainant. The impugned Order is, therefore, set aside and the Appellant in FA No.2408 of 2017, M/s. Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. is permitted to file its Written Version to the Consumer Complaint within 30 days of receiving the paper book of the Consumer Complaint subject to payment of Rs.50,000/- as costs to the Complainant within two weeks. The parties shall appear before the State Commission on 16-04-2020. The paper book shall be supplied to the Learned Counsel for the Company within one week of receiving the costs. The Written Version can be filed within 30 days of the Company receiving the paper book of the Consumer Complaint.
8.      The amount which the Company had deposited with the State Commission shall continue to remain deposited with the said Commission and final order with respect to disbursal of the said amount with accrued interest, if any, on the said amount, shall be passed by the State Commission while deciding the Consumer Complaint.
","9.      Both the First Appeals stand disposed of.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K. AGRAWAL,PRESIDENT HON'BLE DR. S.M. KANTIKAR,MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Milan Negi, Advocate


                                                Mr. Ashu Kansal, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","For the purpose of computation of the cases filed before the National Commission, the Office is directed to register the case as First Appeal and number it accordingly.
These First Appeals, under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2019 Act”), has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. through its Resolution Professional against the Order dated 13th March, 2020, passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi at New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in Complaint Cases No. 286, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306 & 307 of 2017, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants.  The State Commission by the Impugned Order has allowed the Complaints, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants, and directed M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) to refund the entire amount received from the Complainants, including service tax alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date on which entire amount alongwith compensation is refunded, with a further direction to pay ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation to each of the Complainants.  The payment was directed to be made within three months from receipt of copy of the Order.
An Application has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) for exemption from pre-deposit of the amount, as provided under Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, which has come into force w.e.f. 20th/24th July, 2020.
The learned Counsel appearing for M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) submitted that the Appellant is not in a position to deposit the amount as contemplated under the Second Proviso to Section 51(1) of the 2019 Act. The learned Counsel further submitted that under Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act an Appeal lies to the National Commission from an Order passed in Appeal by the State Commission, where there is no requirement of pre-deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission, whereas under the Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act the Appellant is required to deposit fifty  percent of the amount in terms of the Order passed by the State Commission before the National Commission so that the National Commission may entertain the Appeal.  A harmonious construction of the various provisions of Section 51 of the 2019 Act has to be made and, if that is done, then the necessary corollary is that the deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission for entertaining the appeal is not mandatory but only directory in nature.
The learned Counsel also referred to and relied upon a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors., reported in (2014) 8 SCC 657, and submitted that it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay.
We have heard the learned Counsel for the M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) and have considered the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel.
Before adverting to the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, we deem it appropriate for ready reference to reproduce Section 51 of the 2019 Act:
“51. (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 47 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the National Commission shall not entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of  thirty days unless it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the National Commission from any order passed in appeal by any State Commission, if the National Commission is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
(3) In an appeal involving a question of law, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.
(4) Where the National Commission is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question and hear the appeal on that question:
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the National Commission to hear, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question of law.
(5) An appeal may lie to the National Commission under this section from an order passed ex parte by the State Commission.”
From a perusal of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, we find that under Sub Section (1) a right of Appeal  has been given to any person who is aggrieved by the Order passed by the State Commission in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47. Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47 deals with the powers of the State Commission to entertain Complaints only. The Appeal has to be filed within a period of thirty days of such Order. However, the First Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 gives the discretion to the National Commission to entertain the Appeal even after the period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period meaning that it has the power to condone the delay in filing the Appeal beyond thirty days. The Second Proviso to sub Section (1) of Section 51 provides  that the Appeal shall not be entertained by the National Commission of the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of the Order of the State Commission unless fifty percent of that amount has been deposited.
Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act provides a second Appeal to be preferred before the National Commission in an order passed by the State Commission in Appeal.  However, the second Appeal should involve a substantial question of law. Sub Section 3 to 5 of Section 51 are not being referred to as they are not relevant for deciding the issue involved in these cases.
In our considered opinion the intention of the Parliament while enacting 2019 Act is that if the Complaint has been decided by any one forum then the person who has been directed to pay certain amount should deposit fifty percent of that amount if a first Appeal is being filed before the next forum.  The provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 deals with the First Appeal being filed before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in the Complaint Case and, therefore, there is a requirement of deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.
We may mention here that similar provision has been made by the Parliament in Section 41 of the 2019 Act, which provides for preferring an appeal against an order passed by the District Forum before the State Commission.  For ready reference, Section 41 is reproduced below:
“41. Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Commission may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty-five days from the date of the order, in such form and manner, as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of forty-five days, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed:
Provided also that no appeal shall lie from any order passed under sub-section (1) of section 81 by the District Commission pursuant to a settlement by mediation under section 80.”
Likewise, under Section 67 of the 2019 Act, a provision has been made for filing an Appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against an order passed by the National Commission under Sub-Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 58, which deals with the orders passed in the Complaint Cases.  The Second Proviso of Section 67 also requires deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the National Commission before the Appeal can be entertained by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  For ready reference, Section 67 of the 2019 Act is reproduced below:
“67. Any person, aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 58, may prefer an appeal against such order to the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of the order:
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless that person has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.”
From a reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is absolutely clear that the Parliament wanted to make it mandatory for the Opposite Party in the Complaint Case to deposit a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded by the Consumer Fora/Commissions while preferring First Appeal.
So far as the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors. (Supra), relied upon by the learned Counsel, is concerned, we may mention here that in Paragraph-11 and 12 of the said decision, the Apex Court has held that unless the Appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the Appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission.  Paragraphs 11 and 12are reproduced below for ready reference:
“11. The second proviso to Section 19 of the Act mandates pre-deposit for consideration of an appeal before the National Commission. It requires 50% of the amount in terms of an order of the State Commission or 35,000/- whichever is less for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission. Unless the appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission. A pre-deposit condition to deposit 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission or Rs.35,000/- being condition precedent for entertaining appeal, it has no nexus with the order of stay, as such an order may or may not be passed by the National Commission. Condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals.
(Underlined by us)
12. It is not the case of any of the appellants that the Consumer Forum including State and National Commissions has no power to pass interim order of stay. If the National Commission after hearing the appeal of the parties in its discretion wants to stay the amount awarded, it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay. Entertainment of an appeal and stay of proceeding pursuant to order impugned in the appeal stands at different footings, at two different stages. One (pre-deposit) has no nexus with merit of the appeal and the other (grant of stay) depends on prima facie case; balance of convenience and irreparable loss of party seeking such stay.”
(Underlined by us)
Thus, the condition for pre-deposit of 50% awarded by the State Commission in Complaint Case in an Appeal preferred before the National Commission is mandatory. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Shreenath Corp. & Others (Supra) in paragraph 11 reproduced above condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals. This Commission cannot entertain any Appeal unless the concerned Appellant has deposited 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.  There is no provision in the 2019 Act, empowering the National Commission to waive, relax or reduce the amount to be deposited under the Second Proviso, referred to above.  The present First Appeals are, therefore, defective for want of pre-deposit of the fifty percent of the amount directed by the State Commission in the impugned Order, which has not been made by the Appellant.
","          Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.     
Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Sanjay K. Chadha, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr.  Sameer Shrivastava, Advocate
					  Mr. Arjun Singh, Advocate. 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
Late Smt. Usha Dongre wife of the complainant took as many as four insurance policies from the petitioner LIC of India submitting four different proposals one of them being dated 25.04.2014 and the remaining three being dated 18.04.2014. She having died on 21.06.2014 within about two months of submitting the proposals, claims in terms of the insurance policies taken by her were lodged by the complainant. The claims were repudiated vide letter dated 03.11.2015.which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
We have to inform you regarding your death claim with respect to the above issued policies of deceased Late Usha Dongre that the deceased during the time of taking the policy from us has concealed the material fact regarding her health and has decided to deny our all liabilities under the above policies. In this regard  we have to inform you that the deceased insured has given the following reply to the question mentioned in duly signed personal history to the proposal form dated 25.04.2014, 18.04.2014, 18.04.2014 and 18.04.2014 for insurance purpose. “
Question Answer
11-A During the last five years did you ever consult a medical practitioner for any ailment requiring treatment for more than a week?  NO
11-B  Have you ever been admitted to any hospital or Nursing Home for general check-up, observation, treatment or operation? NO
11-C   Have you ever remained absent from place of work on grounds of health during the last 5 years? NO
11-D Are you suffering from or have you ever suffered from ailments pertaining to Liver, Stomach, Stomach, Heart, Lungs Kidney, Brain or nervous system? NO

11-J What has been your usual state of health? GOOD
11-I  Have you ever required or at present availing/undergoing undergoing medical advice, treatment or test in connection with hepatitis 8 or AIDS related condition? NO
Yet we have to state that the above facts were false,because we have undisputed documents to prove that  prior to the submission of the proposal form for the abovepolicies, on 25/02/2014 deceased Insured received head injury, therefore on 28.02.2014 the deceased got admitted in Dr. Panna Lal Bapna and on 01.03.2014 discharged from the hospital. Deceased due to Head injury do irrelevant Talk and due to misbehaviour duringthe proposal stage was under suspension. But the deceased has not mentioned the said facts in her life proposal form / personal history. In its place given the false reply which is mentioned above.
Therefore, it is proved that she during taking the policies intentionally given the false statement regarding her health and concealed the true facts and therefore as per the terms & conditions of the policy and the declaration made in the insurance proposal form we reject the insurance claim and accordingly under the above policies not liable and bound for making payment and consequently all the amount which has been paid, not payable to you. Yet as per new provision of Section-45 the premium paid would be refunded as per rules, kindly in this regard contact our Branch Office, Rajnand Gaon.
2.      Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.
3.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner Corporation primarily on the grounds on which  the claim had been repudiated.
","4.      The District Forum having dismissed the consumer complaints, the complainant/R-1 approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. Vide impugned orders dated 26.12.2027 the State Commission allowed the appeals and directed the petitioner Corporation to pay the sum assured to the complainant along with interest and compensation. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission the petitioner corporation is before this Commission.
5.      The proposals as noted earlier were submitted by the deceased insured in April 2014. A perusal of the proposals would show that while answering the questions contained in the proposal, she clearly stated that in  the last 5 years she had not taken treatment for any ailment for a period of more than one week. She also stated that she had not been admitted in any hospital for any kind of treatment investigation etc. She maintained that she had never suffered nor was she suffering from any ailment relating inter alia to brain. She also stated that she had never met with an accident and had not suffered injury.
6.      The petitioner Corporation has placed on record the prescription purporting to be issued by Bafna Hospital Dangargarh to Smt. Usha Dongre which shows that she had fallen at her house and had head injuries as a result of which she was talking irrelevant. The petitioner Corporation has also placed on record a certificate of the treatment of Smt. Usha Dongre at Bafna Hospital Dangargarh purporting to be signed and stamped by Dr. Pannalal Bafna of the said Hospital. In the above-referred certificate it is stated that Smt. Usha Dongre was admitted in the hospital on 28.02.2014 and early she had been treated by a doctor. It was also stated in the said certificate that she was talking irrelevant things on account of the head injury suffered by her and the duration of the complaint as reported by her was one month.
7.      It is evident from the certificate issued by Bafna hospital and the prescription issued by Pannalal Bafna of the said hospital that Smt. Usha Dongre sustained injuries on head when she had an accidental fall at her residence and treatment for the injury so suffered by her had lasted one month. Therefore, going by the above-referred certificate and prescription issued by Bafna hospital she had made false statements in the proposal submitted by her when she stated that she had not consulted a medical practitioner for any ailment requiring treatment for more than a week. She also gave wrong answers to the question which required her to disclose any accident and injury suffered by her.
8.      The submission of the counsel for the complainant/R-1 is that the above-referred record of Bafna hospital was not proved by the petitioner Corporation and since no doctor from the said hospital was examined nor was the affidavit of anyone from the said hospital filed to prove the aforesaid record. As noted earlier, the repudiation letters issued by the petitioner Corporation on 03.11.2015 clearly and very specifically referred to the treatment of Smt. Usha Dongre in Bafna Hospital. It was specifically stated that she was admitted in the hospital by Dr. Pannalal Bafna on 28.02.2014. It was also stated therein that she had suffered head injuries prior to 25.02.2014. The complainant/R-1, however, did not even allege in the consumer complaint filed before the District Forum that late Smt. Usha Dangal had not suffered an accidental injury at her home. It was not even claimed in the consumer complaint that Smt. Usha Dongri was not admitted in Bafna Hospital and had not been treated by Pannalal Bafna. In my opinion, since the accidental injury, alleged to have been suffered by Smt. Usha Dongre and her admission and treatment in Bafna hospital was the sole ground of  repudiation of the claims it was imperative for the complainant to at least plead in the consumer  complaints that the deceased had not suffered head injury as was claimed in the repudiation letter and had not been admitted and treated in Bafna Hospital.
9.      The petitioner Corporation filed written version specifically taking the ground on which the claim had been repudiated.  The head injury suffered by deceased and treatment taken by her at Bafna Hospital was specifically referred in the written version filed by the Corporation. No rejoinder to the written version was filed. The complainant had filed an affidavit by way of evidence before the concerned District Forum. Even in the affidavit filed by the complainant it was nowhere claimed that late Smt. Usha Dongre had not suffered a head injury and had not been admitted and treated in Bafna Hospital. In these circumstances the petitioner Corporation, in my opinion, was not required to examine a doctor from Bafna Hospital or to file his affidavit to prove the record pertaining to the admission and treatment of Smt. Usha dogre in the said Hospital.
10.    The question involved in these revision petitions recently came up for consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 9.   In LIC of India Vs. Manish Gupta – Civil Apeal No.3944 of 2019, decided on 15.04.2019, the proposal form required a disclosure as to whether the proposer had suffered from Cardiovascular disease, he responded in negative to the said question. The complainant underwent a surgery, submitted a claim        which was repudiated on the ground that he was suffering from a pre-existing illness. Upholding the repudiation of the claim, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia held as under:-
“A contract of insurance involves utmost good faith. In Satwant Kaur Sandhu Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd., this Court has held thus:
“...Thus, it needs little emphasis that when an information on a specific aspect is asked for in the proposal form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within his knowledge. It is not for the proposer to determine whether the information sought for is material for the purpose of the policy or not. Of course, obligation to disclose extends only to facts which are known to the applicant and not to what he ought to have known. The obligation to disclose necessarily depends upon the knowledge one possesses. His opinion of the materiality of that knowledge is of no moment.”
……….The documentary material indicates that there was a clear failure on the part of the respondent to disclose that he had suffered from rheumatic heart disease since childhood. The ground for repudiation was in terms of the exclusions contained in the policy. The failure of the insured to disclose the past history of cardiovascular disease was a valid ground for repudiation.”
In Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod – Civil Appeal No.4261 of 2019, decided on 24.4.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia observed as under:-
“26.    …………..It is standard practice for the insurer to set out in the application a series of specific questions regarding the applicant's health history and other matters relevant to insurability. The object of the proposal form is to gather information about a potential client, allowing the insurer to get all information which is material to the insurer to know in order to assess the risk and fix the premium for each potential client. Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries. This allows the parties to serve their interests better and understand the true extent of the contractual agreement.
The finding of a material misrepresentation or concealment in insurance has a significant effect upon both the insured and the insurer in the event of a dispute. The fact it would influence the decision of a prudent insurer in deciding as to whether or not to accept a risk is a material fact. As this Court held in Satwant Kaur (supra) “there is a clear presumption that any information sought for in the proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurane”. Each representation or statement may be material to the risk. The insurance company may still offer insurance protection on altered terms.
29.     We are not impressed with the submission that the proposer was unaware of the contents of the form that he was required to fill up or that in assigning such a response to
a third party, he was absolved of the consequence of appending his signatures to the proposal. The proposer duly appended his signature to the proposal form and the grant of the insurance cover was on the basis of the statements contained in the proposal form.  …………..”
11.    The learned counsel for the complainant submits that late Smt. Usha Dongre was duly examined by the panel doctor of LIC of India and the policy was issued to her only after she was examined and found fit by the said doctor. In my opinion the examination by the doctor on the panel of the petitioner Corporation would be of no help, since a contract of insurance being based on utmost good faith it was absolutely essential for the deceased to declare the true state of affairs and give a truthful answer to all the questions contained in the proposals submitted by her.
12.    The learned counsel for the complainant relied upon the decision of this commission in Ravinder Singh. In my opinion, no reliance on the aforesaid decision can be placed in view of the authoritative pronouncement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted hereinabove.
13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order cannot be sustained at the same is hereby set aside. The revision   petitions are allowed and consumer complaints are hereby dismissed with no order as  to cost.

                                          Advocate 
  For the Opp.Party      :
","This consumer complaint has been filed by the complainant Arjun Vishnu Kirpalani against the opposite parties HDFC Securities Ltd. & ors.
2.      Heard the learned counsel for the complainant at the admission stage. Learned counsel stated that the complaint has been filed by the complainant for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party bank.  The opposite party bank has been deficient in providing proper service in connection with purchase of Mutual Funds, providing service of granting of loan to the complainant and in many other services. It has been alleged that even though the loan was sanctioned no documents have been provided by the opposite party bank.  It was further alleged that the complainant has put in Rs.16,28,08,454/- in the bank.  However, the bank has traded without any knowledge to the complainant about the sale and purchase of different shares as well as of the Mutual Funds.  Learned counsel stated that the complainant started transacting through the opposite party bank from the year 2016 and has suffered great loss due to deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party bank.
3.       I have given a thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the complainant and have examined the record.  It is seen from the complaint that the complainant in para 22 of the complaint has given the details of Rs.16,28,08,454/- as follows:-
“(i)  Approximate loss suffered by the complainant towards Share Market mostly in call and put options trading and Business:- 11,47, 14,278/- (Rupees Eleven Crores Forty Seven Lacs Fourteen Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy Eight only).
(ii)  Approximate loss suffered by the complainant on account of brokerage/commissions and taxes and other ancillary charges:-4,75,94,176/- (Rupees four Crores Seventy Five Lacs Ninety Four Thousand One Hundred and Seventy Six only).
(iii) The complainant used to travel Europe regularly and due to heavy international call charges, he lost approximately 5 lacs towards cell phone charges over four years due to lengthy long distance calls during trading hours.
(iv) Total Loss suffered by the complainant: Rs.16,28,08,454/- (Rupees sixteen crores twenty eight lacs eight thousand four hundred and fifty four only).”
4.      Similarly about the loans, the following has been averred in the complaint:-
“Thus the duty of the bank to provide good service and to redeem reward points properly and respond appropriately was totally missing in HDFC Bank and HDFC Credit Card Services.  The said EMIs are being paid through the bank account of the complainant.  The details of the said loans are as under:-

It is stated that the above loan facilities figuring at Sr.No.1 & 2 were given to the complainant by the opposite party No.1 HDFC Bank Ltd., however, the loan documents were never supplied to the complainant.  The complainant is not aware as to from which financial services companies/entities the other loan facilities were given, for want of loan and other related documents.”
5.      Coming to the question of investment in mutual fund, it is seen that the statutory warning also accompanies with any advertisement or any brochure relating to mutual fund investment that investments in mutual fund are subject to market risks.
","6.      The investments in mutual fund are basically aimed at earning profit and the transactions will be treated as of commercial nature as the same are not for earning livelihood by means of self-employment in the present case because the amounts of investments are quite high and the complainant who is a Canadian citizen, is earning in Canada and investing in India.  Thus, the issue of earning livelihood by means of self-employment is not material in the present case.  Mutual funds are subject to market risks so, if an investor incurs loss, the broker cannot be blamed. It is further seen that no allegation has been made by the complainant on the bank that bank has misappropriated funds of the complainant from the d-mat account or any other account, therefore, the deficiency on the part of the bank is not proved.  Thus, the complaint in respect of investments in mutual funds is dismissed in limine.
7.      One of these loans No.4624921 has already been closed, however, another loan No.5613403 is active as this is a commercial loan.  This Commission cannot entertain the issue regarding this loan as the loan has not been taken for earning of livelihood by means of self-employment.
8.      Other loans relate to purchases of cars (old and new) and the complainant has not given the date of sanction of these loans.  It is mentioned at one place that the loan relating to auto premium loan for Rs.1,28,75,000/- is sanctioned on 27.10.2016. The date of sanction in respect of other loans are not given in the complaint, therefore, the same may be assumed being some date in the year 2016 or at the most 2017.  If the bank did not give the details of the loan account, the complainant should have filed the consumer complaint at that time. Moreover, it is also not clear, if the complainant was not satisfied by opening one loan account, why did he prefer this bank for obtaining other loans in the same sector.  Thus, the claim filed in respect of not receiving the details of the loan account seems to be beyond limitation period of two years and therefore, the same cannot be entertained by this Commission. However, this being the genuine claim of the complainant as each loan holder is supposed to get the loan agreement and other details from the bank, I direct the HDFC Bank to provide the details of the loan accounts to the complainant within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.  In the present case, no notice is being issued to the HDFC as this is a very trivial issue and the bank is obliged to provide the details of the loan account to the loanee.  However, if the bank is not satisfied with this order, they will be at liberty to approach this Commission.
9.      Consumer Complaint No.1303 of 2019 is accordingly disposed of.

In the Complaint, it is stated that the Complainant,allured by the ready-to-move-in apartments being offered with world class amenities by the Opposite Party within a period of 39 months of allotment (inclusive of the additional grace period of 90 days, as per clause 7.1 of the Standard Terms and Conditions of the Opposite Party), sought to purchase an apartment, for his personal residence. Accordingly, Complainant booked K-8/1003, two-bedroom unit with a covered area of approximately 1600 sq. ft., vide cheque bearing number 123865 dated 20.11.2010 forRs. 8,17,975/- . On 31.03.2011, the Complainant received provisional allotment pursuant to the aforesaid booking. Thereafter, the Opposite Party sent a demand notice dated 31.03.2011 for Rs. 16,14745/- and directed the Complainant to pay the amount before the due date of 30.04.2011, failing which he would be liable to pay interest @18% p.a. for the period of delay. The Complainant duly paid the said amount, vide cheque dated 22.04.2011. On 28.04.2011, the Opposite Party issued a fresh demand notice for Rs. 7,69,107/- . The same was also paid by the Complainant, vide cheque dated 17.05.2011. Pursuant to an incentive scheme dated 05.08.2011 announced by the Opposite Party, the Complainant, vide intimation dated 10.06.2011, applied for change of his payment plan from construction linked to down payment. Accordingly, the Opposite Party revised the payment plan to Rs. 75,00,280/-. As per revised payment plan, it was admitted by the Opposite Party that Rs. 29,99,200/- (excluding service tax) had already been paid by the Complainant towards basic price and Rs. 1,22,250/- towards IDC. Through demand notice dated 30.06.2011, Rs. 36,29,852/- (inclusive service tax) was demanded by the Opposite Party by 20.07.2011.The Complainant paid the aforesaid amount, vide cheques dated 18.07.2011 & 19.07.2011.It is relevant to mention here that the Opposite Party had also demanded Rs. 4,00,000/- for the car parking slot, contrary to well established law of this Commission and the Apex Court that first parking shall be free. Rs. 3,74,900/- was balance towards the basic price and the Complainantby 19.07.2011 had paid more than 95% of the due consideration.Despite making all the payments well before the due date,the Complainant was shockedto receive a notice dated 11.05.2012 that Rs. 58,42,205/- was outstanding against him and the Opposite Party demanded the same with interest @12% p.a. in 30 days, failing which they threatened to cancel the allotment. The Complainant promptly sent a reply vide an email dt. 11.05.2012 and also delivered a copy thereof at the office of the Opposite Party on 16.05.2012. However, the Opposite Party took six long months to admit payment of all dues without conceeding their fault, vide letter dated 23.11.2012. It was alleged that the possession of the unit K-8/1003 was not delivered within the promised 36 months plus a grace period of 3 months. The said period for handing over the possession expired on 30.06.2014. However, the Complainant was shocked and aggrieved to receive a letter dated 06.09.2014 wherein it was stated that the unit would be ready for possession in April 2016. No specific cause(s) of delay were given, except a bald statement that the delay was due to “various reasons beyond control”. No other communication explaining the cause of continuing delay was ever received by the Complainant till the date of filing of the present Complaint in November 2016.A notice dated 22.10.2016 was sent to the Opposite Party for refund of the deposit with interest, vide speed post and email. It was submitted that the unit is still incomplete as on August, 2019.
Alleging deficiency on the part of Opposite Party, Complainantfiled a Complaint before this Commission under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, praying relief as under:-
Direct the Opposite Party to refund the amount deposited by the Complainant, i.e. Rs. 68,31,679/- along with interest @18% per annum from the date of deposit till the date of paymentas compensation for deficiency in services on account of delay.
In the alternative,
Direct the Opposite Party to handover possession of the apartment to the Complainant, complete in all respects, in conformity with the Provisional Allotment Letter without the cost of car parking, additional super area along with interest @18% per annum beyond the period of 39 months i.e. from June, 2014 till the date of possession.
Direct the Opposite Party to provide adequate car parking space in the project for the Complainant and desist from collecting any amount for the same.
Direct the Opposite Party to pay the Complainant adequate compensation for causing him mental agony and physical harassment resulting from a waste of his time in making umpteen visits to their office quantified at Rs. 5 lakhs and in addition to the above the Opposite Partyshould be saddled with punitive damages quantified at Rs. 5 lakhs for threatening to cancel his allotment even when he had paid 90-95% of the cost of the apartment which was rectified only after 6 months without any apology.
Direct the Opposite Party to bear the increase in service tax with effect from 01.06.2015.
Direct the Opposite Party to pay a sum of Rs.2 lakhs to the Complainant towards cost of litigation.
Pass such other and further orders which this Hon’ble Commission may think fit and proper, in the facts and circumstances of the case in favour of the Complainant and against the Opposite Party.
3. The Opposite Party resisted the Complaint by filing Written Statement. The Opposite Party issued a provisional allotment  letter dated 31.03.2011 allotting an apartment bearing unit Reference No. K 8-1003 in “Kalypso Court” project of the Opposite Party admeasuring a Super Area of 1630 sq. ft. (151.43 sq. mtrs.) in favour of the Complainant herein. The said Provisional Allotment letter provided the total consideration of the said unit as Rs. 80,85,450/-, excluding other charges and a payment plan was  also provided therein. Further, as per the request made by the Complainant by e-mail dated 10.06.2011 regarding the amendment of Provisional Allotment letter, the Opposite Party vide letter dated 30.06.2011, revised the consideration of the unit to Rs. 75,00,280/- excluding other charges. The time period for possession was provided as 36 months in the said Provisional Allotment Letter, subject to a grace period of 90 days given in the standard terms and conditions as agreed by the Complainant.
The Complainant booked the apartment in the project for speculating in the Real Estate Market, as there is no mention in the Complaint that he  booked this unit for his personal use. The Complainant is not a consumer as defined in Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the present complaint is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.
The value of the flat booked by the Complainant was less than Rs. 1 Crore, as such this Commission did not have pecuniary jurisdiction to try this matter. Admittedly, the total value of the flat was Rs. 75,00,280/- only. Thus, the present matter did not fall within the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Commission. The Complainant had deliberately sought untenable prayers of interest to raise the claim to bring the Complaint within the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Commission. Instead, the present Complaint ought to have been filed by the Complainant before the State Commission. Thus, the Complaint be rejected on this ground alone.
","The present Complaint suffers with from the defect of Non-joinder of necessary and proper parties, as the present Complaint is filed against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. only, though the Provisional Allotment Letter, is signed, executed and issued by the Jaiprakash Associate Ltd. and Jaypee Infratech Ltd.. Hence the present Complaint is liable to be dismissed on this ground also.
It was submitted that there is an arbitration clause No. 10.8 for amicable settlement in the agreed Standard Terms and Conditions of the Application form dated 20.11.2010 duly signed by the Complainant which provided as under:
“Dispute Resolution: any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with or in relation hereto shall so far as possible, in the first instance; be amicably settled between the company and the Applicant. In the event of disputes, claim and/or differences not amicably resolved such disputes shall be referred to sole arbitration of a person nominated for the purpose by Chairman of the Company. The proceedings of the Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and conciliation Act 1996, as amended from time to time, or any rules made there under. The Applicant hereby gives his consent to the appointment of the sole arbitrator as specified herein above and waives any objections that he may have to such appointment or to the award that may be given by the Arbitrator. The venue for the arbitration shall be New Delhi, India”. It is clarified that the applicants/complainant has to approach to amicably settle the instant issue, between the parties as provided in agreed standard terms and conditions. Therefore, the Complainant must invoke the arbitration clause after trying to amicably settle the dispute at the first instances. The Opposite Party also filed an Application under section 8, “Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996”, however the present reply has been filed to comply with the limitation provided, without prejudice to the application u/s 8, filed along with the present reply.
After issuing the Provisional Allotment Letter dated 31.03.2011, the Opposite Party carried out the development work on the said project. However for reasons beyond the control of the Opposite party i.e. due to force majeure events, such as –shortage of labour, scarcity of water, restrictions in excavations, villager agitations as well as legal impediments which continued to exist some time. The progress of the project got slow down. These facts were duly brought to the notice of Complainant, vide letter dated 06.09.2014. Due to such events the delivery of project got rescheduled. At the time of booking of subject matter apartment, it was agreed between the parties (clause 7.1 of the Standard Terms and Conditions) that in case of force majeure events, the Opposite Party would be entitled to extension of time without incurring any liability.
Clause 7.1 and 7.2 of the Standard Terms and Conditions as agreed by the prospective buyers/customers/complainant provided that:
“7.1 The Company shall make best efforts to deliver possession of the said Premises to the Applicant within the period more specifically described in the Provisional Allotment Letter with a further grace period of 90 days. If the completion of the Said Premises is delayed by reason of non-availability or scarcity of steel and/or cement and/or other building materials and/or water supply and/or  electric power and/or slow down, strike and/or due to dispute with the construction agency employed by the Company, lock-out or civic commotion or any militant  action or by reason of war, or enemy action, or earthquake or any act of God or if non-delivery of possession is as a result of any Law or as a result of any restrictions imposed by a Governmental Authority or delay in the sanction of  building/zoning plans/grant of completion/occupation certificates by any Governmental Authority or for any other reason beyond the control of the Company (hereinafter referred to as “Force Majeure Event”) the Company shall be entitled to a reasonable  extension of time  for delivery of possession of the said premises.”
“7.2 Nothing contained herein shall be construed to give raise to any right to a claim by way of compensation/damages loss of profit or consequential losses against the Company on account of delay in handing over possession for any of the aforesaid conditions beyond the control of the Company. If, however, the Company fails to deliver possession of the said Premises within the stipulated period as mentioned herein above, and within the further grace period of 90 days thereafter, the Applicant shall be entitled to compensation for delay thereafter @Rs.5/- per sq. ft. (Rs. 54/- per sq. mtr.) per month for the Super area of the Said Premises (‘Rebate”). The time consumed by the occurrence of Force Majeure Events shall be excluded while computing the time delay for the delivery of possession of the Said Premises”.
4. Heard the Learned Counsel for the Complainant. Also carefully perused the record.
5. The Opposite Party contested that the Complainant had booked the Apartment in the project for speculating in the Real Estate Market and hence is not a Consumer as defined under the Act.
The Complainant has clearly stated in his Complaint that he was “tempted to own an apartment for his personal residence”.  The Complainant has also stated in his written arguments that he purchased the said Apartment “for self after marriage as his residence”. No evidence has been adduced by the Opposite Party that the Complainant has generated any profit by way of trading, except the bald allegation that he brought the apartment for speculation in the Real Estate Market. The Complainant is a consumer as he sought to purchase the apartment for his personal use.
The Opposite Party further contended that as the value of booked flat was less than Rs. 1 Crore, this Commission did not have any pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain this matter. The Complainant had booked the Flat in the year 2010. The Opposite Party had itself admitted in the written statement that the total value of the flat was Rs. 75,00,280/-. The Complainant paid Rs. 68,31,679/- till the date of filing the Complaint.  Approximately 10 years has already elapsed, but till date possession of the Flat has not been delivered. In Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., this Commission held that interest has to taken into account in computing pecuniary jurisdiction. After adding interest on the value of the Flat, the present Complaint would lie within the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Commission.
Another point of contention is that the present Complaint suffers with the defect of Non-joinder of necessary and proper parties, as it was filed against Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. only, though the Provisional Allotment Letter is signed, executed and issued by Jaiprakash Associate Ltd. and Jaypee Infratech Ltd.  As per the payment plan and receipts placed on record, it is found that all payments were made in the account of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. only. The issue of non-joinder of parties came up before this Commission in Anish Singhal vs. Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. CC/2194/2016 decided on 01.10.2019 wherein it was held that the complaint against Jaiprakash Associates was maintainable.
The contention that as per Standard Terms and Conditions, the Complainant must invoke the arbitration clause in the first instance, Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act provides that the Act is in addition to and in derogation of the provisions of any other law being in force. The Consumer Protection Act is a socially beneficial legislation which is in addition to the rights of a Consumer. The Complainant can, therefore, come to this Commission as an alternative remedy. This issue  also came up for consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in National Seeds Corporation Vs. M. Madhusudhan Reddy & Anr. (2012)2SCC 506 whereby it was held that the Complaint filed by a s Consumer before the Consumer Fora would be maintainable, despite there being an arbitration clause in the agreement to refer the dispute to the Arbitrator.
The Opposite Party also contended that at the time of booking of the apartment, it was agreed between the parties that in case of force majeure events, the Opposite Party would be entitled to extension of time without incurring any liability. Possession of the flat has not yet been delivered to the Complainant. The Opposite Party has not provided any evidence in support of the reasons adduced by the Opposite Party. There being no evidence as to unforeseen and unexpected events which prevented the development of the allotted unit, the Opposite Party cannot take shelter of the force majeure clause. A person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for the possession of the flats allotted to him/her. The reasons stated for force majeure conditions are only delay tactics to handover possession of the Apartment. The Complainant is, therefore, entitled to seek the refund of the amount paid by him along with compensation.
6.  In view of the above, the Opposite Party is directed to refund the amount deposited/paid by the Complainant with simple interest of 10% per annum with effect from the respective date of each payment, till the date of refund with compensation. Further, the Opposite Party is directed to pay Rs. 25,000/- towards cost of litigation. Payments in terms of this order shall be made within three month from today.

The said vehicle having met with an accident near Mallee village of District Pauri Garhwal in Uttrakhand, the said vehicle got badly damaged.  A claim for reimbursement in terms of the insurance policy was lodged by the complainant/petitioner with the respondent company.

Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.
2.       The consumer complaint was resisted by the insurance company on the ground on which the claim was repudiated.
3.       The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint the insurer approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated  12.02.2008 the State Commission allowed the appeal and consequently dismissed the consumer complaint.
4.       Being aggrieved the petitioner is before Commission by way of this Revision Petition.
5.       It is not in dispute that the accident took place on a road in a hilly area.  It is also not in dispute that the vehicle was a light motor vehicle and at the time of accident it was carrying 9 passengers besides newspapers.  The driving licence of the driver authorised him to drive light motor vehicle(commercial) throughout the territory of India.  However, in the State of Uttrakhand there was a requirement of obtaining a special endorsement for driving in a hilly area, the said requirement having been incorporated in rule 193 of Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicle Rules, 1993 which were applicable in the state of Uttrakhand as well.
5.      Rule 193 of the Uttar Pradesh Motor Vehicle Rules, 1998 which are applicable in the State of Uttarakhand read as under:
“193. Endorsement of certain licenses for hill roads – No person shall drive a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle on a hill road unless his license to drive such public service vehicle or goods vehicle has been endorsed by a Registering Authority with a permission to drive upon hill roads situated within the jurisdiction of such Registering Authority or in the case of a public service vehicle hired by tourists, by the Registering Authority of the State with which reciprocal arrangement on the point have been agreed upon.”
6.       This issue came up for consideration of this Commission in RP No. 3057 of 2017 in St. Xaviers School Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. decided on 12.12.2018 and the following view was taken:-
6.        In view of the above-referred Rule, the vehicle in question could not have been driven on a hill road without requisite endorsement from the Registering Authority of Uttarakhand or by the Registering Authority of the State with which reciprocal arrangement on this point had been agreed upon.  It is not in disputed that on the date of the accident, the driver did not have a requisite endorsement to drive the vehicle on  a hill road on his driving licence. Therefore, it cannot be said that he was holding a valid driving licence at the time the vehicle met with an accident.
7.      The learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance upon three decisions of Uttarakhand High Court in support of his contention. The decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner are the orders 22.8.2017 passed in Appeal from Order No.436 of 2010 – National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Nidhi Gosain & Ors., Order dated 5.6.2018 in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Rikeshwar Prasad & Ors. and Order dated 22.9.2017 in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Devki Devi & Ors. in Appeal from Order No.29 of 2012.  However, it is not in dispute that all these matters pertained to third party claims and none of them pertained to a case where the insured himself is seeking compensation on account of damage to the vehicle.
8.      The learned counsel for the petitioner also places relies upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaran Singh (2004 AIR SCW 663). However, a perusal of the said judgment would show that it was also a case of third party claimants.
9.      This issue came for consideration in Revision Petition No.520 of 2018 in Suresh Kumar Vs. Iffco Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd. and the following view was taken after considering the several decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court  including Swaran Singh (supra) on which reliance is placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner:-
“6.      In National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Laxmi Narain Dhut (2007) 3 SCC 700, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted as under:
“24.   In the background of the statutory provisions, one thing is crystal clear i.e. the statute is beneficial one qua the third party.  But that benefit cannot be extended to the owner of the offending vehicle.  The logic of fake licence has to be considered differently in respect of the third party and in respect of own damage claims.
36.    The inevitable conclusion therefore is that the decision in Swaran Singh case has no application to own damage cases.  The effect of fake licence has to be considered in the light of what has been stated by this Court in New India Assurance Co. V. Kamla.  Once the licence is a fake one the renewal cannot take away the effect of fake licence.  It was observed in Kamla case as follows: (SCC p. 347, para 12)
38.    In view of the above analysis the following situations emerge:
1.     The decision in Swaran Singh case has no application to cases other than third-party risks.
2.     XXXXXXX
3.     In case of third-party risks the insurer has to indemnify the amount, and if so advised, to recover the same from the insured.
4.     The concept of purposive interpretation has no application to cases relatable to Section 149 of the Act.
In National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Om Prakash Jain Civil Appeal No. 6248 of 2009 decided on 14.09.2009, the Hon’ble Supreme Court referring to its earlier decision in Laxmi Narain Dhut (supra) and Swaran Singh (supra) specifically held as under:
“In National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Laxmi Narain Dhut [2007 (3) S.C.C. 700], it has been clearly laid down that the decision in the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Swaran Singh & Anr. [2004 (3) S.C.C. 297] has no application to the cases other than third-party risks and where originally licence was a fake, renewal thereof cannot validate the same.  In the present case, the complaint was filed for damage of the vehicle of the insured and not the third party risk.  The District Forum and State Commission have concurrently held that the original licence of the driver was fake.  This being the position, the District Forum was justified in dismissing the complaint and the State Commission committed an error by awarding compensation to the respondent”.
In the aforesaid case, the complaint was filed by the insured himself seeking compensation for the damage caused to his vehicle, which had met with an accident.  It was found that the driving licence possessed by the driver of the vehicle was a fake licence.  The National Commission having decided in favour of the complainant, the matter was taken by the insurance company to the Apex Court.
In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Davinder Singh (2007) 8 SCC 698, the respondent owned a vehicle which he had got insured from the appellant United India Insurance Co. Ltd.  The said vehicle met an accident with a truck.  It was being driven by a person, who did not possess a valid licence.  The owner of the vehicle filed a complaint before the District Forum, seeking compensation for the damages caused to his vehicle.  This Commission have ruled in his favour.  The matter was taken to the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of an appeal.  Allowing the appeal filed by the insurance company, the Apex Court inter-alia held that the fora below had committed an error in holding the insurance company liable to indemnify the owner of the vehicle with regard to the losses sustained by him.  During the course of the judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, inter-alia observed as under:
“10.  It is, thus, axiomatic that whereas an insurance company may be held to be liable to indemnify the owner for the purpose of meeting the object and purport f the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, the same may not be necessary in a case where an insurance company may refuse to compensate the owner of the vehicle towards his own loss.  A distinction must be borne in mind as regards the statutory liability of the insurer vis-à-vis the purport and object sought to be achieved by a beneficent legislation before a forum constituted under the Motor Vehicles Act and enforcement of a contract qua contract before a Consumer Forum”.
In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. V. Meena Variyal (2007) 5 SCC 428, the Hon’ble Supreme Court referring to its earlier decision in Swaran Singh, 2004(3) SCC 297 held as under:
“It is difficult to apply the ratio of this decision to a case not involving a third party.  The whole protection provided by Chapter XI of the Act is against third-party risk.  Therefore, in a case where a person is not a third party within the meaning of the Act, the insurance company cannot be made automatically liable merely by resorting to Swaran Singh ratio.  This appears to be the position.  This position was expounded recently by this Court in Naitonal Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Laxmi Narain Dhut.  This Court after referring to Swaran Singh and discussing the law summed up the position thus : (Laxmi Narain Dhut case, SCC p. 719 para 38)
The legal proposition emerges from the above referred decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court is that though the insurance company is liable to a third-party even if the vehicle, at the time it meets with an accident is being driven by a person who does not possess a valid driving licence, the position would be different in a case where compensation is sought by the insured himself, for the damage caused to his vehicle.  Wherever, the insured himself is the claimant, the insurance company is not liable to reimburse him for the damage caused to the vehicle, if it is found that the driver of the vehicle did not possess a valid licence at the time the vehicle met with an accident.”
7.      In “National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Jarnail Singh & Ors.” [JT 2001 (Supp. 2) SC 218], the driving licence of the driver, who drove the vehicle had expired on 16.05.94.  The vehicle met with an accident on 20.10.94 and the driving licence was renewed only with effect from 28.10.96.  It was held that the proviso of subsection (1) of section 15 became applicable to the case and since the driver had no effective licence to drive the vehicle on the date of the accident, the policy condition was violated and the insurance company was not liable to pay any amount to the insured.  The aforesaid decision was quoted and applied by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Suresh Chandra Aggarwal” [AIR 2009 SC 2987].  In Suresh Chandra Aggarwal (supra), the driver of the vehicle was not holding an effective licence at the time it met with an accident since the said licence had already expired on 25.10.91, whereas the accident took place on 29.02.92.  The policy condition applicable in that case required that the person entitled to drive the vehicle should hold or should have held a driving licence and should not be disqualified from holding an effective driving licence.  It was noted that though the driving licence had expired on 25.10.91, 4 months prior to the accident it was got renewed only with effect from 23.03.1992 and the driver had not applied for the renewal of the licence within 30 days of its expiry.  Referring to the proviso of section 15 sub-section (1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, it was held that in such a case, the licence could be renewed only from the date of its renewal and in the interregnum period between expiry of the licence and the date of its renewal, there was no effective licence in existence.  The decision of this Commission holding the Insurance Company liable was, therefore, set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.”
","10.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I hold that as far as the claim filed by the insured himself is concerned, the same would not be payable where the driver of the vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time the vehicle meets within an accident. Since admittedly the driver did not have a valid driving licence authorising him to drive on a hill road at the time the accident took place, the complainant/insured is not entitled to any reimbursement from the insurer.   The view taken by the State Commission therefore does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  The revision petition being is, therefore,  dismissed.”
7.       For the reasons stated hereinabove the view taken by the State Commission does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  The revision petition is, therefore, dismissed.  The fees of the amicus curiae be paid.

Aggrieved by the orders dated 27.07.2016 in Appeal No. 265 & 266 of 2014 passed by Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short “the State Commission”) Opposite Parties (hereinafter referred to as “the Postal Department”) has preferred these Revision Petitions  under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”).
2.       By the impugned order, the State Commission has dismissed both the  Appeals preferred by the Postal Department and upheld the Orders of the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Jaipur Fourth (for short “the District Forum”). In CC No. 1045/2012, the District Forum allowed the Complaint and directed the Postal Department to pay in Indian currency the equivalent value of $10,350 as on the date of order along with interest @ 9% p.a.  with ₹3,500/- towards damages and ₹2,500/- towards costs. IN CC No. 816/2012 the Postal Department was directed to pay in Indian currency the equivalent value of $5478.72 as on the date of order along with interest @ 9% p.a.,  with ₹3,500/- towards damages and ₹2,500/- towards costs.
RP No. 3117/2016
3.       Briefly stated, the facts of the case in RP No. 3117 of 2016 are that the Complainant is a Dealer and Exporter of Gem Stones and having received an order of $10,350 from his customer/client namely Sh. Virender Kumar r/o 104-33, 92, Avenue Reckmond Hill, New York – 11418, USA, the Complainant sent the consignment through Postal Department vide invoice No. NGL-14/13.7.2002 through speed post No. EE-830077169 dated 17.07.2002.  It is averred that his client did not receive the said parcel. The Complainant visited the Postal Department a number of times to know the whereabouts of the said consignment.  The Postal Department informed him that the consignment had been delivered.  However, his client repeatedly informed the Complainant that he had not received the said consignment.  It was only on 18.10.2002 that he was informed that the consignment was misdelivered to some other person and the consignee should contact the USA local post office with a Complaint of mis-delivery by filling up Form No. 452.  It is stated in spite of giving the complete address of the consignee, the Postal Department had negligently delivered the consignment to a different person and thus committed deficiency of service.  Despite repeated efforts of the Complainant, the Postal Department did not get the consignment delivered to the correct person/client of the Complainant and also did not pay any damages to him.  Thus, the Complainant suffered a loss of $10350 and also loss of goodwill. Hence, the Complainant issued a legal notice dated 02.01.2013 to the Postal Department but there was no response.
4.       Aggrieved, the Complainant filed the Complaint before the District Forum seeking the following reliefs:-
“1)      That the respondents be directed to pay an amount of $10,350 along with interest @ 24% per annum to the complainant;
2)       The respondents be directed to pay an amount of ₹15,00,000/- on account of loss of reputation of the complainant and not delivering the consignment to the consignee and further delivering the consignment to some other persons due to the negligent services of the respondents;
3)       The respondents further be directed to pay an amount of ₹11,000/- being legal expenses;
4)       Any other award be made in favor of the complainant which this Forum deems fit and proper.”
5.       The Postal Department filed their Reply admitting therein that the Complainant had booked the subject consignment, but state that they are not aware of the contents of the said consignment/parcel as the Complainant produced the sealed parcel at the booking counter which was booked after accepting the required fees. It is denied that the Complainant repeatedly approached seeking information about whereabouts of the parcel but was not provided the same. It is stated that on receipt of the Complaint, the Postal Department immediately searched the website of the USPS for status of disposal of the parcel and as per the said website the subject parcel was delivered to one V. Kumar on 23.07.2002 at 4.07 p.m.  Complainant was informed about the same by the Postal Department vide its letter bearing No. SPC/JPO/OW/FOREIGN/02 dated 22.08.2002.  However, the Complainant again addressed a letter dated 25.09.2002 that the parcel was not received by the consignee and that the same was delivered to some other person and requested that the matter be investigated. The matter was hence investigated through USPS which advised that the consignee be informed to contact the local post office and fill Form No. 452 and the   Complainant was informed accordingly vide letter No. SPC/OW-371/FOREIGN/2002 dated 18.10.2002.  However, instead of approaching the Local US Post Office through form No. 452, Complainant filed the Complaint before the District Forum.  It is stated that there is no deficiency of service and unfair trade practice on the part of the Postal Department.  It is further pleaded that in terms of Section 6 of the Post Office Act, 1898, the Postal Department and its employees are free from all liabilities for the missing, mis-distributed, delay or damage in sending items. It is averred that the  Postal Department is a functionary of the state and does not involve  any commercial activity and hence the Complainant is not entitled to claim any relief/damages from the Department and the Complaint is liable to be dismissed with costs.
6.       We have heard the Learned Counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
7.       Learned Counsel appearing for the Postal department vehemently argued that the tracking report suggested that the articles were delivered at  4.07 p.m. on 23.07.2002 at Avenue Reckmond Hill, New York and that the item was received by one Mr V. Kumar. He further submitted that the Complainant had got the goods insured only for ₹1000 at the time of booking of the consignment and, therefore, both the fora below have committed irregularity in allowing the entire amount to be paid by the Department. It is also the case of the Petitioner/Department herein that as per Section 6 of the Post Office Act, 1898 the Department being a statutory body, the officials of the Postal Department discharge a sovereign act and, therefore, the services rendered by the Postal Department are constitutional in nature and they cannot be made liable.   Vide an order dated 16.02.2017 this Commission directed the Department to seek instructions as to whether any enquiry as requested by the Consignor vide letter dated 25.09.2002 was made by the Postal department and if so, the Department was directed to place on record the said report by way of an affidavit. When the matter was taken up on 20.07.2017 this Commission recorded as follows:-
“In pursuance of the query raised during the course of hearing on 16.02.2017 as to whether any enquiry, as requested by the consignor vide his letter dated 25.09.2002, had been made by the Postal Department, an affidavit has been filed by the Senior Superintendent, Post Office, Jaipur, wherein it is stated that on receipt of the Complaint from the consignor, the matter was taken up with the Manager, Speed Post Centre, New Delhi, who vide his letter dated 12.10.2002 had informed the Manager, Speed Fost Centre, Jaipur that an enquiry was made with U.S.P.S. Authorities 'on telephone"" and, according to them, the addressee may contact the local post office and file Form-452 for international enquiry. Accordingly, the Complainant was advised to contact the focal post office.
Prima facie, we are not satisfied with the said explanation. We defer our final opinion on the said stand but would direct the Chief Post Master General to examine the entire file pertaining to the case and submit his report on the issue involved in the present Revision Petitions, filed by its Foreign Postal Department. The evidence for the telephonic discussion between the Speed Post Centre, New Delhi and U.S.P.S. Authorities, along with the contents of the said talk, shall be placed on record by the Senior Superintendent, Post Office, Jaipur, who has filed the present affidavit. The requisite affidavit shall be filed within six weeks, as prayed.
List for hearing on admission on 13.09.2017.” (Emphasis supplied).
8.      In the affidavit filed by the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, it is deposed that the reply given by the petitioner to the consignor vide  letter dated 18.10.2002 was based on the information given by the Speed Post Centre, New Delhi and that a telephonic enquiry which was also made. It is stated that the Superintendent Foreign Post, New Delhi and the Manager CCC, AMPC, New Delhi informed the deponent that the record pertaining to the period during which the complaint was made was already weeded out and destroyed in due course and hence cannot be provided. From the averments made in the written version, the grounds of the revision petition, the submission of the Counsel and the affidavit filed by the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, it is evident that there is no documentary evidence to establish whether any enquiry was conducted with respect to the present case despite the fact that the  parcel which was sent contained precious and semi-precious stones. On a query from the Bench the Respondent drew our attention to the copy of the insurance policy covering the subject period, which establishes that the amount insured by New India Assurance Company Limited for the said quantity for finished, polished precious and semi-precious stones was valued at $19,910.65 as on 17.07.2002. The Marine declaration form further establishes this value.
9.       It is pertinent to mention that the Foreign Postal Department is completely silent with respect to the rules governing them while accepting a parcel. The declaration and the invoice showing precious and semi-precious stones was given as per the submission of the Complainants. For better understanding of the case the letter dated 22.08.2002 sent by the Complainant to the Petitioner requesting for institution of an enquiry regarding the missing parcel is reproduced as their under:-

10.     Admittedly, the Department had made a telephonic enquiry and the same was deposed in the affidavit filed by the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices. A more detailed enquiry ought to have been done by the Department in addition to the telephonic enquiry. At the cost of repetition, there is no material on record to establish that a detailed enquiry was ever done. The Insurance Policy filed by the Complainant establishes the value and nature of the consignment sent. We find that there was negligence on the part of the Petitioner, herein,  in not conducting any detailed enquiry with respect to the delivery of the subject parcel taking into consideration that it contained semi- precious stones and further it is not the case of the Postal Department that the  Complainant did not declare the contents of the parcel.
11.     Now we address ourselves to the submission made by the Learned Counsel appearing for the Postal Department that no liability can be fastened upon them as they are protected by Section 6 of the Post Office Act, 1898. At this juncture it is relevant to place reliance on an order of this Commission in Department of Post & Ors. Vs. Gajanand Sharma I(2017) CPJ 172 (NC), which has attained finality.  The ratio of the same is reproduced as under:-
“13. This Commission in Post Master General, West Bengal Circle, General Post Office GPO v. Dipak Banerjee & Anr, IV (2015) CPJ 329 (NC) has observed as under:-
’11.  The Section is in two parts. The first part provides for a complete immunity to the Government, unless some liability is undertaken by the Government under the statute in express terms. Similar immunity is extended to the officers of the post office. The second part carves out an exception to the blanket immunity to its officers and provides that they can incur liability if it is shown that the loss, misdelivery, delay or damage, etc. had been caused fraudulently or by the willful act or default of such an employee. Thus, a plain reading of the Section leaves little scope for doubt that unless it is proved that the loss, misdelivery or delay has been caused fraudulently or by a willful act or default on the part of its officer, no claim would lie against the Postal Department merely by reason of the loss, misdelivery or delay or damage to the postal article, as the case may be in the course of transmission of the article by post. In other words, the provision, an antiquated piece of legislation, dating back to the year 1898, grants total immunity to the Postal Department from incurring any liability for delay in delivery of the article in the course of its transmission by post, unless a fraud or willful act or default on the part of its employee is proved.
12. The object and reach of Section 6 of the said Act was elaborately explained by a five member Bench of this Commission in Post Master Imphal & Anr v Dr Jamini Devi Sagolband, I (2000) CPJ 28 (NC), with copious references to English and Indian Decisions by the Hon’ble Supreme Court  and various High Courts.  It was held that the relationship between the sender of a postal article and the post office is governed by the Indian Post Office Act and not by Law of Contract or Tort, and that there is no liability at all for loss or non-delivery of a postal article except in so far as specifically provided by the Statute under Section 33 and Section 6 or any other regulation or rule.’
14. Therefore, the question is, whether, the Complainant has proved that the delay in delivery of the letter, transmitted by Speed Post for delivery, was due to willful act or default on the part of an employee of the Postal Department?
15. It is a cardinal principle of law that ordinarily the burden of proving the fact rests on the party who asserts the affirmative issues and not on the party who denies it. Nevertheless, there is distinction between the phrase ‘burden of proof’ and ‘onus of proof’. Explaining the said fine distinction, in A. Raghavamma and Another v A. Chenchamma and Another, 1963 (SLT SOFT) 139= AIR 1964 SC 136, a three Judge Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that ""there is essential distinction between burden of proof and onus of proof.  Burden of proof lies on the person who has to prove a fact and it never shifts, but the onus of proof shifts. Such a shifting of onus is a continuous process in the evaluation of evidence.”
12.     In order to give effect to the objective of the Act, i.e.to provide for better protection of the interests of the consumers, if an addressee of the letter is able to create a reasonable degree of probability that there was willful default on the part of an employee of the Postal Department, the onus would shift on to the said department to discharge the onus to prove its denial, particularly when the addressee, the aggrieved party, does not have any access to the internal working of the post office.”
13.     From the afore-noted ratio it is seen that if an addressee is able to create a reasonable degree of probability that there was willful default on the part of the Postal Department or its employee the onus would shift to the Department to prove the same as the addressee does not any access to the internal working of the Post Office.  In the instance case  the only stand of the Postal Department is that the records pertaining to that period are not available and also that they had made a telephonic enquiry. It is also relevant to mention that there is no rule position brought on record by the Department herein when there is a case of loss/mis-delivery of a parcel in a foreign country.  Admittedly, the Complainant informed the Department on 22.09.2002 and again on 25.09.2002 stating that the parcel was not received but Department informed the Complainant only vide letter dated 18.10.2002 that the Complainant should contact the USPS Authorities through form No. 452 and, therefore, we are of the view that there is a willful default in not conducting a proper enquiry. Keeping in view the afore-noted reasons, we find the Postal department deficient in not conducting an enquiry and in being negligent with respect to following up the matter when a formal Complaint was made regarding the loss of the parcel. To reiterate, the Complainant has filed a copy of the New India Assurance Policy showing the value of the consignment sent during the subject period.  However, there is  contributory negligence on the part of the Complainant in insuring the parcel with the Postal Department for only an amount of ₹1000/-, and, therefore, we are of the considered view that both the Fora  below ought not to have directed the Department to pay the entire value of the consignment. Keeping in view the afore-noted reasons, in the interest of justice and to balance equities, 50% of the value of the consignment as on the date of the District Forum order, be paid to the Complainant. Time for compliance within four weeks failing which the amount shall attract interest @ 9% from the date of filing of the Complaint till the date of realization. Revision Petition is partly allowed to the extent indicated above.
RP No. 3118/2016
14.     It is the Complainant’s case that he had booked two parcels with the Postal Department on 04.10.2002 valuing $10,400 to be sent to his customer at Sweet Creek Creation L.L.C 1785, Lawrence Place Florence, Oregon, USA.  It is not in dispute that one of the parcels i.e. 830096741 (IN) weight 18,928 grams reached its destination.  It is the Complainant’s case that the second parcel i.e. EE830096755 IN did not reach its destination.  After repeated requests he was informed vide letter dated 03.01.2003 that the said parcel reached at Kennady AMC on 07.10.2002 but no information was provided with respect to further delay.  Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainant submitted that only after filing of the Written Version before the District Forum the Complainant was informed that the parcel EE 830096755 (IN) reached its destination on 27.01.2003 and the receipt of the parcel was signed by one Mr. D. John.
","15.     It is the case of the Postal Department that an affidavit was filed by the Senior Superintendent Post Office, Jaipur on 09.03.2017 before this Commission stating that after the receipt of letter dated 25.11.2002, the matter was taken with Speed Post Centre, New Delhi.  The Manager of the said Centre informed Jaipur Post Office on 15.02.2003 that the said article in question was despatched from SPC, New Delhi on 04.10.2002 vide dispatch No. 220 and it reached USA on 07.10.2002 and on the same day was sent to customs.  There was no delay and the article was finally delivered on 27.01.2003 and the same was informed in the reply notice. In compliance of the order of this Commission the track reports dated 03.01.2003 and 01.02.2003 were filed.  The track report dated 03.01.2003 states that item arrived in the United States at Kennedy AMC at 2.28 a.m. on 07.10.2002 and thereafter no further information is available.  It is stated that ‘earlier it was sent to customs’.  It can be seen from the said tracking report of United States Postal Department Service that the parcel bearing No. EE830096755 IN was delivered at 11.19 a.m. at the said address and was signed by one Mr. D. Johnson.  Hence we are of the considered view that there is no evidence brought on record by the Complainant that the item was not delivered.  If the item has been detained by Customs the Postal Department cannot be made to pay any compensation.  However, it is seen from the record that the item was despatched on 04.10.2002, reached USA on 07.10.2002 and there was absolutely no information given to the Complainant though he had repeatedly asked for details with respect to delivery of the said consignment as he had sent two parcels on the same day and only one  parcel was delivered and there was no information about the second. Further the period during which the parcel was lying in the customs is not supported by any documentary evidence.  Admittedly, despite repeated requests,  letter dated 25.11.2002 and Legal Notice dated 17.09.2002, the Postal Department informed the Complainant only on 03.01.2003.  The parcel contained precious and semi-precious stones and the mental agony suffered by the Complainant on account of lack of information by the Postal Department cannot be undermined.  In this case also, the ratio in Gajanand Sharma (supra) regarding the onus of proof shifts to the Department to prove its denial when the facts establish that there is a reasonable degree of probability that there was wilful default on behalf of the Department/or its employee, squarely applies as the Department has failed to establish by way of any documentary evidence that it has informed the Complainant immediately of the exact period when it was lying with the Customs. However, since the track report evidences that the article had finally reached its destination on 27.01.2003, we are of the considered view that both the Fora below have erred in awarding the entire amount.  We are of the view that only compensation can be awarded for the delay in intimating the Complainant for which an amount of ₹1,00,000/- would meet the ends of justice.  This amount is inclusive of both compensation and costs.  Revision Petition is allowed in part with the afore-noted directions.  Time for compliance within four weeks failing which the amount shall attract interest @ 9% from the date of filing of the Complaint till the date of realization.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
This revision petition is directed against the order of the State Commission dated 22.7.2015 whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner against the order of the District Forum was dismissed in default and for non-prosecution. Being aggrieved from the dismissal of his appeal, the petitioner is before this Commission.
2.      A perusal of the impugned order would show that on the date, the said order came to be passed, an application seeking adjournment was filed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The State Commission noted that on an earlier occasion, i.e., 21.1.2015 another adjournment application had been allowed, subject to payment of Rs.500/- as cost but that cost had not been paid. It was also noted that an adjournment was also granted to the petitioner on 7.10.2014. One more adjournment was granted to the petitioner on 22.4.2015. Thus as many as three adjournments had been granted to the petitioner. Though the conduct of the petitioner in seeking one adjournment after the other before the State Commission, does not justify any indulgence, considering that he is an ex-army person and claims to be a consumer, I am inclined to grant more opportunity to the petitioner to argue his appeal on merits, before the State Commission.
3.      Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, the impugned order is set aside and the appeal filed by the petitioner before the State Commission is restored, subject to the petitioner depositing an additional amount of Rs.10,000/- as cost with the Legal Aid Account of the State Commission within eight weeks from today. The parties shall appear before the State Commission on 22.9.2020. No adjournment to any party shall be given on that date and the matter will be heard on merits.

2.      Vide the present revision petitions, the petitioner has challenged his liability to execute the sale deed.  It is submitted that the fora below has wrongly imposed the liability upon him to execute the sale deed.  It is submitted that the petitioner is not bound to execute the sale deed since the respondents no.1,2 & 3 who were his contractors, had sold the houses, which were constructed by them under the agreement dated 17.7.1987 in violation of terms and conditions of this agreement.  It is argued that in terms of the said agreement, as per condition no.2 the liability of the petitioner to execute the sale deeds would have arisen only if the respondent no.1,2 & 3 had sold the houses to the persons as per the list to be provided by him to the respondents.
3.      On enquiry, learned counsel for petitioner submits that she is not aware if any such list had ever been supplied by the petitioner to respondent no.1,2 & 3.
4.      I have given consideration to the arguments of learned counsel, the plea and contention of petitioner before this Commission is that allotments were not made by respondent no.1,2 & 3 as per the list which was required to be submitted by the petitioner to respondent no.1,2 & 3 and hence no liability can be fixed upon the petitioner and therefore the fora below have wrongly exercised their jurisdiction.  It is also argued that there is no privity of contract between the petitioner and the complainants.
5.      Learned counsel for respondent no.1,2 & 3 have argued that the respondents have sold the houses and accepted money for its construction under the scheme in terms of condition No.2 of the agreement dated 17.07.1987 and that there is no violation of any terms and conditions of this agreement.  It is further submitted that allotment has been made as per the list provided by the petitioner.  It is submitted that due to this conduct of the petitioner which is nothing less than blackmailing the respondent no.1,2 & 3, it is the complainants who has been suffering and despite them being in possession of the subject properties,  they do not have a covenant conferring title of the property on them.  It is submitted that the petitioners had submitted a list of allottees of the property under the scheme to the competent authority and the State Commission had perused the said order of the Competent authority and Additional Collector Office, Bahumali Building, Nanpura, Surat dated 30.06.1993   by which the petitioner was granted permission under Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, 1976 for constructing 28 houses of A type, 32 houses of B type and 18 houses of C type.  Thus permission was given to raise construction of total 78 houses and the houses were allotted to the complainants as per the said list.  It is argued that the argument of the petitioner is baseless.
6.      The learned counsel for respondent no.1 to 3 has produced the documents i.e the order dated 30.06.1993 containing names of complainants on which the State Commission has relied.
7.      This document, which forms part of the State Commission Order, has not been filed by the petitioner, alongwith the present revision petitions.  The copy is  thus taken on record since it is an important document and relied upon by State Commission in impugned order is placed in revision petition No.1371 of 2018.
8.      Learned counsel appearing on behalf of majority of complainants has submitted that it is the complainant who is suffering in fight of rights between petitioner and respondent no.1,2 & 3.
9.      I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of learned counsels and have perused the file.  The jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) is very limited.  Where there are concurrent findings on the facts, this Commission is debarred from re-appreciating and reassessing the evidences and substituting it with its own opinion.  Only when there is wrong exercise of jurisdiction or the order is perverse that this Commission can intervene.
10.    In the present case, it is argued by the petitioner that there was no privity of contract between them and the complainants and, therefore, the liability has been wrongly imposed upon them. The petitioner is owner of the property on which construction was raised.  Admittedly he applied for permission to construct 78 AWAS for the backward classes on his land under a scheme of the Government for consideration of AWAS for backward classes people.  He engaged respondent no.1,2 & 3 for constructing those houses while seeking  permission, petitioner had also submitted the list of the beneficiaries under the said scheme i.e. the list of the persons to whom houses would be allotted under the said scheme.  Admittedly while granting permission vide order dated 30.06.1993, the concerned authority duly approved the list of allottees.  Since petitioner was the owner and it is he who had raised the construction on his property and respondent no.1,2 & 3, according to him were engaged as contractors to raise construction, it is he with whom the complainants have privity of contract.  The name of the complainants appears on the list submitted by the petitioner to the concerned authorities, while seeking permission under the Scheme.  Respondent no.1,2 &3 have drawn my attention to the documents showing the receipts of the money, showing that the consideration money had been received by the petitioner from the complaints.  The petitioner has also intentionally concealed these documents and have not filed it with the present revision petition.  These documents clearly establishes that it is the petitioner who had received  the money i.e. sale price from the complainants. Having received the sale
price from complainants and petitioner being owner, his act of refusing to execute the sale deed amounts to gross deficiency in service.  The arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner that allotments were made to the persons in violation Clause 2 of the Agreement by the respondent No.1,2 & 3 also has no merit.  The findings of the State Commission is based on document executed by petitioner himself and which petitioner has not denied rather has intentionally concealed it.  It, therefore, cannot be said that State Commission had wrongly exercised its jurisdiction or its findings are perverse.
11.    The above mention conduct of the petitioner clearly shows that the petitioner although with a good intention raised the construction on his property of 78 houses for allotment to the people of backward classes and got the approval from the competent authority and in terms of that, possession was handed over to the complainants on and around the year 1997 yet for the last about 23 years, he has not executed the sale deed and had been contesting the matters on the ground which were false to his own knowledge and were meritless and he is also guilty of concealing material documents.
12.    Hence, while dismissing these revision petitions, I impose a cost of Rs.10,000/- upon the petitioner to be paid to each of the complainant in each Revision Petition by way of demand draft within four weeks.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
No one is present for the respondents despite service.  I have therefore, heard the learned counsel for the complainants/appellants and have considered the record.
2.      The complainants/appellants booked small commercial spaces with the respondents in a project namely ‘KST Metropolitan Shopping Arcade’, which the respondent was to develop in Sector-89 of Faridabad.  On allotment of commercial spaces to the complainants, they executed Memorandum of Understanding with the respondents incorporating the respective rights and obligations of the parties in respect of the commercial spaces allotted to the complainants/appellants.  As per clause 5 of the Memorandum of Understanding, commercial spaces were to be constructed and completed within 36 months thereof subject to force majeure circumstances.  The project having not even started by the opposite parties despite payment having been made by them, they approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking refund of the amount which they paid to the respondents alongwith compensation etc.
3.      No one appeared for the respondents before the District Forum and no written version was filed.  The respondents were therefore, proceeded ex-parte.
4.      Vide impugned order dated 01.02.2018, the State Commission dismissed the complaints solely on the ground that the complainants/appellants had failed to prove that the commercial spaces were booked by them for the purpose of earning their livelihood by way of self-employment.
5.      The question as to when a person buying goods or hiring or availing service, can be said to be a consumer, came up for the consideration of a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in Tosoh India Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly Lilac Medicare Pvt. Ltd.) Vs. Ram Kumar & Ors. RP/2833/2018 decided on 06.01.2020 and the following view was taken:
(a)     Only a person engaged in large scale commercial activities for the purpose of making profit is not a consumer;
(b)     There should be a direct nexus between the large scale commercial activities in which a person is engaged and the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by him, before he can be excluded from the purview of the term ‘consumer’.  Therefore any goods purchased or the services hired or availed even by a person carrying on business activities on a large scale for the purpose of making profit will not take him out of the definition of the term ‘consumer’, if the transaction of purchases of goods or hiring or availing of services is not intended to generate profit through the large scale commercial activity undertaken by him and does not contribute to or form an essential part of his large scale commercial activities.
(c)     What is crucial for the purpose of determining whether a person is a ‘consumer’ or not is the purpose for which the goods were purchased or the services were hired or availed and not the scale of his commercial activities.
(d)    The explanation below Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act is clarificatory in nature.
(e)     A person purchasing goods or hiring or availing services for a consideration, for the purpose of earning his livelihood by way of self-employment is a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
6.      On a perusal of the record, I find that though the complainants had specifically averred in the Consumer Complaint that they had booked commercial spaces in order to earn their livelihood, they did not specify in the complaints as to for what specific purpose, the commercial space were booked by them nor did they disclose as to what business or profession they would have carried out in the aforesaid commercial spaces after taking their possession.  In fact, they did not even say in the Consumer Complaint that they would have personally worked in the commercial premises which they had booked with the respondents.  However, I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the appellant that they should be given opportunity to satisfy the State Commission by filing an additional affidavit or otherwise that they had booked commercial spaces with the respondents for the purpose of earning their livelihood by way of self-employment.  If the appellants state so on oath, that should, in the absence of any rebuttal, be sufficient to prove their case in this regard provided that the complainants/appellants also disclose in their affidavit the specific business/profession in which they wanted to engage after taking the possession of the commercial spaces from the respondents.  They will also be entitled to file additional documents with their respective affidavits, if they so desire.
7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned orders are set aside and the Consumer Complaints filed by the appellants/complainants are remitted back to the State Commission to decide the same afresh after considering the affidavit in terms of the liberty granted to the appellants/complainants by this Commission.  The affidavits in terms of this liberty shall be filed before the State Commission within six weeks from today.  The appellants/complainants shall appear before the concerned State Commission on 13.04.2020.  On that date, the State Commission, subject to the appellants/complainants filing affidavits in terms of this order, shall proceed to decide the Consumer Complaints afresh, on merits.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
On 01.08.2003 an agreement was executed between Reddy Construction Company (hereinafter referred to  as “the builder”), appellant in FA No. 462 of 2012, and Prakash @ Deepak Dattaram @ Dattu Gaikwad  (hereinafter referred to as “the owner”),  appellant in FA No. 281 of 2012 whereunder a building was to be constructed by the builder on the land of the owner and total built-up area of 4245 sq. ft. exclusive of balcony and staircase area was to be provided by the builder to the owner.   Out of the said area 1595 sq. ft. of built-up area was to be constructed for commercial purpose on the ground floor of the proposed building whereas 2650 sq. ft. of the said area was to be constructed for residential purposes on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the proposed building.
2.      A tarpartite agreement was thereafter executed between the builder, owner and the complainant on 15.10.2003, whereunder the complainant, who was a tenant of the owner in the old structure which the builder was to demolish, was to be given 600 sq. ft. carpet area of the residential construction on the 6th floor of the proposed building and 70 sq. ft.  carpet area of the commercial construction on the ground floor, facing road.  The residential area was to be provided within 18 months whereas the commercial area was to be provided within six months.
3.      The case of the complainant is that the actual area of the residential flat provided to him was short by 77 sq. ft., his other grievance being that the commercial area in the form of a shop having carpet area of 70 sq. ft. on the ground floor of the building was not provided to him.  He, therefore, approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint.
The complaint was resisted by the builder as well as by the owner.  The builder alleged that the area of flat No. 602 which was in the use of the complainant was about 66/12 sq. ft. of carpet area.  As regards the commercial area it was claimed by that the complainant had given up her right to the said commercial area and had received cash compensation in lieu thereof.
The State Commission vide impugned order dated 04.04.2012 directed as under:-
“2. The opponents, jointly and severally do pay compensation of Rs. 10 Lakhs towards less area of the flat and Rs. 2 lakhs towards mental agony and sufferance of the complainant to the complainant.  This compensation be paid within period of 45 days from today and failing which it shall carry interest @ 18% p.a. till its realization.
3. The opponents, jointly and severally, do hand over possession of 70 sq. ft. commercial carpet area situated on ground floor, facing road as synonymous to description of shop No. 1 in the original plan to the complainant from the building known as “Reddy’s Shree Shivdatta” constructed on land bearing CTS No. 801/1 to 801/6, 746/3 and 746/4, Survey No. 104(pt) admeasuring about 423 st. mtrs. At Village Pahadi, Goregaon Taluka Borivali, Mumbai.
ALTERNATIVELY
The opponents, jointly and severally shall pay a compensation of Rs. 21 lakhs to the complainant along with interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of filing of this complaint i.e. 27.07.2010 till its realization.”
Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the complainant, the builder as well as the owner are before this Commission by way of these appeals.
4.      It would thus be seen from the agreement that the builder was to construct 1595 square feet of commercial area out of which 1078 square feet was to be constructed on the ground floor and provide the same to the owner who in turn, was to provide 70 square feet of commercial area on the ground floor to the complainant. Admittedly, no commercial area has been provided to the complainant though the residential flat has been provided to him. The case of the owner is that pursuant to an understanding between him and the complainant some compensation was paid to the complainant in lieu of the commercial space to be provided on the ground floor. However, there is no written agreement between the parties for giving compensation to the complainant in lieu of the commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet on the ground floor. Admittedly, no payment by way of cheque/demand draft etc. has been made by the owner to the complainant in lieu of the commercial area. I am unable to accept the oral agreement/understanding pleded by the owner in this regard. Considering that the parties and executed a detailed agreement incorporating their respective rights and obligations in respect of the bargain agreed between them it is difficult to accept that the owner had arrived at an oral understanding without reducing the alleged oral understanding into writing and thereafter made cash payment without making even a part of the alleged payment by way of a cheque/demand draft. Such a course of action was not likely in the ordinary course of human conduct considering that the agreement between the parties had been executed in writing and was a detailed agreement to which not only the owner and the complainant but the builder was also a party. Therefore, I have no hesitation in accepting the finding returned by the State Commission in this regard and confirming that a complainant is entitled to be suitable compensated either by providing a commercial space of equal size in a comparable building and locality or he is entitled to suitable monetary compensation in lieu of the said commercial area.
5.      The State Commission awarded an amount of Rs.21 lakhs to the complainant based upon the newspaper reports. The newspaper report do not constitute legal admissible evidence to prove the market value of a property. No sale deed was produced before the State Commission to prove the market value of the commercial area in the building constructed by the builder or in a similarly situated commercial property. Even the ready reckoner price prevailing on the date of complaint was not brought to the notice of the State Commission. The ready reckoner price reflects the minimum market price of the property in a particular area, be it a rehabilitation building or otherwise.  The prevailing market price is not likely to be less than the ready reckoner price, though it can be on the higher side.  Considering all the facts and circumstances including the failure of the parties to produce any evidence with respect to the market value of a comparable commercial premises, I am the considered  view that instead of paying Rs. 21 lacs along-with interest awarded by State Commission the owner as well as the builder should pay an amount equivalent  to the current ready reckoner price of a commercial space admeasuring 70 square feet in the locality in which this building has been constructed by the builder. The said amount shall be calculated and paid to the complainant within 6 weeks from today failing which  it will be  recoverable through the process of the State Commission.
6.      It is submitted by learned counsel for the owner that the builder should be responsible to compensate the complainant for the commercial space since commercial space admeasuring 1078 sq. ft.on the ground floor was not provided by the builder to the owner. The submission of the learned counsel for the developer on the other hand is that it is for the owner alone to compensate the complainant in this regard since commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet was to be provided to her by the owner out of the area to be given to him by the builder and the builder handed over the area as per the agreement between the parties to the owner. The learned counsel for the owner however maintains that commercial area admeasuring 1078 sq. ft on the ground floor was never provided to the owner by the builder. Be that as it may the builder as well as the owner both are jointly and severally liable to compensate the complainant in respect to the commercial area both of them being party to the agreement executed with the complainant in this regard on 15.10.2003. In fact had the builder not been a party to the said agreement the complement, in all likelihood, would not have even  entered into this transaction with the owner since he knew that it was the builder who would have to construct the building in which commercial space will have to be provided to him by the owner.
Moreover, there is no evidence of the owner having taken any action against the builder for not providing commercial area admeasuring 1078 sq. ft on the ground floor of the building to him. This indicates that the owner had foregone the commercial area to be provided to him under the agreement with the builder in terms of some understanding between him and the builder. If this is so, there is no reason why the owner should not compensate the complainant in lieu of commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet of on ground floor of the building. As far as the builder is concerned, he would be liable for two reasons, first reason being that he was also a party the commitment made to the complainant in this regard vide agreement dated 15.10.2003 and the second reason being that he has not constructed a shop of 70 sq. ft. on the ground floor despite knowing fully well that commercial area admeasuring 70 square feet has to be provided to the complainant under an agreement to which he was also a party.
At this stage the learned counsel for the builder submits that they had actually provided the commercial area as per the agreement dated 01.08.2003 to the owner. At this stage learned counsel for the owner submits though the builder had provided 1078 sq. ft of the commercial area on the ground floor to the owner, shop admeasuring  70 sq. ft.  for the complainant was neither got approved not constructed. In my opinion, since both the owner as well as a builder were party to the agreement dated 15.10.2003 the builder ought to have constructed a shop admeasuring 70 square feet on the ground  floor and provided the same to the owner, for making it available to the complainant. Therefore both the builder as well as the owner would be liable to compensate the complainant, the liability of the builder arising on account of his being a party to the tripartite agreement dated 15.01.2003 and his having not got approved and constructed a shop admeasuring 70 square feet.
7.      The State Commission has awarded compensation quantified at Rs. 2,00,000/- to the complainant for the mental agony and harassment undergoing by him. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case including the delay in delivery of possession of the residential flat the aforsaid compensation was fully justified and does not call for any interference by this commission in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. It will also pertinent to note that though there was delay in offering possession of residential flat which was to be made available within 18 months of the agreement no interest by way of compensation for the delay in possession of the flat was specifically claimed in the consumer complaint  and only a flat compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- for the mental agony and harassment was claimed.
8.      The next grievance of the complainant is with respect to the shortfall in the area of the flat which the owner has provided to him. As per the agreement executed between the parties on 15.10.2003 the complainant was entitled to a residential flat having carpet area of 600 square feet exclusive of the balcony area and staircase.
9.      This Commission appointed Mr. Hitendra K Mehta as the court commissioner to inspect the flat provided to the complainant and measure its area etc. The report of Mr. Mehta to the extent it is relevant in this regard reads as under:-
“MEASUREMENTS & ACTUAL INTERNAL/CARPET AREA OF THE FLAT:-
As per actual measures, the internal/carpet area of the flat under reference, is as given below:-
INTERNAL/CARPET AREA:
LIVING ROOM          : 10’-1”(E-W) X 19’-2 ½ (N-S)         = 193.64 SQ. FT.
KITCHEN                  : 10’-0”(E-W) X 7’-4”  (N-S)             = 73.30 SQ. FT.
KITCHEN ENTRANCE
OPENING                  : 2’-10”(E-W) X 0’-5” (N-S)              = 1.21 SQ. FT.
POOJA ROOM         : 6’-5”(E-W) X 4’-2” (N-S)                 = 26.77 SQ. FT.
INTERNAL PASSAGE
BETWEEEN ENT. OF
M. BED & BEDRM-II: 4’-4”(E-W) X 2’-11” (N-S)              = 12.64 SQ. FT.
MASTER BEDROOM AT
SOUTH WEST          : 12’-6”(E-W) X 10’-6” (N-S)            = 131.25 SQ. FT.
ATTACHED TOILET WITH
MASTER BEDROOM: 3’-11”(E-W) X 7’-0” (N-S)            = 27.44 SQ. FT.
BEDROOM-II
AT NORTH-WEST   : 13’-0”(E-W) X 9’-3” (N-S)              = 120.25 SQ. FT.
ATTACHED TOILET
WITH BEDROOM-II : 6’-7½ ”(E-W) X 3’-3” (N-S)            = 21.52 SQ. FT.
TOTAL                        =608.02 SQ. FT.
(56.51 SQ. MTS.)
THUS, THE ‘INTERNAL/CARPET AREA’ OF THE SAID FLAT, AS PER ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT, WORKS OUT TO 608.02 SQ. FT. (56.51 SQ. MTS.).”
It would thus be seen that as per the report of the court commissioner the area of the flat provided to the complainant is 608.02 square feet. He has separately measured living room, kitchen, pooja room etc. etc. it is evident that the area measured by him does not include either the balcony of the staircase.
10.    The learned counsel for the complainant, however, has drawn my attention to the following part the report of Mr. Mehta:-
“In the said approved plan, it is mentioned that the carpet area of the rooms, toilets and passages of the said flat is 48.60 Sq. Mtrs., which works out to 522.94 Sq. Ft. (which is excluding area of enclosed balconies (merged within rooms), admeanuring 58.12 sq Ft and also excluding  area of additional space of ‘POOJA ROOM', admeasuring 26.77 Sq. Ft.)
As the said area is excluding areas of enclosed balconies, (merged within rooms), the total actual internal/carpet area of the said flat, with reference to abovementioned approved plan works out as given below:-
INTERNAL/CARPET AREA:
AS PER APPROVED PLANS
CARPET AREA OF  ROOMS,
INTERNAL PASSAGE & TOILETS             =        522.94 SQ. FT. (48.60 SQ.
MTS.)
ADD:
CARPET AREA OF ENCLOSED
BALCONIES, MERGED WITH
THE ROOMS,
10’-0”(3.05 m) X 1’-6” (0.45M): 15.00 SQ. FT.
9’-2”(2.80 m) X 0’-11 ¾ ” (0.30): 8.99 SQ. FT.
10’-6”(3.20 m)) X 3’-3” (0.60M): 34.13 SQ. FT. =  58.12 SQ. FT. (5.40 SQ.
MTS.)
B) ADD: FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE
‘POOJA ROOM’
6-5”(1.96 m)) X 4’-2” (1.27M):                                 = 26.77 SQ. FT.(2.49 SQ.
MTS.)
TOTAL            = 607.83 SQ. FT. (56.49 SQ.
MTS.)
THUS, AS COMPARED WITH COPY OF APPROVED PLAN & BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ‘POOJA ROOM’ (BEING AN ADDITIONAL SPACE IN PORSESSION OF THE SAID OCCUPANT), THE INTERNAL/CARPET AREA' OF THE SAID FLAT, WORKS OUT TO 607.83 SQ. FT. (56.49 SQ. MTS).
THOUGH, IT 1S NOT WITHIN BCOPE OP MY ASSIGNMENT (AS PER THE ORDER OF HONBLE NATIONAL COMMISSION, DATED 03-05-2019), TO COMPARE THE CARPET AREA WITH REFERENCE TO APPROVED PLAN, IT IS MENTIONED ABOVE, AS ‘OTHER OBSERVATIONS’, ONLY FOR THE REASON THAT THE COPY OF APPROVED PLAN HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO ME, AT THE TIME OF MY SITE VISIT.
AS MENTIONED ADOVE, IN THE PRECEEDING CLAUSE, THE  ACTUAL INTERNAL/CARPET AREA OF PLAT NO. 602 UNDER REPERENCE, AS PER ACTUAL MEASUREMENTS CARRIED OUT BY ME IS 608.02 SQ.FT (56.51 SQ MTS.).
11.    The extract from thereport relied upon by the learned counsel of the complainant shows only this much that as per the approved plans the area of the flat exclusive of the carpet area of the balcony which has been merged with the rooms, was 522.94 square feet. It appears from a conjoint  reading of the report that though the carpet area of the flat as per the approved plan would be less than 600 square feet if the balcony area is to be excluded but the actual carpet area provided to the complainant was more than 600 square feet. This has happened on account of the balcony having been merged with the rooms. Therefore, interpreted in the terms of the agreement between the parties there is no shortfall in the carpet area made available to the complainant, the total carpet area available to her being 608.02 square feet. Though this has been done by merging the balcony area with the rooms, the said area has become part of the rooms, on account of the said merger.  After the merger with the room, the said area can.no more be said to be balcony.  Though the balcony area has either reduced or altogether disappeared on account of the said merger, this is not the case of the complainant that the owner and the builder were also required to provide balcony, in addition to the rooms etc.  Had the balcony been provided, the builder and the owner could not have included the area in the carpet area of the flat, but the balcony having not been provided and its area having been merged with the rooms, the complainant is using and enjoying the said area as rooms and not as the balconies.   Therefore, the complainant, in my opinion, is not entitled to any compensation on account of alleged shortfall in the area of the flat. I, therefore, need not examine the question as to whether the consumer complaint, having been filed more than 2 years after taking possession was time barred or not, as far as the grievance with respect to shortfall in the carpet area of the flat is concerned.
12.    It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the complainant that  out of the amenities promised in the agreement, some amenities were not provided, the said amenities, according to him, being  (1) marble slab in the kitchen was not provided (2) the tiles in the kitchen were not provided upto the roof level and (3) capacity of the storage tank was less than what had been added. Admittedly, the possession of the flat was taken by the complainant on 01.07.2007. The cause of action to claim compensation for not providing those amenities or for a direction to provide those amenities arose to the complainant on that date. The consumer complaint, therefore,  ought to have been instituted within 2 years thereof of, the prescribed period of limitation in terms of section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act being 2 years from the date of accrual of the cause of action. The consumer complaint having been instituted in July 2010 was clearly barred by limitation as for as the deficiencies in the said amenities are concerned.
","13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of with the following directions:-
(a)     The builder M/s Reddy Constructions and the owner Prakash @ Deepak Dattaram @ Dattu Gaikwad shall execute agreement in terms of Section 4 of MOFA in favour of the complainant in respect of the residential flat in question within 6 weeks from today. The requisite stamp duty and registration charges for the said agreement will be paid by them as per the agreement dated 15.10.2003.
(b)     The complainant shall be enrolled as a member of the Cooperative Housing Society consisting of the apartment owners in the aforesaid building within 6 weeks from today.
(c)     The builder and owner shall pay the current ready reckoner price in respect of the commercial shop on the ground floor of the building in question to the complainant within 6 weeks from today.
(d)     The owner and the builder shall also pay a sum of Rs 2 lacs as compensation to the complaint for the mental agony and harassment underground by her.
(e)     The builder and the owner shall pay  cost of litigation quantified at Rs. 50,000/- to the complainant within 6 weeks from today.
14.    Since a sum of Rs.12 lacs has already been paid to the complainant the compensation amount of Rs. 2 lakhs payable to her shall be adjusted out of the said amount. The balance amount shall be adjusted out of the compensation payable to her in respect of the commercial shop which was to be provided to her on the ground floor of the building.
The learned Counsel for the owner is permitted to file his vakalatnama  during the course of the day.

The present revision petition has been filed by Mr Om Prakash Swami against the order dated 01.02.2017 of the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (‘the State Commission) in First Appeal no. 25 of 2016.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the complainant booked a residential plot with the respondent/ opposite party. On 05.08.2004, he shifted from his old address and informed the same to the opposite party on 14.08.2004. On 07.10.2005, the complainant shifted to permanent address and again informed the same to the OP on 14.10.2005. It was stated on 30.09.2004, the opposite party sent a letter asking the complainant to take physical possession and complete the construction on the said plot up to 29.09.2006. It was stated that the said letter was not received by the complainant as the same was sent at the old address and in the meantime the complainant paid the regular instalments. It was alleged that though the complainant had paid all instalments on time but the opposite party still charged higher amount and he had to live on rent by spending money due to the delay in possession of plot to him. Hence, the petitioner filed a consumer complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum – VI (District New Delhi) (‘the District Forum’).
3.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Petitioner was the complainant before the District Forum in Complaint Case no.CC/370 of 2007 filed by the petitioner. The District Forum vide its order dated 26.11.2015 passed the following order:
“After considering the rival case of both the parties, we hold OP deficient in service to the extent of imposing penalty of Rs.89,346/- without proof of delivery of letter of offer of possession as admitted by Ops in its letter of 02.01.2006 placed on record.
We direct the OP to return this amount with interest of 9% from the date of deposit till payment. No compensation on other grounds in the prayer can be granted. If any other interest is charged on this demand of Rs.89,346/- that will also be reversed. We award a compensation of Rs.35,000/- inclusive of litigation expenses for harassment and deficiency.
The order shall be complied with within 30 days of the receipt of the copy of the order, otherwise action can be taken against OP under Section 25/27 of the Consumer Protection Act.”
4.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the complainant as well as the opposite party both filed appeals being FA nos.25 and 183 of 2016 before the State Commission. The State Commission vide its common order dated 01.02.2017 decided both the appeals as under:
","“In view of the above discussion, the appeal of the complainant bearing no.25/16 is dismissed.  Appeal of OP bearing No.183/16 is accepted in part and impugned order is modified to the effect that OP will refund Rs.89,346/- along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of payment till the date of refund.  Order directing compensation of Rs.35,000/- is set aside.”
5.     Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the present revision petition has been filed by the petitioner/ complainant. Learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that the State Commission has dismissed the order of the District Forum in respect of grant of Rs.35,000/- as compensation for mental agony and harassment to the complainant without any reasons. Learned counsel states that the complainant has suffered for many years due to the deficiency on the part of the opposite party. Learned counsel has further mentioned that the District Forum and the State Commission has not decided the application for refund of non-construction charges paid to the opposite party for Rs.44,760/- which was in violation of the stay order granted by the District Forum. Therefore, it was also prayed that this amount may also be ordered to be refunded by the opposite party to the complainant.
6.     On the other hand the learned counsel for the respondent/ opposite party has stated that after the order of the District Forum dated 26.11.2015 both the parties preferred appeals before the State Commission. The appeal of the complainant was dismissed by the State Commission. In the appeal filed by the complainant before the State Commission, the only prayer was made to enhance the compensation of Rs.35,000/- which was granted by the District Forum. Learned counsel has further stated that the respondent/ opposite party has already complied with the order of the State Commission and the amount has been paid to the complainant along with interest as per the order of the State Commission. Thus, nothing remains in the matter.
7.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. From the perusal of the order of the District Forum, it seems that the complainant has suffered harassment and mental agony from the actions/ omissions of the opposite party and therefore, Rs.35,000/- as compensation was ordered which seems justified. The State Commission, on the other hand, has set aside this compensation on the ground that the complainant has also been held liable for contributory negligence.  It is the case of the complainant that he changed the address only once, whereas the State Commission has recorded in its order that the complainant was repeatedly changing the address. It has been found by both the fora below that the OP was deficient and that is why Rs.89,346/- has been ordered to be refunded by both the fora below. Thus, in our view, the complainant is entitled to get some compensation for the mental agony and harassment and for deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party. From this aspect, the order of the District Forum in respect of grant of Rs.35,000/- as compensation is required to be upheld.
8.     So far as the question of refund of non-construction charges of Rs.44,760/- is concerned, it is seen that the main argument of the complainant in this regard is that this has been taken in violation of the interim order dated 24.04.2007 of the District Forum. When the final order has been passed in the complaint case, clearly the interim order merges into the main order and in the main final order, there is no order for restraining the OP from recovering non-construction charges. Thus, we do not find any merit in the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that non-construction charges paid by the complainant should be refunded by the opposite party.
9.     On the basis of the above discussion, the revision petition no. 883 of 2017 is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission dated 01.02.2017 in respect of setting aside the order of the District Forum for granting Rs.35,000/- as compensation to the complainant is set aside. The respondent/ opposite party is directed to pay Rs.35,000/- as compensation to the petitioner/complainant.
10.   This order be complied with by the opposite party within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

","PER MR PREM NARAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
The present consumer complaint has been filed by Mr Raj Kumar Goyal against the opposite Parties – Jalandhar Improvement Trust and Anr.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that draw was conducted by the opposite parties and the applicant/ complainant was a successful allottee. The opposite parties sent a letter of allotment dated 23.12.2011 to the complainant regarding allotment of residential plot no.83 D measuring 356 sq yards for a total consideration of Rs.56,90,030/-. The said allotment letter also contained the description of the terms and conditions under which the said plot was allotted. On 20.01.2012, for the purpose of entering into an agreement with the opposite parties, the complainant visited the office of the opposite parties and executed agreement as envisaged in the allotment letter. Opposite parties were under obligation to immediately deliver the possession of the residential plot to the complainant. However, opposite parties did not perform their part of the obligation. Opposite party no.2 also promised to send a copy of the agreement to the complainant within a week. However, the opposite parties have not yet supplied the copy of the said agreement to the complainant. The complainant has also deposited the amount of Rs.11,51,030/- (1/4 of the remaining amount + cess charge + site plan + agreement fee) vide receipt no.50621 dated 20.01.2012.
3.     In the month of June 2015, the complainant came to know that the land under which the scheme was carved out by the opposite parties was under serious litigation before the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh. On coming to know about the said fact, the complainant again requested the opposite parties to give the possession of the plot but the opposite party put the matter on hold on one pretext or another by saying that the matter was pending before the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh therefore, the possession shall be delivered after the decision of the Hon’ble High Court. The opposite parties failed to deliver the possession of the aforesaid residential plot to the complainant despite the fact that the complainant had paid the entire amount of Rs.72,34,700/- to the opposite parties. Due to non-delivery of possession of the allotted plot, the complainant could not take further steps for getting the site plan sanctioned and to start his construction within the stipulated period of three years.
4.     Hence, the complainant has filed the present consumer complaint before this Commission.
5.     The complaint has been resisted by the opposite party by filing written statement. Evidence was also filed by both the parties by way of affidavits.
6.     Heard the learned counsel for both the parties. Learned counsel for the complainant has stated that as per the agreement the period for giving the possession was for three years and therefore, the possession was to be delivered in the year 2014. However, the possession was not offered till the filing of the complaint. The complainant was kept in the dark and it was not informed by the opposite parties that there was a stay granted by the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh vide order dated 08.03.2011 wherein the parties were directed to maintain status quo regarding possession till further orders, however, this was not to give any right to the writ petitioners to raise any further construction. Though there was a status quo ordered by the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh on 08.03.2011, the opposite parties advertised the scheme which was to commence from 08.08.2011. The opposite parties also accepted the booking amount and issued the allotment letter dated 23.12.2011 which was received by the complainant. All these activities of the opposite parties were in violation of the order dated 08.03.2011 of the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh. When the complainant came to know about this fact, the complainant decided to withdraw from the scheme as the complainant did not want to engage himself in the litigation. Accordingly, the complainant made a request to the OPs for refund of the money. However, there was no response from the OPs. The OPs are claiming that the stay order was only in respect of a very small piece of land and not for the whole land. This is not correct as would be clear from the Hon’ble High Court’s order dated 08.03.2011. After the complaint was filed on 15.02.2016, the OPs allegedly offered the possession on 23.02.2016. The complainant did not take the possession as the complainant had already filed the complaint for refund of the amount as there was a huge delay in handing over the possession.
7.     It was argued by the learned counsel that the OPs have raised the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction for the present complaint. It was stated by the learned counsel that the total amount of Rs.72,34,700/- has been paid to the OPs and if the interest @ 18% per annum is added to this figure, it will definitely cross Rs.one crore and therefore, this Commission has the pecuniary jurisdiction to decide the present complaint.
8.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the OPs states that this Commission does not have the pecuniary jurisdiction to deal with the present complaint because the total consideration for the property is only Rs.63 lakh and if the amount of interest of Rs.25 lakh is added to this figure it does not cross Rs.one crore. The total amount of Rs.72,34,700/- cannot be considered to decide the pecuniary jurisdiction and this amount includes penalty and interest paid by the complainant as he was irregular in making the payment of instalments and therefore, he had paid interest as per the agreement. The learned counsel has also stated that as per the decision of the Larger Bench of this Commission in Consumer Case no.97 of 2016, Ambrish Kumar Shukla and Ors. Vs Ferrous Infrstructure Pvt. Ltd., decided on 07.10.2016 (NC)”, it is the consideration which is to be taken into account for deciding pecuniary jurisdiction. Further, the learned counsel for the OPs has stated that the stay was only for 85 maralas of land and not on the plot of the complainant therefore, the complainant was free to take the possession of the plot when offered. The Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana finally decided the matter on 22.12.2015 and after that a general resolution was passed by the Trust to proceed with the project and to give possession to the allottees. In this regard a public notice was issued that development work will start soon and possession may be taken by the allottees in January 2016. Apart from the public notice, individual letter of offer of possession was also sent to the complainant on 23.02.2016. The complainant, instead of taking the possession of the plot, filed a consumer complaint for refund of the paid amount. When the plot is ready and possession has been offered to the complainant, there is no justification for the complainant to seek refund of the amount paid. The amount has already been invested by the OPs in the development of the plot and the Trust does not have any spare money to refund to the complainant as the Trust is a non-profit organisation.
9.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined the material on record.   The OPs have raised the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction for dealing with the present complaint. It is seen that Rs.72,34,700/- has been paid to the OPs and the complainant has prayed in the complaint for refund of this amount. It is true that this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla and Ors. Vs Ferrous Infrstructure Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) has observed that consideration amount along with compensation demanded should be the basis for deciding the pecuniary jurisdiction of a consumer forum, however, if the amount is more than the consideration paid and the same is requested for refund in the complaint, this amount needs to be taken into consideration as actual order will be passed for refund of the paid amount only. This Commission in the case of RP No.1794 of 2017, M/s. Maharani of India Vs. Branch Manager, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., decided on 11.01.2018, (NC) has observed that for deciding the pecuniary jurisdiction, the amount paid along with 18% per annum interest should be taken to decide the pecuniary jurisdiction. Thus, if 18% interest per annum is added to the amount of Rs.72,34,700/- (from the respective deposits) the total figure will cross Rs.One crore, therefore, this Commission will have the pecuniary jurisdiction to decide the present complaint.
10.       The question whether stay was on the part of the land or on the whole land is immaterial because, the public notice wherein it has been stated that the development work will start soon and possession may be taken in January 2016 was issued for all the allottees. The plot of the complainant was also covered under the stay as no offer letter for possession was issued to the complainant before the date of order of the Hon’ble High Court. Even the individual letter of offer of possession was only issued on 23.02.2016.  The public notice clearly shows that before the order of the Hon’ble High Court, there was no development work going on in pursuance of the order dated 08.03.2011 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh. Therefore, there is force in the contention of the learned counsel for the complainant that the complainant wanted refund as he did not want to engage in any form of litigation as the land was in dispute.
11.   Moreover it is seen that the letter dated 23.02.2016 which is being called as offer letter for possession by the OPs is really not an offer letter of possession as it is only a letter of demand and to get the allotted plot demarcated as would be clear from the contents of this letter which reads as under:
“You were allotted the plot in the above noted Surya Enclave Extension. As you are that some of the land owners had filed a case in the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana in which they had obtained the stay on some portion of the acquired land because of which great difficulties were being faced to undertake the development works simultaneously. After the decision in favour of the Trust on 22.12.2015, the development works such as Roads, Water Supply and Sewerage are being carried out at a great speed. You are requested to come to the Trust Office and deposit the balance amount/ after the execution of the agreement, obtain the demarcation of your plot”.
12.   It is also true that once there was a status quo order dated 08.03.2011 from the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh, the scheme floated should have been stayed by the OPs, however, they accepted the booking amounts and also allotted plot numbers to different allottees. In fact, the further amounts were also received.
13.   In my view, these activities of the OPs amount to unfair trade practice and thus, deficiency in service on the part of the OPs is evident. Otherwise also, as possession was to be delivered in the year 2014 as per the scheme, however, the same was allegedly offered in February 2016. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.12238 of 2018 titled as “Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. versus Govindan Raghavan” has observed that if the possession is highly delayed, the complainant cannot be compelled to accept the property in question and the complainant has every right to seek refund. The order reads as follows:
“3.8. The National Commission vide Final Judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018 allowed the Consumer Complaint filed by the Respondent - Flat Purchaser, and held that since the last date stipulated for construction had expired about 3 years before the Occupancy Certificate was obtained, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession at such a belated stage. The grounds urged by the Appellant - Builder for delay in handing over possession were not justified, so as to deny awarding compensation to the Respondent - Flat Purchaser. The clauses in the Agreement were held to be wholly one - sided, unfair, and not binding on the Respondent - Flat Purchaser. 6 The Appellant - Builder was directed to refund Rs. 4,48,43,026/- i.e. the amount deposited by the Respondent - Flat Purchaser, along with Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. towards compensation.
9. We see no illegality in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Commission. The Appellant - Builder failed to fulfill his contractual obligation of obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and offering possession of the flat to the Respondent - Purchaser within the time stipulated in the Agreement, or within a reasonable time thereafter. The Respondent - Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession of the flat, even though it was offered almost 2 years after the grace period under the Agreement expired. During this period, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser had to service a loan that he had obtained for purchasing the flat, by paying Interest @10% to the Bank. In the meanwhile, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser also located an alternate property in Gurugram. In these circumstances, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser was entitled to be granted the relief prayed for i.e. refund of the entire amount deposited by him with Interest.
","10. The Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed, and the Final Judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission is affirmed.”
14.   From the above examination, it is clear that there is a delay in offering the possession and the land was also in dispute, therefore, the complainant is fully authorised to seek refund of his paid amount from the OPs. Now coming to the question of awarding of interest, it is seen that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd., vs Devasis Rudra – Civil Appeal no.3182 of 2019 – 2019 SCC online SC 438 decided on 25.03.2019, has reduced the rate of interest from 12% per annum granted by this Commission on the amount of refund to 9% per annum. Clearly, the amount paid by the complainant had been invested in the project and there was no whisper of refund even after paying the whole amount to the OPs and request for refund was moved for the first time in the year 2015. Moreover, the complaint has been filed after the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh decided the matter on 22.12.2015. Public notice was issued by the OPs, wherein it was informed that the possession would be ready by January 2016, therefore, the complainant must have been aware before filing of the complaint that the stay order has been vacated and the trust is ready to give possession of the plot, still the complainant sought refund of the amount paid to the OPs. It is true that the complainant is entitled to get refund as there has been delay of roughly two years in handing over the possession. However, he is entitled to interest only from next month from the date of last payment. Last payment was made on 19.12.2014, therefore, the complainant is entitled to get interest from 01.01.2015 in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
15.   Based on the above discussion, the complaint is allowed and the OPs are directed to refund the amount of Rs.72,34,700/- along with 9% per annum interest from 01.01.2015 till the actual payment.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Davesh Vashishtha, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA (ORAL)
The present Revision Petition under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) has been filed challenging the findings of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra, Circuit Bench at Kolhapur (for short “the State Commission”) dated 03.06.2019 in Appeal No.1049 of 2017 dismissing the Appeal of the Petitioner.  The said Appeal had been filed by the Petitioner against the order dated 11.05.2017 of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Kolhapur (for short “the District Forum”) allowing the Complaint No.91 of 2017 of the Respondent.
-2-
2)      The brief admitted facts of the case are that the Petitioner/Complainant is a resident of Kolhapur  and the Petitioner is a builder and developer by profession.  The Respondent had booked a flat No.305 situated on third floor in the project building of the Respondent.  He paid a sum of ₹62,531/- and ₹17,25,000/- through cheques drawn on Bank of Maharashtra, Kolhapur Branch vide receipt dated 11.12.2015 towards the booking of the said flat.  Some dispute arose between the parties in respect of sanction plan of the construction which was not as per the choice of the Complainant/Respondent.  The Complainant cancelled the booking transaction.  He asked the Petitioner through e-mails for refund of his booking amount.  Vide e-mail dated 11.02.2016, he was informed by the Petitioner that his booking had been cancelled and the refund amount had been credited to his bank account.  Despite that, the booking amount was not refunded by the Petitioner as agreed.  Thereafter, the Complaint was filed.  As per the order of the District Forum which is duly confirmed by the State Commission in the impugned order, a notice of the Complaint was served upon the Petitioner but the Petitioner did not contest the Complaint and did not file any written version and never appeared before the District Forum.  Relying on the material
-3-
before it, the District Forum allowed the Complaint and issued the following directions:
Complainants application is sanctioned partly
The complainants be refunded booking amount ₹17,83,531/- (Rupees Seventeen Lacs Eighty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Thirty One Only) by the Opposite Party.Also from the date of submission of application by the complainant, an interest @ 9% on the paid booking amount and application expenses ₹5,000/- be recovered from the Opposite Party and be refunded to the Complainant.
An amount of ₹15,000/- being mental harassment to the Complainant be recovered by the Opposite Party and be paid to the Complainant.
All the contents of above order should be executed on or before 45 days.
If within the prescribed time limit, the Opposite Party will be failed to execute above order, the Complainant is a right to take action against the Opposite Party under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, Section 25 and 26.
The true copies of order be made available to the parties herein at free of cost.”
3)      The Petitioner had challenged the territorial jurisdiction of the District Forum and also contended that the District Forum had acted wrongly while allowing the Complaint as the Directors were not joined as party to the Complaint and hence there was                        no proper service.  On these two grounds, the findings of the District Forum were challenged by the Petitioner.  The State Commission after hearing the Petitioner at length and considering
-4-
all documents on record and after re-appreciating and re-assessing all the evidences on record, dismissed the Appeal holding as under:
“Sum of ₹17,25,000/- towards payment of consideration of flat bearing no.305 situated in B Wing by Cheque no.060663 dated 07/12/2015 drawn on Bank of Maharashtra, Kolhapur branch and another payment in the sum of ₹62,531/- as advanced towards service tax in respect of flat no.305, B Wing in the project floated by Pinnacle Vastunirman Pvt. Ltd. As receipts in writing at Sr. No.47 dated 11/12/2015 and Sr.No.22 dated 11/12/2015 which indicate that the cheques were drawn on Bank of Maharashtra, Kolhapur Branch as were duly acknowledged on behalf of Opposite Party which were accepted as payment made towards advance consideration for flat no.305, Wing B and further more when the complaint was filed by the complainant, doctor couple residing at Kolhapur in the Kolhapur Consumer Forum, they had sought refund of their amount advanced together with interest @ 18% p.a. and costs of prosecuting the consumer complaint.  The complainant had explained that the transaction for booking was concluded at Kolhapur as amount advanced for booking was issued by cheques drawn upon Bank of Maharashtra, Kolhapur branch to explain the cause of action and jurisdiction in consumer complaint.  This consumer complaint was absolutely unopposed and ended in the order for refund advanced by the complainants by the impugned judgment and order.  No appeal has been filed on behalf of the complainants to show their interest within possession of flat no.305 situated in Wing B of building project constructed by the opponent.  Consumer complaint was decided ex-parte though opponent was duly served in the consumer complaint bearing no.CC/17/91.  That being so, there was acquiescence on the part of the opponent for institution of consumer complaint in Consumer For a as also payments advanced on behalf of the complainants towards consideration and service tax in respect of flat drawn on Bank of Maharashtra, Kolhapur Branch and duly acknowledged by the opponent indicate for filing of the consumer complaint cause of action occurred in the district where complainants reside though part of cause of action in respect of territorial jurisdiction does
-5-
occur in such cases where project is situated.  Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, though the complainants were interested in claiming refund of advance instead of flat for which booking amount was advanced and further more though judgment and order was decided ex-parte in respect of refund of amount advanced by the complainants.  Complainants did not file any appeal in respect of regaining possession of the flat no.305 situated in Wing B to the project.  That being so, case of the complainants came under the provision of Section 11(2)(b) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as well as in clause (c) as observed above.  Hence, as the appeal is without merit, it is dismissed with costs in the sum of ₹5,000/- in addition.
4)      This order is impugned before me in the Revision Petition.  Besides taking the contention raised before the State Commission, the Petitioner has taken an additional plea that the District Forum did not have the pecuniary jurisdiction.  It is submitted that the value of the subject flat was more than ₹20 Lakhs, i.e., about ₹63 lakhs and therefore, the Complaint ought to have been filed before the State Commission.  Reliance is placed on the findings of this Commission in “CC No.97 of 2016 -  Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. dated 7.10.2016”.   It is argued that findings of the State Commission on the point of District Forum having territorial jurisdiction is also contrary to the settled proposition of law.  It is also contended that they have been wrongly proceeded ex parte.
-6-
5)      I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of learned Counsel.
6)      The issues relating to the pecuniary jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction and proceeding the Petitioner ex parte are both questions of law and facts.  I have to consider whether the findings given by the Forum below are based on the facts which were produced before it.  It is apparent that the jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(1)(b) of the Act is very limited.  This Commission has no jurisdiction to re-appreciate and re-assess the evidences and then substitute its findings to that of the Forum below especially when there are concurrent findings of facts.  It has been so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2011) 11 SCC 269”:
“23.    Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said  power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums. The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts. This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National
-7-
Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed. It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two Fora”.
7)      Again in “Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286,” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated the same principle and has held as under:
“17.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
8)         In T.Ramalingeswara Rao  (Dead) Through L.Rs. and Ors. Vs. N.Madhava Rao and Ors. decided on 05.04.2019 passed in Civil Appeal No. 3408 of 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“12.     When the two Courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact against the Plaintiffs, which are based on appreciation of facts and evidence, in our view, such findings being concurrent in nature are binding on the High court. It is only when such findings are found to be against any provision of law or against the pleading or evidence or are found to be perverse, a case for interference may call for by the High Court in its second appellate jurisdiction.”
-8-
9)      Keeping in mind the authorities where the Petitioners were rightly proceeded ex parte by the District Forum, it is clear that in the Appeal there is no contention that the Petitioner which is a Private Limited Company were never served.  The plea taken is as under:
(c)        The Hon’ble Forum failed to appreciate the fact, that since Directors were not joined as party to the complaint, there was no proper service of notice and hence complaint should not have proceeded exparte.  Hence the judgment/order needs to be set aside.”
10)    This plea clearly shows that there is no contention that the Petitioner which is a juristic person was not served.  It is the law that a Private Limited Company is a legal entity and any Complaint or Suit is to be filed against the Company and not against its Directors.  Since there is no contention by the Petitioner that the Petitioner which is a Private Limited Company was never served, no fault can be found in the findings that the Petitioner was duly served of the notice of the Complaint.
11)    As regards the finding on territorial jurisdiction is concerned, the State Commission after perusing the evidence on record has concluded that the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of District Forum.
12)    Section 11 of the Act describes the jurisdiction as under:
-9-
11.    Jurisdiction of the District Forum.—(1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the District Forum shall have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the compensation, if any, claimed ''does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs.
(2)     A complaint shall be instituted in a District Forum within the local limits of whose jurisdiction,—
the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain, or…..”
13)    It, therefore, is clear that Complaint can also be filed at the place where the cause of action wholly or partly arises.  Since on the basis of the evidence, the State Commission has rightly concluded that the part of cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of Kolhapur District Forum, the findings cannot be found fault since learned Counsel has failed to show on the basis of evidence which was considered by the State Commission while reaching to this conclusion that such findings are perverse, i.e., are not based on the evidences on record or contrary to the evidence on record.
14)    As regards the argument of pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned, it has been raised for the first time before this Commission in the present Revision petition.  This shows that the Petitioner is not serious about his contention otherwise he should have raised it at the first opportunity i.e. before the State Commission in the Appeal as well.  Moreover, admittedly, in the
-10-
present case, there was no flat buyer agreement between the parties.  He only paid the booking amount and thereafter, before any agreement could be executed between them, dissatisfied with the promises, the Respondent/Complainant had cancelled the allotment.  It therefore is clear that since there was no agreement for the purchase of the flat and the cause of action only relates to the booking amount.  The pecuniary jurisdiction thus has to be considered on the basis of the said amount.  The findings of this Commission in the case of Ambrish Shukla are distinguishable because it relates to different set of facts.
15)    Reliance has been placed on HUDA vs. Vipan Kumar Kohli,, 1995 1 CPJ (NC) 235, where it has been held that the issue of inherent lack of jurisdiction can be taken at any stage.  It is a settled proposition of law that where the finding on the issue of jurisdiction depends on facts, such pleas ought to be taken at first instance.  Thus, in terms of Section 21 of the Civil Procedure Code, the objections relating to jurisdiction (pecuniary or territorial) ought to have been taken at the first opportunity.  First opportunity was before District Forum, where Petitioner chose to remain absent.  Also in appeal though the plea of territorial jurisdiction was raised, no plea relating to pecuniary jurisdiction is taken.
-11-
","16)    I found no illegality or infirmity in the concurrent findings of the Forum below.  The present Revision Petition has no merits and the same is dismissed in limine.

UETC- Singapore, the holding company of the UETC-Delhi, India Ltd., and four timber traders based in India entered into a sales contract whereby UETC- Singapore agreed to sell to the traders, at an agreed price, ‘Pyinkado Round Logs’ (PRL hereafter).  The sales contracts mandated that marine insurance for the India shipment had to be arranged by the seller at the seller’s cost.  The vessel, MV EDINA MARIA, carrying PRL from Yangon, Myanmar to Tuticorin, India, ran aground, in Indian territorial waters, and was abandoned, with cargo on board. This gave rise to insurance claims on the OP-United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (OP hereafter) by UETC-Delhi, the complainant herein.  The OP denied the insurance claims, hence this consumer complaint.
2.      Heard arguments on 17.10.2019 and 17.01.2020.
3.      Learned counsel for the complainant referred to one of the sales contracts, that between UETC-Singapore and M/s MM Saw Mills & Industries, Kerala dated 30.06.2005 (Part III- additional document submitted vide IA 17594/2018) and to the Bill of Lading ( Ann. C), to submit that 173.372 H.Tons of PRL was loaded on MV Edna Maria (vessel hereafter) per the sales contract, part of a total cargo of 993.442 HT (1120 logs). Marine insurance was to be arranged by the seller at the sellers cost. Accordingly, insurance premium was deposited by Shri Biju Abraham on behalf of UETC-Singapore with the OP per receipt dated 4.7.2005, and a specific voyage policy dated 4.7.2005, for journey from Yangon, Myanmar to Tuticorin Port, India, carrying PRL, favouring the assured, M/s MM Saw mills & Industries, was issued. Similarly, policies were issued in favour of the other Indian importers. All these policies are at Ann. D-colly. On 23.07.2005, the vessel ran aground in Indian territorial waters owing to rough weather.  The insured-consignees, vide letters dated 26.07.2005, intimated the OP about the incident; and vide letters dated 27.07.2005, intimated the OP about their irrevocably assigning their insurance policies to UETC-Delhi, the complainant (Ann. E & F-colly).  On 11.08.2005, the complainant wrote to Shaba Maritime Co., the owner of the vessel, giving them the particulars of insurance policies and informing them that the letter be treated as a provisional claim intimation for the loss of entire cargo valued at US $ 455,496.09 (Rs.2,00,41,828/-); on the same date, the complainant also addressed the OP requesting registration of its claim with respect to the cargo loss of Rs.2,00,41,828/- (Ann. G-colly).  Vide letter dated 25.10.2005, the complainant, informing that the vessel had been declared as “Constructive Total Loss”, requested OP to process the claim qua cargo on the vessel (Ann. J).  Vide letter dated 09.12.2005, a claim for Rs.2,00,41,828/- , due to non-delivery of the consignment, was submitted to the OP (Ann.-L).  Scansea services (Kerala), investigator/surveyors appointed by the OP submitted their report dated 15.12.2005 to the OP (Ann. OP-5).  On 5.1.2006, complainant addressed the OP requesting urgent settlement in order that their right of recovery from the vessel owners did not get diminished. On 06.01.2006, complainant issued a legal notice to the owners and managers of the vessel (Shahba Maritime Co., Delaware, USA; Petroland LCC, Sharjah, U.A.E; Chahaya Shipping & Trading Co., Singapore and Terra Nova Protection & Indemnity Agency, London) making a claim for the loss and also restraining their insurer from making any payment till this claim was settled (Ann. O).  However, vide letter dated 24.01.2006, OP repudiated the complainant’s insurance claim on frivolous grounds (Ann.-P).    Thereafter, some exchange of letters between the complaint and the OP took place. Finally,  the complainant issued a legal notice dated 24.1.2007 to the OP claiming Rs.5,00,41,828/- with 18% simple interest with effect from 24.1.2006, date of repudiation, on grounds of complete breach of contract and deficiency in service;  OP duly replied, denying the breach of contract and other allegations, vide letter of its advocate dated 30.01.2007 (Ann. X-colly).
4.      After narrating the facts, as above, learned counsel for complainant took up the issues involved. Qua privity of contract between the parties and locus standi to pursue this complaint, he pointed out that UETC- Singapore, being the shipper/seller, had deposited the premium with OP for marine insurance through its disclosed agent/representative, Biju Abraham, in India. It was on record that OP had acknowledged a letter dated 4.07.2005 from Biju Abraham wherein he had stated that he was the authorized agent for UETC-Singapore and that for the purpose of insurance of timber logs valued at approx. Rs.2.50 crore, he was making a deposit of Rs. 25,000/- with the OP (Ann.-OP2). Further, section 23 of Marine Insurance Act, 1963 provided that “a contract of marine insurance is deemed to be concluded when the proposal of the assured is accepted by the insurer, whether the policy be then issued or not; and for the purpose of showing when the proposal was accepted, reference may be made to the slip, covering note or other customary memorandum of the contract, although it be unstamped”  His argument was that having received the premium, the marine insurance contract stood concluded. Thereafter, policies were issued in favour of the Indian consignees, the ultimate buyers of the cargo. He then referred to section 52 of Marine Insurance Act, 1963 which provided that “(1) a marine policy may be transferred by assignment unless it contains terms expressly prohibiting assignment.  It may be assigned either before or after loss.”   Accordingly, the policies were assigned by the insured-consignees in favour of the complainant, UETC-Delhi. It followed that the complainant was thus entitled to institute the instant consumer complaint as it had beneficial interest in the lost/abandoned cargo and therefore fell within the definition of a ‘consumer’ under section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Counsel submitted that this settled the issue of whether the complainant had locus standi to pursue this consumer complaint.  Qua non-joinder of consignees in the complaint, he argued that since they had irrevocably assigned their policy in favour of the complainant, their impleadment was not necessary. Learned counsel concluded by drawing attention to para G of the consumer complaint and reiterated that since it had not been disputed by the OP that damage to the vessel and its cargo had been caused by the vessel having run aground, the liability of the OP to settle the claim of the complainant was immediate and absolute under the contracts of insurance.
5.  Learned counsel for the OP began by stating that a Singapore based company was sending consignment of logs to India which were stated to be insured through an agent in the names of buyers in India.  Remarkably, he submitted, policies were in favour of the Indian buyers, not the company sending the timber. Since this was so, contract(s) between the Indian buyer(s) and the sending company became important.  He argued that initially, the sales contract was on CIF basis.  He explained that CIF is a seller’s contract and the contract ends only when the goods reach the destination and payment is made. This is the reason why it is called CIF (cost, insurance, freight) contract.  He further explained that a C & F contract, on the other hand, is not a seller’s contract but a buyer’s contract.  In such a case, it is the buyer who has to pay the freight.  He argued that the impugned contracts were all seller’s contracts on CIF basis; if so, insurance taken in India on behalf of consignees was a case of pure and simple misrepresentation by Sh. Biju Abraham, acting on behalf of UETC-Singapore.
6.      He further argued that under a marine insurance policy, there has to be insurable interest which is then transferable by assignment. Insurable interest, he explained, is the risk of losing goods in the event of perils involved in the voyage or likely to be involved. In the instant case, the Indian consignees/buyers had no insurable interest in the cargo at the time the vessel ran aground. This was so because till the vessel reached the port of discharge and the cargo was taken over by them, they had no interest in the cargo, having not paid a penny till then. And this was so because these were all CIF contracts. Necessary implication is that UETC-Singapore could not have taken insurance on behalf of the Indian buyers, in the manner it purportedly did.
7.      He then drew attention to the letter of Mr. Biju Abraham to the OP dated 4.7.2005 (supra) referred to by the counsel for the complainant.  In this letter, it was clear that the policy was to be for insurance of the cargo being sent by UETC- Singapore from Yangon to Tuticorin by MV Edna Maria.  In other words, it was to be in favour of the Singapore based UETC.  However, the policy was obtained in the names of Indian buyers, and not in the name of the consignor, UETC, Singapore. When the peril occurred, the Indian buyers assigned these policies to another Indian company, UETC, Delhi, and not to the Singapore company who had the actual insurable interest. He argued that there was nothing on record to show that the Indian buyers had any insurable interest in the cargo.  This has been, he submitted, discussed in the surveyor’s report.
8.      Further, learned counsel for the OP argued that Shri Biju Abraham could not have bought insurance for a foreign company and any attempt to regularize this by having a certificate from RBI was of little avail.  He also submitted that the goods lying in the sea when the vessel had run aground were salvageable; however, no effort had been made by the insured to take any steps in this direction.
9.      He drew attention to Institute Cargo Clauses (A) (Ann. OP-4): clause 11.1 lays down that in order to recover under this insurance, the assured must have an insurable interest in the subject-matter insured at the time of the loss.  He submitted that section 7 of the Marine Insurance Act, 1963 has also defined insurable interest: (1)…every person has an insurable interest who is interested in a marine adventure; (2) In particular, a person is interested in a marine adventure where he stands in any legal or equitable relation to the adventure or to any insurable property at risk therein, in consequence of which he may benefit by the safety or due arrival of insurable property, or may be prejudiced by its loss,…  In the instant case, the counsel argued, the Indian buyers had no interest in the cargo till it reached them.
10.    Learned counsel elaborated that there were six insurance policies in the names of four Indian buyers of the cargo on the vessel when it ran aground. These policies were on CIF basis.  This put the risk with the exporter/ seller till delivery was made and payment defrayed by the indian buyer. Therefore, buyers’ interest would start only when goods were delivered. Before that, buyers had no interest and therefore, no insurable interest.  The argument was that if the goods were not to reach the Indian buyers, they would have lost nothing because they had paid nothing.  In such a case, however, the Indian buyers have assigned their ‘insurable interest’, which they did not have, to UETC-Delhi, whose holding company is UETC- Singapore. He pointed out that all the four Indian consignees had sent identical intimations dated 26.7.2007 to the OP regarding the vessel having run aground. All the four had also sent identical intimations dated 27.7.2005, to the OP to the effect that they had irrevocably assigned their policies to UETC, Delhi, the complainant.
11.    He then drew attention to the legal notice of the complainant received on 12.1.2007, and to the reply dated 30.01.2007 to this legal notice by the OP, standing by it’s decision to repudiate the claim (Ann. X- colly).  He submitted that this reply had explained in detail why the OP could not accept the claim as per extant law:  Mr. Biju Abraham had no authority to arrange for insurance cover on behalf of his foreign principal; the four Indian consignees insured had no insurable interest at all times and at the inception of the policy, and therefore, the question of assigning their interest to UETC-Delhi did not arise;  Mr. Biju Abraham had only disclosed the true state of affairs at the time of inception or prior to that when he bargained marine transit cover in respect of shipment in question.  Counsel referred to sections 7 and 53 of Marine Insurance Act, 1963 to emphasize that as per section 7, the Indian buyers had no insurable interest and therefore, under Section 53, they could not have assigned insurable interest they did not have.
12.    In a brief rebuttal, counsel for the complainant made a few points.  One, qua the complainant not making any attempt to salvage the cargo, he submitted that the same was not practicable as would also be clear from the surveyor’s report which clearly stated that there was no road facility near the grounded vessel so as to enable salvage by road. Two, regarding suppression of facts in respect of Mr. Biju Abraham, counsel denied the same and reiterated that in OP’s own letter dated 30.03.2006 (Ann. –R), it had been stated that it was not their allegation that Mr. Biju Abraham made representation to deceive them. Three, on the issue of CIF basis of the sales contract, he pointed out that sales contract showed the unit price as being on CIF basis.  Therefore, CIF was only the basis of valuation. Invoking a decision of the National Commission in the case of Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. M.S. Ajanta International, he pointed out that this would clearly show that over the issue of C & F v/s CIF, the OP was clearly at fault. He then referred to the insurance policies: pointing out that the basis of valuation was CIF, he argued that this was at the instance of the OP, and could not be now used against the complainant.  Drawing attention to complainant’s rejoinder, counsel submitted that it had been clearly explained therein that insurable interest existed in respect of the Indian buyers as well as the complainant company, and that it was the duty of the OP to have honoured the claim.
13.    Responding to the rebuttal, counsel for the OP pointed out that the case invoked by the learned counsel for the complainant was a case of C & F, not CIF. The instant case involved Indian buyers, if contract, insurable interest and assignment thereof.
14.    After hearing the learned counsels and carefully perusing the record, I am of the considered view that the complainant has not been able to establish it’s case that it was entitled to claim insurance for the lost cargo, on the basis of assignment of the insurance policies in the names of four Indian buyers, premia for which had been paid by UETC-Singapore, through their agent, Mr Biju Abraham.
15.    Admittedly, UETC-Singapore, the holding company of the complainant, UETC-Delhi, had sold timber to four Indian companies.  This was sent on a vessel, EDNA MARIA, from Myanmar to Tuticorin.  On way, the ship ran aground and had to be abandoned.  All the cargo on the ship was therefore lost.  All the four Indian buyers, through identical letters,  intimated the OP the incident (26.7.2005) and then assigned their insurance policies (27.7.2005)  to the complainant  who is now before this Commission claiming over Rs.5 crore for the value of cargo lost. These are the core admitted facts.
16.    Arguments advanced by the complainant are that the OP was intimated immediately. Surveyor was also appointed. However, the claim was repudiated, wrongly.  On the other hand, counsel for the OP has argued that the repudiation was justified since the sales contracts were on CIF basis. Under this, export was made at the seller’s risk, and insurance too had to be purchased by the seller. Therefore, there was no insurable interest of the Indian consignees/importers at the time the incident occurred. As such, the same could not have been assigned to the complainant.  Learned counsel for the complainant however held that there was insurable interest and in support thereof invoked an order of the National Commission in which the Indian insurance company had been held liable for paying the insured amount for goods stolen in transit from port of discharge, Dar-es-Salam, till it reached it’s final destination, Lusaka.  Counsel for the OP however felt that this citation was irrelevant, since the contract in the citation was on C & F basis and the insurance was on CIF basis; and it was the Indian seller which had taken insurance.
17.    In my considered view, the arrangements under which the entire transaction was seemingly carried out lends credence to OP’s stance that the present insurance claim of the complainant is not sustainable.  Admittedly, UETC Singapore was exporting timber to the four Indian buyers on CIF basis.  The consideration was to be paid only when the shipment reached the destination and delivery taken by the Indian buyers.  Insurance policy for the cargo and responsibility for the cargo including risk in the cargo was therefore with the seller till it reached Tuticorin. It is only after this that the Indian consignees’ interest in the cargo commenced. Since this never happened, as the ship did not reach Tuticorin, the Indian buyers’ insurable interest did not get created. If so, their assigning the insurance policy in favour of UETC-Delhi has no meaning. Quite clearly, since the Indian importer had not paid for the cargo, the question of them sustaining a loss on it being lost in transit cannot arise.  The loss was on account of the seller and ought to have been insured by the seller in it’s own name, not in the manner in which it came to be insured in the names of the Indian consignees. It is this aspect of the matter which has been discussed and debated at some length in the proceedings.  The clear conclusion, to my mind, is that the Indian companies, in whose names insurance policies had been issued, had no insurable interest at the time of the incident. Consequently, they could not have assigned what they did not have.
18. This leads to the question: how did the insurance policies come to be issued in the names of the Indian buyers? Per record, Mr Biju Abraham, vide a handwritten letter dated 4.7.2007, declaring himself to be the authorized agent of UETC-Singapore, deposited Rs. 25,000/- towards insurance of the timber cargo of Rs. 2.5 crore value. He also made it clear that details regarding cargo would be made available later for issuing policy certificate and in case of any claim, the payment was to be made to UETC-Singapore. This was duly receipted by OP, recording that it was deposit premium for marine cargo insurance from Yangon to Tuticorin by MV Edna Maria by consignee UETC-Singaore. Thus, what is clear is that in both the letter dated 4.7.2005 and the receipt dated 4.7.2005, the representation  was that premium was being paid for cargo of UETC-Singapore. However, the policies issued thereafter, all dated 4.7.2005, showed the Indian consignees as the assured parties. The act of declaring intent in the name of UETC-Singapore and thereafter having the policies issued in the names of Indian consignees did amount to misrepresentation by Mr. Abraham, one of the reasons cited by the OP for repudiating the claim. Be that as it may, it stands established that the entire contract was on CIF basis and the seller, UETC-Singapore therefore ought to have taken insurance for the cargo in it’s own name, and not in the names of the Indian buyers, adopting a circuitous route through Mr Biju Abraham.  OP therefore cannot be faulted for having repudiated the claim.
","19.    In view of the discussion above, this consumer complaint, after consideration, stands dismissed.  In the facts of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Vishnu Mehra, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Konark Tyagi, Advocate. 
","The complainant which is appellant in  FA No. 1578/2019 and respondent in FA No. 1647/2019 obtained an insurance policy from National Insurance Company Limited, appellant in FA No. 1647/2019 and respondent in FA No. 1578/2019 in respect of the stock kept in its cold storage for the period from 07.01.2005 to 06.01.2006.  A fire broke out in the premises of the complainant and stock stored therein is alleged to have been destroyed/damaged. A surveyor M/s S Sony & Co. was appointed by the insurer to assess the loss. The surveyor submitted a report assessing the loss. However, instead of making payment in terms of the report of the surveyor an investigator was appointed by the insurer namely M/s Royal Associates who submitted a report dated 22.08.2006. The investigator recorded several findings which need not be reproduced in this order.  The opinion given by them on the basis of their investigation reads as under:-
“On the basis of the investigations made and findings recorded above, we are of the considered opinion that the insured’s claim is not genuine and is an outcome of his long term planning to recover his losses from the insurers to neutralize the loan taken from the bank and from other government agencies.  Some of the acts committed by the insured were not only immortal but were illegal.  We submit this report based on the facts investigated by us, discussions held with various persons concerned with the cold storage in one way or the other and have put down the facts without bias for and against any of the parties concerned be it insurers of the insured.
We hope you will find the facts produced above useful for appropriately dealing with the insured’s claim strictly in the with the relevant policy of insurance.”
2.      The insurer repudiated the claim wide letter dated 22.01.2007 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
“We would like to draw your attention to two Condition No. 6 of the policy of  Insurance which categorically provides that in case the compliance of the said condition is not made the claim is not payable. The said condition reads as under:-
On the happening of any loss or damage the insured shell forthwith give notice thereof to the company and shall within 15 days after the loss or damage or such further time as the company may in writing allow in that behalf deliver to the company.
A claim in writing for the loss or damage containing as particular an (illegible) as may be reasonably practicable of all the several articles for items or property damaged or destroyed and of the amount of the loss or damage thereto respectively having regard to their value at the time of the loss or damage not including profit of any kind.
Particulars of father insurances, if any
The insured shall also at all times at his own expense produce procure and give to the company all such further particulars specification books purchase invoices duplicates or copies thereof documents investigation reports (internal/external) proof and information with respect to the claim and the origin and cause of the loos and the circumstances under which the loss or damage occurred and any matter touching the liability or the amount of the liability of the company as may be reasonably required by or on behalf of the company together with the declaration on oath or in other legal form of the truth of the claim and of any matters concerned therewith.
No claim under this policy shall be payable unless the terms of this condition have been complied with.
In no case whatsoever Shelby the company be liable for any loss or damage after the expiration of 12 months from the happening of the loss or damage unless the claim is the subject of pending action or arbitration; it being expressly agreed and declared that if the company shall disclaim liability for any claim hereunder and such claim shall not within 12 calendar months from the date of the disclaimer have been made the subject matter of a suit in a court of law then the claim shall for our purposes be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.
That apart your above said claim was also got investigated by an independent investigating agency as it was learnt from the other insurance companies who had also insured the property etc. of the cold storage in question that the investigations which were both carried out by them revealed that the claim was not genuine. The investigators are appointed by us had accordingly made enquiries at various sources including enquiries from you, your employees police station and the others traders whose stocks were also lying in the said cold storage. After discreet enquiry into the matter they submitted their report to the company along with the documentary evidence in support of their findings recording to the investigation report.
After examining the report of the said investigators and the documents collected by them in the process of their investigation we find that there are positive evidence which indicate that your claim is not genuine and it is an outcome of your plan to recover the (illegible) from the insurers to repay the various loans taken by you from different banks and other Financial Institutions. Your conduct at the initial stages of the fire was not that of a prudent insured in as much as there was a deliberate attempt on your part to ensure that the small (illegible) takes is serious turn by purposely delaying the fire fighting operations and prevent other traders to take out there stokes when the same could have been easily taken out. This would have not only save those stocks but would have also reduced the intensity of fire thereby reducing the possibility of the fire from spreading and damaging the complete contents and the cold storage building. Apart from this very records produced by you are manufactured/fabricated so as to exaggerate the claim. The investigations revealed that you had removed some stokes before the fire. Apparent discrepancies were found in the claim and no valid reason could be provided for the delay in informing the police authorities and the report which was made in a casual manner thus escaping from a proper investigation by the police authorities.
We would like to draw your attention to condition number 8 of the policy of insurance which reads as under:-
If the claim be in any respect fraudulent or if any false declaration be made or used in support thereof or I fany fraudulent means or devices are used by the insured or anyone acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under the policy or if the loss or damage be occasioned by the wilful act or with the convenience of the insured all benefits under the this policy shall be forfeited.
For the above said about reasons, we regret to inform you that your claim is hereby repudiated under the above said terms and conditions of the policy.”
3.      Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint. Vide impugned order dated 06.05.2019 the State Commission directed as under:-
Having regard to the discussion done and the legal position explained above, the appointment of the 2nd Surveyor, in the absence of any infirmity or irregularity alleged to have been made in the assessment made by the Surveyor is not appropriate. It appears that the appointment of the Investigator was only for suiting the convenience of the insurer. In these circumstances the repudiation of the claim preferred by the complainant is set aside being unjustified and in these circumstances ends of Justice would be met if a direction is issued to the insurer to settle the claim and make the payment keeping in view the assessment made by the Surveyor within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the certified copy of this order. No order as against the Bank is called for in the facts and circumstances of the case. Ordered accordingly.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission both the parties are before this Commission by way of these cross appeals.
5.      A careful perusal of the impugned order shows that the State Commission allowed the consumer complaint solely on the ground that the appointment of the investigator was illegal the same being in violation of section 64UM Insurance Act. The State Commission did not examine the matter own merits in the light of the report of the surveyor and the investigator.
6.      The Ld. counsel for the complainant contends that the appointment of the investigator was illegal. He also submits that the insurer appointed a second surveyor under the name of an investigator and the second server could not have been appointed except for cogent reasons. Reliance is placed upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in in Sri Venkateswara Syndicate v. Oriental Insurance Company Limited & Anr., (2009) 8 SCC 507 where the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:-
“32. There is no disputing the fact that the Surveyor/Surveyors are appointed by the Insurance Company under the provisions of Insurance Act and their reports are to be given due importance and one should have sufficient grounds not to agree with the assessment made by them. We also add, that, under this section the Insurance Company cannot go on appointing Surveyors one after another so as to get a tailor, made report to the satisfaction of the concerned officer of the Insurance Company, if for any reason, the report of the Surveyors is not acceptable, the insurer has to give valid reason for not accepting the report.
33. Scheme of Section 64-UM particularly, of Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) would show that the insurer cannot appoint a second surveyor  just as a matter of course. If for any valid reason the report of the Surveyor is not acceptable to the insurer may be for the reason if there are inherent defects, if it is found to be arbitrary, excessive, exaggerated etc., it must specify cogent reasons, without which it is not free to appoint second surveyor  or Surveyors till it gets a report which would satisfy its interest. Alternatively, it can be stated that there must be sufficient ground to disagree with the findings of Surveyor/Surveyors. There is no prohibition in the Insurance Act for appointment of second surveyor  by the Insurance Company, but while doing so, the Insurance Company has to give satisfactory reasons for not accepting the report of the first Surveyor and the need to appoint second surveyor.”
7.      Mr. Vishnu Mehra, Ld. counsel for the insurer, on the other hand, submits that the decision relied upon by the Ld. counsel for the complainant has no application to the matter since they have appointed an investigator and not a second surveyor.  The power of an insurer to appoint an investigator was upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in III (2005) CPJ 6 (SC) where the Hon’ble Supreme Court held as under:-
“5. One of the main defences attempted by the appellant was that the fire was not accidental and hence the appellant had no liability under the policy. The respondent- claimant met this plea by pointing out that the Surveyor had reported that the fire was caused by a short-circuit as pleaded by it. It is true that the Surveyor’s report supported the claim of the respondent herein. But the said report was also based on an investigation by the police, supporting a conclusion that the fire was caused by short-circuit of electricity. It is seen that there was a further police investigation and the Deputy Superintendent of Police R.S. Pura had reported that the earlier investigation was perfunctory, that the cause of the fire has to be properly investigated and in the circumstances a fresh investigation was called for. The appellant had engaged a private investigator to investigate and that agency had reported that the fire might not have been caused by short-circuit; that it could have been arson or a deliberate attempt to make an insurance claim; that the loss estimated could not have occurred considering the capacity of the godown and that the available materials in the custody of the police indicated that what was burned was paddy husk and not rice or paddy itself as claimed. The appellant argued before the Commission that in the light of this report, the Commission should decline jurisdiction and direct the claimant to go to a Civil Court to establish its claim. It was also argued that the report of the Surveyor could not be accepted in the circumstances, especially in view of the report of the Deputy Superintendent of Police. The claimant argued that the report of the private investigator could not be looked into in the light of Section 64 UM(c) of the Insurance Act, since there was nothing to show that the private investigator was licensed. The State Commission accepted the position canvassed for by the claimant and refused to look into the report of the private investigator. The High Court in appeal, also endorsed that position.
6. We are of the view that the State Commission should have given an opportunity to the appellant before us to prove the investigation report. Section 64UM of the Insurance Act cannot stand in the way of the Insurance Company in establishing that the claim was a fraud on the company, or that it was a case of deliberately causing a fire so as to lay the foundation for an insurance claim. Similarly, the Commission did not apply its mind to the aspect highlighted that the first police investigation was reported to be perfunctory and a fresh, proper investigation had been recommended. Similarly, the discrepancy in the capacity of the godown and the possibility that what was lost was only or mainly paddy husk, should have persuaded the Commission to make a proper inquiry before deciding to accept the Surveyor’s report in this case. The High Court, in our view, has failed to exercise its appellate jurisdiction properly. It failed to see that it had the duty as the Appellate Authority to satisfy itself that no fraud was involved and that the claim was genuine and sustainable. We are of the view that adequate prima facie material was available to warrant a proper inquiry on that question. In this situation, we are satisfied that interference is called for in this appeal.”
8.      In view of the legal proposition discussed hereinabove, the State Commission, in my opinion, ought to have examined the matter on merits in the light of the both the reports i.e. the report of the serveyor as well as the report of the investigator. That having not been done the matter needs to be remitted back to the State Commission to undertake the exercise. The impugned order is, therefore, set aside and the matter is remitted back to the State Commission to decide the complaint afresh in the light of the survey report as well as the report of the investigator and the documents produced by the parties.
9.      The parties shall appear before the State Commission on 28.08.2020. Considering the age of the case the State Commission shall decide the complaint fresh within six months of the parties appearing before it.

1.       Complainant No.2 is the Director of M/s Anushree Textiles Pvt. Ltd. and Proprietor of its division, Anuj Textiles, which prints and sells sarees in the brand name of “Anu.” It stocks all types of sarees and thans at their godown at 3, Cossipore Road, 1st Floor, Kolkata-700002. According to the Complainants, the Opposite Parties/Insurance Company insured their godown, alongwith goods, vide policy No.154400/11/09/00000831 for a sum of Rs.1.5 crores. Insurance policy was for the period from 26th March, 2010 to 25th March, 2011 mid-night. Fire broke out on 21.02.2011 at 8.00 am in the adjacent plastic factory due to which the godown of the Complainants was also affected. On informing the Fire Department, fire extinguishers reached the godown and extinguished the fire. Opposite Parties/Insurance Company was also informed of the fire. Opposite Parties appointed a surveyor, vide letter dated 22.02.2011, who inspected and assessed the loss due to fire. The surveyor checked several documents and sought clarifications from the Complainants which were duly replied. Final survey report was submitted on 10.05.2011 to settle the claim at Rs.1,42,50,000/-. Thereupon the Opposite Parties appointed an investigator, vide letter dated 31.01.2012, who assessed the loss on 14.03.2012 at Rs.59,16,024.92. The claim, however, was repudiated by the Opposite Party, vide letter dated 18.10.2012. According to the Complainants, the Opposite Parties, not depending on the surveyor’s/investigator’s report, simply to harass the Complainants did not settle the claim on one pretext or the other. Hence Complaint was filed before this Commission with the following prayer: -
“a)    In the premises above and in the interest of equity, it is therefore prayed that the Hon’ble Commission may be pleased to award a sum of Rs.1,42,50,000.00 as assessed by the appointed surveyor as settlement of the claim of the complainants and the Surveyor’s charges Rs.
b)      Interest from the date of fire till realization @ 15% on payment.
c)       Award compensation of Rs.50,000.00 for harassment and Mental torture caused to complainants.
d)      Advocate’s fees & cost as your Honour deem fit and proper.
e)       All payments to  be made within the one month from the date of the receipt of this Hon’ble National Commission order and as ordered by this Hon’ble Commission.”
2.       According to the Opposite Parties, a Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy was issued in the name of M/s Anuj Textiles to cover stock of sarees and textiles kept in the godown. The location of the stock was mentioned as “godown of M/s Tirupati Empore, 3, Cossipore Road, Kolkata.” The entire stock was reported damaged by the alleged fire accident which took place on 21.02.2011 at the adjacent plastic godown and spread to the godown of the insured. Surveyor was appointed, vide letter dated 22.02.2011, to survey and assess the loss. The surveyor, without considering the relevant factual position and documentation, vide report dated 10.05.2011, assessed the net loss at Rs.1,49,90,000/-. On close scrutiny of the survey report and documents like audit report, bank particulars, stock details, proof of insurable interest etc. ambiguity was found under the following heads: -
“a)    Ownership of location of risk (insured godown);
b)      Ownership of the premises in question;
c)       Insurable interest of the stock in question;
d)      Non-disclosure of facts and circumstances material to the risk (viz. non-disclosure of multiple occupancy of the location of risk);
e)       Ownership/proprietorship as per audit books and bank statement;
f)       Quantity of stocks damaged;
g)      Quantity of stocks recovered and salvage value and finally
h)      Net assessment of loss.”
3.       Despite clarifications sought by the Opposite Parties, the surveyor failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for the assessment made. The Opposite Parties, therefore, appointed an investigator, vide letter dated 31.01.2012, to look into the cause of loss, insurable interest, quantum of loss and genuineness of the claim. The investigator, vide report dated 14.03.2012, brought out gross violations of policy conditions as mentioned below: -
“a)    Location of Risk;
b)      Absence of insurable interest;
c)       No non-disclosure/misrepresentation of facts (multiple occupancy) material to risk;
d)      Right of subrogation.”
4.       In view of the aforesaid violations on the part of the Complainants the investigator assessed the loss to a tune of Rs.59,16,025/- on non-standard basis. He, however, left the decision of settlement of the claim to the Opposite Party. The Opposite Party, vide letter dated 18th October 2012, repudiated the claim of the Complainants on the following grounds: -
“a)    The Complainants could not establish their insurable interest on the materials allegedly destroyed by fire at 3, Cossipore Road, Kolkata;
b)      The Complainants have suppressed/misrepresented to the Opposite Party the facts and circumstances, material to the risk, such as the location of risk, nature of the location of the risk, multiple occupancy of the declared premises including the existence of plastic product manufacturing unit and oil mill at the declared premises which had the effect of enhancing the risk.
c)       The Complainants had not observed good faith and committed breach of warranties- both express and implied, under the subject policy.”
5.       It was submitted that the relevant terms and conditions contained in the policy have been violated by the Complainants, which read as follows: -
“General Condition No.1-THIS POLICY shall be voidable in the event of misrepresentation, mis-description or non-disclosure of any material particular.
General Condition No.6 (b)- The insured shall also at all times at his own expense produce, procure and give to the company all such further particulars, plans, specifications books, vouchers, invoices, duplicates or copies thereof, documents, investigation reports (internal/external), proofs and information with respect to the claim and the origin and clause of the loss and the circumstances under which the loss or damage occurred, and any matter touching the liability or the amount of the liability of the company as may be reasonably required by or on behalf of the company together with a declaration on oath or in other legal form of the truth of the claim and of any matters connected therewith.
General Condition No.8- If the claim be in any respect fraudulent, or if any false declaration be made, or used in support thereof or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the insured or anyone acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under the policy or if the loss or damage be associated by the willful act, or with the connivance of the insured, all benefits under the policy shall be forfeited.”
","6.       It was submitted that the claim was manipulated, fabricated and bogus. A contract of insurance is a contract of ubberima fides based on good faith. If the claim of the insured is fraud, it is sufficient ground to repudiate the claim. The Complaint is bad for non-joinder of parties as the owner of the location “3 Cossipore Road, Kolkata-700002”being Dalmia Laminates Ltd., a Public Limited Company and the proprietor of Shri Kesari Nandan Printing Works, being Mr. Robin Saraogi had not been made parties. In absence of the same, the Complaint deserved to be dismissed for non-joinder of parties. It was submitted that there were serious allegations of disputed ownership of location of risk and multiple occupancy which required detailed evidence both oral and documentary. It is a well settled principle of law that matters of complex nature requiring detailed and critical examination of the evidence and cross-examination cannot be dealt under the summary jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum. In view of the above, the present Consumer Complaint was not maintainable.
8.       Heard learned Counsels for the parties and carefully perused the record. Learned Counsel for the Complainants submitted that Opposite Parties were informed of the fire incident well in time and Opposite Parties also appointed their surveyor to assess the loss. The Surveyor assessed a loss to the tune of Rs.1,42,50,000/- Parties instead of paying the assessed amount to the Complainant, appointed an investigator who assessed the loss at Rs.59,16,024.92. Thereafter also Opposite Parties did not pay any amount to the Complainants and repudiated the insurance claim, in order to harass the Complainants. Based on these arguments, counsel for the Complainants submitted that the Complaint be allowed and Opposite Parties be directed to pay the amounts prayed in the Complaint.
9.       Learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties submitted that Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy was taken by the Complainants in the name of M/s Anujj Textiles to cover the stocks kept in godown of M/s Tirupati Empore, 3 Cossipore Road, Kolkata. In the investigation it was found that there was no entity in the name of M/s Tirupati Empore in the said location. It was also submitted that the claim of the Complainants was repudiated as Complainants violated important terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Complainants also failed to establish their insurable interest in the insurance policy. Complainants also supressed material facts such as location of risk, multiple occupancy of declared premises including existence of plastic product manufacturing unit and oil mill in the insured premises. It was also submitted that Complainants violated the principle of uberrima fides.  Therefore, the Insurance Company was perfectly justified in repudiating the claim. Learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties submitted that the Complaint be dismissed.
10.     Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy was taken by the Complainants from the Opposite Parties/Insurance Company in the name of M/s Anuj Textiles to cover stock of sarees and textile goods kept in the godown. The location of stock was mentioned as godown of M/s Tirupati Empore, 3, Cossipore Road, Kolkata. Entire stock was alleged to have been damaged by the fire accident which broke at 8.00 am on 21.02.2011 at the adjacent plastic godown and spread to the godown of the insured. The incident of fire was reported to the fire department as well as the Opposite Parties. The Opposite Parties appointed surveyor vide letter dated 22.02.2011, who inspected and assessed the loss caused due to fire. On 16th April, 2011 the Complainants submitted the fire claim form to the Opposite Party claiming an amount of Rs.1,66,91,694/-. Final survey report was submitted on 10.05.2011 to settle the claim of Rs.1,42,50,000/-. Not satisfied with the report of the surveyor an investigator was appointed, vide letter dated 31.01.2012. The investigator assessed the loss on 14.03.2012 at Rs.59,16,024.92. The report of the investigator pointed out several discrepancies and gross violations of the policy conditions, namely, (a) location of risk (b) absence of insurable interest (c) non-disclosure/misrepresentation of fact (multiple occupancy) material to risk (d) right of subrogation. The Fire and Special Perils Policy was subject to location clause. The premises and holding were owned by Dalmia Laminates Ltd. In the policy, the location was recorded as M/s Tirupati Emporium SCLP, 3 Cossipore Road, Kolkata 700002. However, on record M/s Kesari Nandan Printing Works existed at 3, Cossipore Road. This was a separate corporate body from Anuj Textiles. Existence of a company named M/s Tirupati Emporium was not authenticated. Kesari Nandan Printing Works was a trading unit as per the letter head. As per the bank audit’s report it was a factory undertaking packing & cutting jobs. As per trade license it was a non-food item unit for saree packing and cutting. The premises and holding was indeed a factory and not a godown having an electricity connection. The proprietor of Kesari Nandan Printing Press was Mr. Robin Saragoi whereas the proprietor of M/s Anuj Textiles was Mr. Narendra Saragoi. The location risk must confirm the address written in the policy. It may be seen from the above that the address where the stock was intended to be covered was recorded as godown of Tirupati Emporium SCLP whereas there was no such unit in the holding number which amounted to violation of the terms & conditions of the insurance policy. The location 3, Cossipore Road mentioned in the policy, the investigator clearly brought that the ground floor of premises was occupied by the plastic factory (Balaji Polypack) which had a wooden roof where Kesari Nandan Printing Works was located. The holding number had operations of two job works, namely, Shri Krishna Prints and Jitendra Prasad Polish Works. Their physical location was different and not affected by fire, as the name was not mentioned either in the fire brigade report or in the police report. The holding had another oil mill, namely, Tarakeswar Oil Mill as mentioned in the fire report. Rani Sati Hosiery unit was located in the mezzanine floor as shown in the police report which was found absent in the fire report. The insured did not inform the insurer about the multiple occupancy of the risk amounting to non-disclosure of material facts, which amounted to breach of location clause of the insurance policy.  As declared by the Complainants the location was shown as a godown whereas it was indeed a factory having an electricity connection, which the investigator stated was also confirmed by the insured. The most serious risk factor was the plastic factory and oil mill being located in the same premises at 3, Cossipore Road, which called for a higher basic rate due to increased risk. According to the investigator, though the fire first started in the plastic unit, the insured had not legally moved to protect the subrogation right of the insurer. The investigator went on to record that though the above violations can make a contract voidable, he left it to the option of the insurer to settle the claim on non-standard basis.
10.     As seen from the above, the policy was issued for a specific location with certain calculation of risk whereas the stock was located in another location having several other high risk causing units. The proprietors of the concerns were also different. No valid or credible material could be supplied, wherefrom it could be inferred that the goods which were destroyed by the fire at 3, Cossipore Road were owned by the Complainants. The Opposite Party/Insurance Company cited the bank audit’s report that the entire hypothecated stock at the portion occupied by Sri Kesari Nandan Printing Works at 3, Cossipore Road was shown to be of M/s Anushree Textiles Pvt. Ltd. and not of the Complainants and no insurable interest could be proved in the stock that got destroyed in the fire. The claim was, therefore, repudiated by the Opposite Party/Insurance Company vide their letter dated 18th October, 2012 as no claim. The claim was rightly repudiated due to misrepresentation/mis-declaration regarding the location risk as well as non-disclosure of facts and circumstances material to the risk as was clearly and elaborately brought out by the investigator. No entity called M/s Tirupati Emporium was located, as described in the location in the policy in the 3, Cossipore Road. No document could also be supplied by the Complainants to show the existence of M/s Tirupati Emporium operation from the premises shown in the policy document. After the fire, the Complainants declared that the material was stored in the godown of Sri Kesari Nandan Printing Works located in the first floor at 3, Cossipore Road. The proprietor of Sri Kesari Nandan Printing Works was other than the proprietor of the Complainant firm. The Complainants had no existence at 3, Cossipore Road, Kolkata and no evidence could be provided by the Complainants to show that the goods destroyed by the fire at 3, Cossipore Road were owned by the Complainants. In the bank audits report, the entire hypothecated stock in the portion occupied by Sri Kesari Nandan Printing Works at 3, Cossipore Road was shown to be of M/s Anushree Textiles Pvt. Ltd. The claim of the Complainants further suffers due to misrepresentation not only of the location of the risk, but also non-disclosure of the factum of multiple occupancy at the declared location i.e. the existence of plastic goods unit and oil mill etc. as also the increased risk due to location of several units dealing with highly combustible and inflammable materials like plastic and oil etc. By supressing the material information relating to the risk involved, the Complainants had rendered the contract of insurance void. There was breach of warranties and enhancement of risk by supressing and misrepresenting the facts.
11.     In view of the above discussion, I find that there is a gross violation, suppression and misrepresentation of material information regarding the location of the unit and the increased risk due to multiplicity of units in the same premises. The Opposite Parties/Insurance Company rightly repudiated the claim of the Complainant based on the detailed report of the investigator. The Complainants failed to establish any deficiency in service on the part of the Opposite Parties. I, therefore, find no merit in the Complaint and the same is hereby dismissed.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents had filed consumer complaints against the appellants which were allowed by the State Commission with a direction to the appellant to refund the amount received by them from the complainant along-with interest and compensation in terms of the said order.
2.      The order passed by the State Commission in the consumer complaint having not been complied the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of execution applications. In the execution proceedings the State Commission initially attached the bank account of the appellants.  The parties thereafter filed compromise applications before the State Commission containing the terms of the settlement arrived at between them and post-dated cheques in terms of the said settlement were given by the appellants to the complainants.  The said cheques, when presented, were dishonoured.  The State Commission while disposing of the execution applications as withdrawn/satisfied, had granted liberty to the complainants to get the said execution applications revived if any of the cheques was dishonoured.  It was also directed that if any of the cheques was dishonoured the appellant would be liable to pay Rs. 50,000/- for each bounced cheque and the said amount would be deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Account of the State Commission. It is the afore-said direction of the State Commission for payment of penalty @ Rs. 50,000/- for each dishonoured cheque which is under challenge in these appeals.
3.      The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that neither Section 25 nor Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, gives jurisdiction to the consumer fora to impose penalty of this nature. I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the appellant in this regard. In terms of Section 25(3) of the Consumer Protection Act, the State Commission can issue a recovery certificate to the concerned collector requiring him to recover the amount payable by the appellants to the complainants as arrears of land revenue. In terms of Section 27(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, the State Commission, in case of failure or omission of the appellants to comply with its order, can punish them to imprisonment which would not be less than one month but can exceed upto three years and/or can also impose fine which shall not been less than Rs. 2,000/- but can extend uoto Rs. 10,000/-. Therefore, the order of the State Commission to the extent penalty of Rs. 50,000/- on the  dishonour of each cheque was imposed upon the appellants cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside.
4.      It is, however, made clear that the complainants shall be entitled to seek enforcement of the order of the State Commission by issuance of a recovery certificate in terms of Section 25(3) of the Consumer Protection Act, if the said order has not been fully complied with.  The complainants shall also be entitled to seek punishment of the appellants in terms of Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, on account of the appellants having failed to, omit to comply with its order.  An offence punishable under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, is committed as soon as there is a failure or omission to comply with the order passed by a consumer forum.  A reference this regard can be made to the decision rendered by a Three-Member Bench of this Commission in EA/80/2016 Rajnish Kumar Rohtagi & Anr. Vs. M/s. Unitech Ltd. & Anr. & connected matters whereby the larger Bench interalia held as under:
(1)     A company, or a partnership firm, which fails or omits to comply with any order made by a District Forum, State Commission or National Commission, as the case may be, will be liable to the penalty prescribed in Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act.
","(2)     The date on which the order is passed by the District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be shall be deemed to be the date on which the offence under Section 27 of the C.P. Act is committed.  The said offence will be deemed to continue till the order passed by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission is complied in all respects.
5.      For the reasons stated hereinabove the appeals are allowed and the order of the State Commission to the extent of penalty of Rs 50,000/- for dishonour of each cheque was imposed upon the appellants is set aside.  It is made clear that the complainant shall be entitled to proceed against the appellants under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 if the appellants had failed or omitted to comply with the order of the State Commission.   The complainants shall also be entitled to seek enforcement of the compromise which they had entered into with the appellants, through the process of the State Commission.  The parties shall appear before the State Commission on the dates already fixed in the execution proceedings. They shall also be entitled to proceed u/s 25(3) of the C.P. Act, if the compromise has still not been honoured.  Since the order imposing penalty of Rs.50,000/- for dishonour of cheque has been set aside the second order of withholding the amount of penalty from out of the amount received through attachment of the bank account of the appellants is also set aside.  The appeals stand disposed of.

  For the Respondent      :For the Respondent No.1:   Mr. K.S.Rama Rao, Advocate

For the Respondent Nos.2 & 3:       Ex-parte 
","This appeal has been filed by the appellants M/s. Telco Construction Equipment Ltd. & Anr. against the order dated 20.01.2016  of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Andhra Pradesh (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in CC No.84/2013.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1/complainant purchased a BACKHOE LOADER construction equipment vehicle manufactured by Telco Construction Equipment Company Limited, appellants herein from the dealers respondents No.2 & 3 herein on 3.5.2011 for a sum of Rs.21,25,000/-.  Within a few days i.e. on 09.5.2011 the vehicle started giving trouble.  The defect was rectified by the service engineer of the dealer on the said day.  Within a short time on 26.5.2011, the engine failed and it was replaced by a new engine on 27.5.2011.  Notwithstanding the same, the vehicle was continuously giving trouble and the same was reported to the respondents No.3 & 4 on 13.6.2011, 19.7.2011 and 27.7.2011.  On 29.8.2011 defects were again noticed in the engine after the vehicle was used for some time.  It faced problems again on 20.10.2011 and on much persuasion, the same was rectified by the dealer.  The vehicle again gave trouble in the month of April, 2012 and it was attended by the dealer on 30.4.2012.  Likewise, the vehicle went on giving trouble in the month of May, 2012, and after it was found defective by the service engineer of the dealer i.e. respondent No.2 on 26.5.2012, on his advice, the complainant returned the vehicle to the respondent No.2.  The respondent No.2 received the vehicle on 3.6.2012 and the same has been in its custody ever since then.  The complainant, therefore, was convinced that he has been supplied a defective vehicle and since then he was not inclined to take back the vehicle.  He therefore, issued legal notice dated 27.6.2012 to opposite parties.  While respondent No.2 and 3 did not give any reply, appellants issued a reply through their counsel  on 4.7.2012 stating that the claim of the complainant/respondent No.1 was in  process and a detailed response would be sent after the details were received from the concerned officials.  But no further response came. Since there was no final response from any of the parties, he filed the complaint in question.  Respondents No.2 and 3 filed their version virtually admitting the facts relating to the purchase of the vehicle and the defects including the replacement of engine and the repairs effected to the vehicle from time to time as alleged by the complainant.  They, however, stated that the vehicle was fully repaired and was made  road-worthy and as such there was no deficiency in service on their part.  They further stated that they paid a sum of Rs.56,000/- to the complainant as compensation for keeping the vehicle idle for a period of 16 days during the repairs at Dharwad plant in Karnataka State.  They further stated that on noticing some more defects they sent the vehicle for repairs to Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.  Accordingly, after effecting repairs the complainant was informed through letter dated 19.6.2012 to take back the vehicle.  He was also informed that he would be paid compensation at Rs.3000/- per day during the repair period at Nellore.  Therefore, according to them, there is no deficiency on their part.  They further stated that the complainant is not a consumer and hence, the dispute in question is not maintainable.  The appellants also filed version.  While broadly admitting the defects complained by the complainant, they alleged that the defects were due to the improper handling and operation of the vehicle.  According to them, the problems had crept in because the machine was put to use in a haphazard manner by inexperienced person.  Their case is that the defects pointed out by the complainant were not manufacturing defects and the same were ordinary wear and tear defects.  They have further pleaded that the vehicle was made ready on 15.6.2012 and the complainant is entitled to take it back.  They have further stated that though the warranty expired, the vehicle was repaired without charging any amount and they offered to compensate the complainant for loss of earnings at Rs.3000/- per day from 3.6.2012 to 15.6.2012.  Therefore, according to them, there was no deficiency on their part.
3.      The State Commission vide its order dated 20.01.2016 passed the following order:-
“18.       In the result, the complaint is allowed in part as follows:
i)     opposite parties 3 and 4 jointly and severally shall refund to the complainant a sum of Rs.21,25,000/- paid towards the cost of the vehicle.
ii)    Opposite parties 1 to 4 jointly and severally shall pay to the complainant a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- towards compensation; and
iii)    Opposite parties 1 to 4 jointly and severally shall pay to the complainant a sum of Rs.5,000/- towards cost.
The order shall be complied with within three months from this date, in default, the aforementioned amount shall carry interest at 9% per annum from today till realization.”
4.      Hence the present appeal.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The respondent No.2 and 3 have been proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 15.11.2018. Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission failed to consider that the respondent No.1 was not a “consumer” as defined under the Act in as much as the machine in question was purchased for commercial purpose as the respondent No.1 was engaged in the business of construction on larger scale and hence the complaint could not and ought not to have been entertained.
6.      Learned counsel for the appellants further stated that the State Commission failed to appreciate that the “BACKHOLE LOADER” is a commercial machine used for construction purpose and the respondent No.1 except for a bare statement had not submitted any documents to establish that he had purchased the subject machine for earning his livelihood.  The State Commission had therefore clearly exceeded its jurisdiction and in view whereof the impugned order is per se illegal and liable to be quashed and set aside.
7.      Learned counsel for the appellants argued that the State Commission has grossly erred in holding the appellants herein responsible for the deficiency in service without considering the fact that there was gross misuse of the machine as the said machine was not being used by the respondent No.1 as per the specification, guidelines and procedure mentioned in the operation manual and was thus being used contrary to the terms and conditions set out in warranty clause.  Therefore, the alleged complaints in the machine arose wholly on the account of negligence and improper handling and maintenance of machine by the respondent No.1.
8.      Learned counsel for the appellants further argued that the State Commission has erred as the mandatory procedure prescribed under Section 13(1) (C) of the Act has not been followed.  It is submitted that it was incumbent on the State Commission to have directed that the machine be examined by an expert agency as has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Hon’ble Commission in several similar cases.
9.      Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission failed to consider the fact that the warranty attached to the machine is for a period of 1 year or 2000 hours of operation of the machine, whichever is earlier, and the same had expired and therefore, the appellants herein cannot be held liable for any service covered under the warranty which may have arisen after the expiry of the warranty period.  During the period of warranty the appellants herein have provided all the necessary services to the machine to the satisfaction of the complainant.
10.    Learned counsel for the appellants argued that the State Commission has failed to appreciate that admittedly on every occasion the service engineer of the appellants/respondents No.2 and 3 had attended to the alleged complaints/repairs promptly and to the satisfaction of the respondent No.1/complainant, including replacement of parts free of costs.  In fact admittedly a sum of Rs.56,000/- was paid to the respondent No.1/complainant for the alleged delay in giving back the vehicle after repairs which was received by the respondent No.1 without demur.
11.    Learned counsel for the appellants further stated that the State Commission grossly erred in directing the appellants to refund to the respondent No.1 a sum of Rs.21,25,000/- towards the cost of vehicle as also awarding a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- towards compensation along with cost to the tune of Rs.5000/-.
12.    On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 stated that the vehicle started giving trouble right from the very beginning and it was repaired many times by the opposite parties in their workshop.  Though the defects were removed temporarily each time, one or the other defect developed again and the vehicle was to be brought to the workshop again.  Manufacturing defect is clear from the fact that the opposite parties changed the engine of the vehicle within a month of its purchase.  Thus, the order of the State Commission is perfectly legal and justified in the facts and circumstances of the case.
13.    Learned counsel for the respondent No.1/complainant further stated that complainant is a consumer as the complainant had purchased the said machine for earning his livelihood. No proof has been filed by the opposite parties to prove that the complainant was earning livelihood from other sources.  It was further pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainant that it is wrong to say that the machine was wrongly handled or misused.  The machine was being used as per the instructions supplied when the machine was purchased. The machine is a construction equipment and has to be used in rough and tough conditions.  Learned counsel for the complainant also argued that there was no need of appointing any expert when the service engineer of the opposite party has himself found after inspection that the consumption of diesel was more as compared to the standard consumption.  The State Commission has observed the following:-
“14.          …  The service engineer, who inspected the vehicle found that engine was consuming more diesel.  He found that consumption was 6.5. liters per hour against the standards of 5.5. liters per hour.  Ex.A.8 discloses that the vehicle was again taken to the workshop on 29.5.2011 and the engine was replaced as it broke down on 29.5.2011 which is clear from Ex.A.17 intimation to the Transport Department.”
14.    The State Commission has also recorded different defects that developed in the machine in the following observations:-
14.  …“Among the defects, engine break down, mainframe crack, chassis crack, multiple cracks on the machine, boom crack are the major defects of the vehicle.  Admittedly, these defects were found to have cropped up within short intervals.  Therefore, these defects cannot be any stretch of imagination be considered as usual wear and tear defects.  It would be beyond comprehension to state that the defects of a vehicle whose engine had to be replaced within 27 days of the delivery and whose main frame and chassis developed cracks are not manufacturing defects.  The opposite parties 3 and 4 would make an effort to suggest that the defects were developed on account of the usage of the machine by inexperienced persons.  The said suggestion is without any basis.  Opposite parties 3 and 4 have not filed any material to prove the same..”
15.    Thus, the learned counsel for the complainant stated that the defects developed are within a short period and they can only be called as manufacturing defects when the engine was also replaced within one month of its purchase. Apart from the defects, the machine continued to give trouble one after the another and the complainant could not make use of the machine properly and suffered loss.
16.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
17.    Coming to the question of consumer, it is seen that the complainant purchased the machine by paying the amount of Rs.21.25,000/- to the opposite parties.  The complainant has alleged that the machine was purchased for earning livelihood by means of self-employment.  On the other hand, learned counsel for the appellants has stated that the machine was purchased for commercial use in the construction activity.  Hon’ble Supreme Court in Paramount Digital Color Lab & Ors. etc., Vs. Afga India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. etc. III (2018) CPJ 12 (SC)  has held the following:-
“13. Thus, in our considered opinion, each case ought to be judged based on the peculiar facts and circumstance of that case. Whether the assistance of someone is required to handle the machine, is a question of fact and necessity? Ultimately, if it is purely for a “commercial purpose” and not for “self-employment”, the complainant may not get the benefit of the Explanation to Section 2 (1)(d) of the Act. The buyers of the goods or commodities for “self-consumption” in economic activities in which they are engaged would be “consumers” as defined in the Act. Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show that the appellants wanted to use the machine in question for purposes other than “self-employment”.
Therefore, the point to be considered is whether the appellants have purchased the machine in question for “commercial purpose” or exclusively for the purposes of earning their livelihood by means of “self-employment”. There cannot be any dispute that the initial burden is on the appellants to prove that they fall within the definition of “consumer”. It is pertinent to mention that respondent No. 4, who is a contesting party, did not choose to file a counter affidavit before the State Commission. In other words, he did not deny any of the claims made by the appellants. None of the parties have led their evidence. Based on the material on record before the State Commission, it proceeded to decide on merits. As the litigation is being fought since 2006 in different Forums, we do not wish to remand the matter, particularly, when there is sufficient material available on record for arriving at the conclusion.”
18.    On the basis of the above observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Paramount Digital Color Lab & Ors. etc., Vs. Afga India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. etc. (supra), it can be said that even if no specific plea has been made in the complaint in respect of earning livelihood by means of self-employment, a complainant can be considered as consumer, if no other purpose has been given in the complaint and it would be accepted that the machine has been purchased for earning livelihood by means of self-employment.  The opposite parties have not filed any proof that the complainant may be having a fleet of such equipments/vehicles or that he was earning livelihood through other means. In this background, I do not find any substance in the objection of the appellants that the respondent No.1/complainant is not a consumer. Another important issue that has been raised in the appeal is regarding non-submission of an expert report. It is stated that as per Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the State Commission should have asked for an expert opinion before deciding the complaint.  Section 13(1)(c) reads as under:-
13.    Procedure on admission of complaint. — (1) The District Forum shall, on admission of a complaint, if it relates to any goods,—
(c)    where the complaint alleges a defect in the goods which cannot be determined without proper analysis or test of the goods, the District Forum shall obtain a sample of the goods from the complainant, seal it and authenticate it in the manner prescribed and refer the sample so sealed to the appropriate laboratory along with a direction that such laboratory make an analysis or test, whichever may be necessary, with a view to finding out whether such goods suffer from any defect alleged in the complaint or from any other defect and to report its findings thereon to the District Forum within a period of forty-five days of the receipt of the reference or within such extended period as may be granted by the District Forum;”
19.    From the wordings of Section 13(1)(c), it is implied that expert report is to be obtained when the defects in the goods cannot be determined without testing the goods.  In the present case, the State Commission seems to be satisfied that the defects were of such nature which could clearly determine deficiency on the part of the opposite parties, therefore, the State Commission did not ask for any expert opinion.  Moreover, if this was the stand of the opposite parties, they should have requested the State Commission to appoint an expert to inspect the vehicle, however, no such application seems to have been filed before the State Commission. Moreover, the defects in the machine were so explicit that there was no need to appoint any expert for deciding the deficiency in service. The defects seem to be quite serious in nature.  It is strengthened by the fact that engine of the vehicle has been replaced within one month of its purchase.  This and the other defects speak themselves that there were manufacturing defects in the vehicle. The allegation of misuse or wrong use of the machine cannot be accepted because the defects developed in a very short span of time.  In the circumstances when the defects were so loud and clear, there was no justification to keep the vehicle with the complainant as the complainant may not have been able to earn his livelihood by means of self-employment from this machine. Moreover, when any person purchases a new machine/vehicle, it is expected that the machine will work properly and even if the machine parts are replaced, it cannot give a satisfaction of a new machine.  The kinds of defects observed by the State Commission and the fact that the engine was replaced within one month from the date of purchase, the defects cannot be said to have developed by wear and tear or misuse or mishandling of the machine for which no substantial proof has been filed.  In these circumstances, the refund was only relief that could have been given to the complainant and the State Commission has done the same.  It is true that the vehicle remained with the complainant for about a year and therefore the total refund of the price of the vehicle may not be justified.  For the use during the period, in my view, atleast 10% of the cost needs to be deducted from the amount of refund.  Thus, the amount of Rs.19,12,500/- is required to be refunded by the opposite party.
","20.    It has also been objected by the learned counsel for the appellants that the State Commission has also ordered a compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to be paid to the complainant.  Clearly, the opposite parties have paid Rs.56,000/- as compensation for loss of employment during the period the vehicle remained with the opposite parties for repairs.  Lot of machine time has also gone waste due to frequent development of various defects and time taken in their repairs.  Moreover, the complainant had purchased new machine/vehicle, however he could not utilize the same as new machine and must have gone through a lot of mental agony and harassment, therefore, grant of compensation is justified.  Adjusting the amount already paid, the compensation amount is reduced from Rs.2,00,000/- to Rs.1,44,000/-.
21.    Based on the  above discussion, the First Appeal No.249 of 2016 is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission is modified to the extent that the appellants would be liable to refund Rs.19,12,500/- (rupees nineteen lakhs twelve thousand five hundred only), instead of Rs.21,25,000/- as mentioned in the order of the State Commission. This amount will be refunded along with interest @6% p.a. from the date of order of the State Commission i.e. 20.01.2016 till actual payment.  The amount of compensation awarded by the State Commission is reduced from Rs.2,00,000/- to Rs.1,44,000/- (rupees one lakh forty four thousand only).

  For the Respondent      :Mr Savinder Singh Gill, Advocate 
","An interim application has been filed by the respondent for getting possession as per the order of the State Commission subject to finalization of the main appeal filed by the opposite party. Learned counsel for the parties have been heard. Learned counsel for the appellant/ opposite party states that they have no objection in delivering the possession, however, they would request that the amount that has been deposited with the State Commission for getting the stay of the State Commission’s order be refunded to them. Learned counsel has further argued that the State Commission has granted 12% per annum interest from the date of due possession i.e., 30.04.2015 till the actual possession. It was mentioned by the learned counsel that they have offered the interim possession in the year 2013 and finally they have received the partial completion certificate on 12.09.2018. It was further stated that in a recent judgment by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Wg Cdr Arifur Rahman Khan  and Aleya Sultana and Ors. Vs DLF Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd., (now known as BEGUR OMR Homes Pvt., Ltd.,) and Ors in Civil Appeal no. 6239 of 2019 decided on 24.08.2020, the Apex Court has allowed only maximum 6% per annum interest for the delay in possession. Learned counsel has argued that at the most, interest can be paid till obtaining of the partial completion certificate.
2.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant has stated that even though the partial completion certificate was obtained on 12.09.2018, but the offer for possession was given to the complainant only on 01.05.2019,therefore, at least till that date interest is required to be paid. Learned counsel has further stated that before obtaining the completion certificate, there can be no interim offer of possession and therefore, even if the same was offered in 2013, that has no meaning.
3.     It was further argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court talks of full occupation / completion certificate, whereas in the present case, only partial completion certificate has been obtained.
","4.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. Both the parties agree that the complainant wants to take the possession and the opposite party wants to hand over the possession. Thus, there seems to be no hindrance in compliance of the order of the State Commission so far as it relates to delivery of possession. Both the parties also agree that the main question that is to be decided in the present appeal is in respect of compensation to be paid to the complainant which is in the form of interest. As the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Wg Cdr Arifur Rahman Khan and Aleya Sultana and Ors. Vs DLF Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd. (Supra) has clarified that in such case interest@ 6% per annum at the most can be granted to the allottee for the period of delay in handing over of the possession. Clearly, the order of the State Commission awarding 12% per annum interest cannot be sustained. Now the question only remains, till what time the interest can be granted. Clearly, the offer of interim possession cannot be issued before the partial completion certificate was obtained and thus, that offer was not a legal offer of possession. The possession offered only after the partial completion certificate is to be considered. Complainant may not have information about the date of obtaining occupancy certificate/ completion certificate by the opposite party, until the opposite party informs that the occupation certificate/ completion certificate has been obtained and offer of possession is issued. In the present case, possession was offered on 01.05.2019 and therefore, we are of the view that interest @ 6% per annum from the date of due possession till 30.04.2019, is payable to the complainant.
5.     Based on the above discussion, the appeal is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission is modified to the extent that interest @ 6% per annum will be paid on the amount paid by the complainant as mentioned in the order of the State Commission from the date of due possession i.e., 30.04.2015 till 30.04.2019. The possession should be offered within a period of eight weeks from today. Complainant shall pay the registration charges and any other outstanding dues, if any, as per the agreement before the time of possession. Both the parties will have the right to go for execution of this order.
6.     Learned counsel for the appellant states that the amount of Rs.40,25,370/- has been deposited with the State Commission as per the order of this Commission dated 31.10.2018. The interest as per this order be released to the respondent/ complainant by the State Commission and the remaining amount including the accrued interest on the deposited amount be released to the appellant.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Ankit Acharya, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Santosh Kumar, Advocate 
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Megharam Bidiasar against the order dated 12.10.2017 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Rajasthan (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.539/2017.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that wife of the petitioner/complainant took an insurance policy from the respondent Life Insurance Corporation for sum insured of Rs.2,00,000/- and policy period was 30 years from 28.12.2013 till 28.12.2043 and the insured expired on 29.08.2015. The complainant filed a complaint before the Insurance Company.  The Insurance Company appointed an investigator.  It was found that the date of birth mentioned in the proposal form was mentioned on the basis of a certificate given by school.  However, the certificate was found to be forged and therefore, the claim was not payable. The claim was thus repudiated and the petitioner/complainant filed consumer complaint bearing no.246/2017 before the District Forum challenging the repudiation.  The complaint was resisted by the respondents/opposite parties by filing the written statement.  It was stated that the certificate on which the date of birth was mentioned in the proposal form was found to be forged and therefore, the information given by the insured in the proposal form was not correct.  Hence, the claim was not payable.  The District Forum, however, allowed the claim and directed the respondents to pay Rs.2,00,000/- along with interest of 9% p.a. from the date of presentation of the complaint i.e. 07.10.2016.  The District Forum also awarded Rs.10,000/- as compensation for mental agony and Rs.5,000/- as litigation cost.  The respondent Insurance Company preferred appeal bearing no.539 of 2017 before the State Commission and State Commission allowed the appeal and quashed the order of the District Forum.  The State Commission also ordered to hold an inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C. for offence under Sections 193, 196, 197 and 198 of IPC against the petitioner and the concerned officers who issued the Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card.
3.      Hence, the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record.  The learned counsel for the petitioners stated that the date of birth given in the proposal form is 10.07.1992. The same date is also mentioned in the Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card issued by the Government.  It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that point no.5 of the claim inquiry report by the investigating officer of the Company clearly stated that the school certificate was forged by CLIA (the agent of the company). It was argued that the proposal form was filed by the agent as the insured could only make her signature as she was not literate.  The learned counsel further stated that it was true that the Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card were of the subsequent date to the death of the insured, but the insured had applied for Aadhar Card and  Bhamashah Card before her death. As per the acknowledgment slip, the insured applied for Bhamashah Card on 28.08.2015 and she applied for her Aadhar Card on 20.7.2015.  It was argued that these cards were received after her death though she had applied for these cards much earlier.  These cards also mention the date of birth as 10.07.1992. It was further argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that as per her Voter Identity Card which was issued to her on 07.06.2013, her date of birth was also 10.7.1992.  It was argued by the learned counsel that the proposal form was filled on 30.12.2013 and thus before taking the insurance policy, the insured already had her Voter Identity Card showing her date of birth as 10.07.1992 and the proposal form also mentions the date of birth as 10.07.1992.  The State Commission has not considered these facts and has passed wrong order for taking action under Section 340 Cr.P.C. against the petitioner and the officers who issued Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card.
5.      It was further stated by the learned counsel that no other date of birth has been suggested by the opposite parties on the basis of any other document.  When so many documents give the same date of birth, the date of birth cannot be doubted.
6.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents/Insurance Company stated that the date of birth in the proposal form has been given on the basis of her school certificate, wherein the date of birth of the insured has been certified as 10.07.1992.  It seems that all the documents/cards have been prepared on the basis of the school certificate only.  This school certificate has been found to be fake and forged by the investigator of the Insurance Company.  The complainant has not come out with the assertion that the school certificate is genuine and correct, rather, the complainant is relying on the fact that this school certificate was prepared by the agent of the Insurance Company and the proposal form was also filed by the agent of the Insurance Company.  It is an established principle of law that if the proposer has signed the proposal form, it would be deemed that the proposer has filled the proposal form. Once a person signs the proposal form, he takes all the responsibility for the contents of the documents.  Without connivance of the insured, the agent of the company would not be interested in forging a school certificate for date of birth.  The Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card have been obtained after the death of the insured, but the fact is that these cards may also have been obtained on the basis of the same certificate which has been found to be fake and forged.  Thus, the principle of utmost good faith has been completely breached by the insured and therefore, there is no question of payment of the insurance amount.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the parties and have examined the record.  There is a clear report of the investigator that the school certificate has been prepared by the CLIA who is relative of insured.  It is also not clear when the complainant or the insured were having Election Identity Card of the insured, which mentioned the date of birth as 10.7.1992 and the same was issued in June, 2013, why did the proposer not give it as proof of date of birth.  Inference that may be drawn is that the Election Identity Card may also have been prepared on the basis of the school certificate.  Surprisingly, this school certificate also does not bear any date of issue.  This certificate has been forged and therefore, all other documents also cannot be relied upon.  The fact is that the insured has filled under the column of “nature of age proof submitted” SLC which indicates that the school certificate was given as age proof and the same has been found to be forged.  Thus, the information given by the insured in the proposal form was based on a forged certificate and therefore, the insured clearly violated the principle of utmost good faith.  I also do not find any merit in the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the proposal form was filled by the agent.  In this regard, I am supported by the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. and anr. Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod, II (2019) CPJ 53 where the Apex Court has observed the following:-
“31    Finally, the argument of the respondent that the signatures of the assured on the form were taken without explaining the details cannot be accepted. A similar argument was correctly rejected in a decision of a Division Bench of the Mysore High Court in VK Srinivasa Setty v Messers Premier Life and General Insurance Co Ltd where it was held:
Now it is clear that a person who affixes his signature to a proposal which contains a statement which is not true, cannot ordinarily escape from the consequence arising therefrom by pleading that he chose to sign the proposal containing such statement without either reading or understanding it. That is because, in filling up the proposal form, the agent normally, ceases to act as agent of the insurer but becomes the agent of the insured and no agent can be assumed to have authority from the insurer to write the answers in the proposal form.
If an agent nevertheless does that, he becomes merely the amanuensis of the insured, and his knowledge of the untruth or inaccuracy of any statement contained in the form of proposal does not become the knowledge of the insurer. Further, apart from any question of imputed knowledge, the insured by signing that proposal adopts those answers and makes them his own and that would clearly be so, whether the insured signed the proposal without reading or understanding it, it being irrelevant to consider how the inaccuracy arose if he has contracted, as the plaintiff has done in this case that his written answers shall be accurate.”
8.      On the basis of the above discussion, I do not find any merit in the revision petition regarding the insurance claim of the complainant.  The State Commission has rightly rejected the claim of the complainant.
9.      In the background of the assertions made and documents filed by the complainant indicating that applications for Aadhar Card and Bhamashah Card were submitted to the concerned offices by the insured prior to her death, I do not find any justification for continuing with the inquiry ordered by the State Commission under Section 340 Cr.P.C.  Accordingly, this part of the order of the State Commission for initiating inquiry under Section 340 Cr.P.C is set aside.  However, the order of the State Commission rejecting the insurance claim of the complainant and setting aside the order of the District Forum is upheld.
","10.    The Revision Petition No.3605 of 2017 stands disposed of in terms of the above order.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Mr. Divyankar Pratap Singh and late Ms. Chandra Prabha Devi of Kasmanda Estates were the owners of some land in the city of Lucknow.  They entered into an agreement dated 29.12.1995 with M/s Consolidated Construction Company (hereinafter referred to as the builder) whereunder the builder was to construct a residential multi-storied complex on the afore-said land and the construction was to be shared between the owners and the builder in the ratio of 40% and 60% of the built-up area.
2.      The builder executed an agreement dated 31.07.2002 with Sh. Manoj Tahalani for sale of two residential flats in the above-referred complex to him for a consideration of Rs. 18,16,000/-.  As per the agreement flats No. 220 and 221 were to be sold to Mr. Manoj Tahalani and in case land owners wanted to retain these flats, flats No. 320 and 321 were to be made available to him.  It is an admitted position before me that flats No. 220 and 221 were not available for being provided to Mr. Manoj Tahalani and the builders later on agreed to provide flat No. 320 B in place of flat No. 321 which had been taken over by fire department.  As per the agreement dated 31.07.2002 payment of Rs. 4,50,000/- was made by Mr. Manoj Tahalani to the builders.  The builder also admitted a payment of Rs. 3,36,000/- made on 01.10.2002.  Some cash payments in addition to the above-referred payments are alleged by Mr. Manoj Tahalani to the builder, which have been disputed by the builder.  The allotment in favour of Mr. Manoj Tahalani, however, is alleged to have been cancelled  by the builder on 05.12.2003.  This is also the case of the builder that after cancelling the allotment made to Manoj Tahalani, they entered into an agreement with Mrs. Prabha Singh on 06.02.2004 and had later delivered possession of flat No. 320-B to her.
3.      A civil suit was instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani against the builder.  That suit was dismissed on the ground that the appropriate relief to be claimed would be for seeking specific performance of the agreement.  Mrs. Prabha Singh was not impleaded as  a party even to the civil suit and instead of filing a fresh civil suit for specific performance of the agreement Mr. Manoj Tahalani filed a consumer complaint without impleading Mrs. Prabha Singh as a party to the consumer complaint.  In the consumer complaint an application was filed by Mrs. Prabha Singh seeking impleadment on the ground that she was the allottee and was in possession of flat No. 320-B.  That application was dismissed by the District Forum which later on allowed the consumer complaint in favour of Mr. Manoj Tahalani in respect of both the flats i.e. flats No. 320 and 320-B.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, Mrs. Prabha Singh approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. The owners and builder also challenged the order passed by the District Forum.  Vide impugned order dated 25.02.2011 the State Commission set aside the order passed by the District Forum and directed possession of flat No. 320-B to be given to Mrs. Prabha Singh.  The possession of flat No. 320 was directed to be given to the complainant Mr. Manoj Tahalani, as was directed by the District Forum. Being aggrieved from the order so passed  by the State Commission the complainant Mr. Manoj Tahalani, the builder and the owner M/s Kasmanda Estates are before this Commission.
4.      Flat No. 401 in the above-referred project was agreed to be sold to Smt. Sheela Devi by way of agreement to sale dated 30.09.2002 and the same was registered on 07.10.2002.  As per the agreement to sale executed between the parties, a sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- had been paid by Smt. Sheela Devi by the time the agreement was executed.  Thereafter, an admitted payment of Rs. 6,50,000/- was made by her to the builder and she also claimed to have made some cash payments which the builder has disputed.  The allotment in favour of Smt. Sheela Devi was cancelled on 15.12.2003 on the ground that she had not made payment of the allotted flat.  Thereafter the above-referred flat No. 401 was allotted by the builder to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.  The possession of the flat, according to the builder, was delivered to Ramesh Chandra Mathur in December, 2004.  Of course, it was disputed by the complainant Smt. Sheela Devi.  A consumer complaint was then instituted by Smt. Sheela Devi before the concerned District Forum seeking possession of the allotted flat and for execution of the sale deed with possession.  Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur was not impleaded as party to the consumer complaint despite the fact that before instituting the consumer complaint Smt. Sheela Devi instituted a civil suit for injunction and even in that civil suit Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur was not impleaded as a party.  That civil suit was also dismissed by the civil court holding that the appropriate remedy would be to file a civil suit for specific performance. Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur filed an application seeking impleadment in the consumer complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi but the said application was dismissed by the District Forum.
5.      Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur also filed a consumer complaint in which Smt. Sheela Devi was not impleaded as a party.  The consumer complaint filed by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur is stated to be still pending. The pendency of the said consumer complaint is noted in the order of the State Commission.  The District Forum allowed the consumer complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi.  Feeling aggrieved Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur approached the State Commission by way of an appeal.  The builder also challenged the order passed by the District Forum. The State Commission allowed the appeals, set aside the orders of the District Forum and directed delivery of flat No. 401 to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur and also directed execution of the sale deed. Being aggrieved from the order of the State Commission Smt. Sheela Devi as well as land owner and the builder are before this Commission.
6.      It would thus be seen that one consumer complaint was instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani, one by Smt. Sheela Devi and one by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur. Sh. Manoj Tahalani did not implead Mrs. Prabha Singh who claims to be the subsequent allottee of the flat No. 320-B and the District Forum rejected her application for impleadment despite her claim that she was the subsequent allottee and was also in possession of flat No. 320- B. Similarly Smt. Sheela Devi also filed the consumer complaint without impleading Ramesh Chandra Mathur who claimed to be subsequent allottee of the flat No. 401 and who also claimed that the possession of the flat was with him.  The District Forum rejected his application for impleadment as well, despite his  averment and more importantly, despite the builder also taking the same stand that the above-referred flat No. 401 had been allotted by them to Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.   The same stand was taken by the builder as regards the flat No. 320-B which they alleged to have allotted to Smt. Prabha Singh.
7.      In my opinion, the District forum was wholly unjustified in rejecting the applications filed by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur and Mrs. Prabha Singh seeking impleadment in the consumer complaints.  The veracity of the averments made by them ought to have been tested by impleading them as parties and giving them an opportunity to prove those averments.  It is not as if they had sought impleadment without any basis at all.  The stand taken by them has also been confirmed by the builder.  A common stand was taken by the builder as regards the alleged allotment to Mrs. Prabha Singh and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur.  The District Forum ought to have impleaded both of them as parties to the consumer complaint. Mrs. Prabha Singh should have been impleaded in the complaint filed by Mr. Manoj Tahalani whereas Mr. Ramesh Chander Mathur should have been impleaded in the complaint filed by Smt. Sheela Devi.   In fact, all the counsel appearing before me are in agreement that the consumer complaint should be remitted back to the District Forum for being decided afresh after impleading Mrs. Prabha Singh in the consumer complaint instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur in the consumer complaint instituted by Mrs. Sheela Devi.  Similarly, if the consumer complaint instituted by Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur is pending, Mrs. Sheela Devi ought to be impleaded as a party too in that consumer complaint.
8.      In the facts and circumstances of these cases the impleadment of the alleged subsequent allottes/purchasers was essential, they being necessary party to the consumer complaint.  The State Commission, in my opinion, was not justified in setting aside the order passed by the District Forum and directing delivery of possession to Mrs. Prabha Singh and Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur along with execution of the sale deeds without impleading them as parties to the consumer complaints and without  testing veracity of their respective averments through the process of the District Forum, after giving opportunity to the contesting parties to lead their respective evidence. The contentious issues involved in these matters could not have been decided by the State Commission without impleading them as party to the consumer complaint and without having benefit of the evidence which the parties could produce in support of their respective case.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove all the final orders passed by the Fora below are set aside and the revision petitions are disposed of with the following directions with which the learned counsel for the parties are also in agreement:-
(a)     Ms. Prabha Singh will be impleaded as party in the consumer complaint instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani. An amended complaint shall be filed by Mr. Manoj Tahalani before the concerned District Forum within four weeks from today and reply by Ms. Prabha Singh to the said consumer complaint will be filed within next 30 days.
(b)     Similarly, an amended consumer complaint impleading legal representatives of Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur shall be filed by Mrs. Sheela Devi before the District Forum  within four weeks from today and the legal representatives of Mr. Ramesh Chandra Mathur will be entitled to file their written version within next 30 days.
(c)     In the consumer complaint instituted by late Sh. Ramesh Chandra Mathur, if the same is still pending, an amended consumer complaint will be filed impleading Smt. Sheela Devi as a party to the said consumer complaint within four weeks from today. Smt. Sheela Devi will be entitled to file her written version to the complaint in next 30 days.
(d)     The District Forum shall decide all the complaints i.e. the complaint instituted by Mr. Manoj Tahalani, complaint instituted by Mrs. Sheela Devi and complaint instituted by Late Ramesh Chandra Mathur, if pending, afresh after giving opportunity to all the parties to lead evidence in support of their respective cases.  The consumer complaints shall be decided afresh within six months  of the parties appearing before the District Forum.
(e)     The parties shall maintain status-quo as of today in respect of flat No. 320-B and flat No. 401.  They will not sell, assign or otherwise part with possession of the afore-said flats and shall not create any third-party interest therein. No construction in the above-referred flats shall be carried out by them.  The final order as regards the possession of the  above-referred flats shall be passed  by the District Forum while deciding the consumer complaint afresh in terms of this order.
(f)      The order passed by the Fora below in favour of Mr. Manoj Tahalani as regards the flat No. 320 is confirmed.
(g)     All pending applications stand disposed of.
10.    The parties shall appear before the concerned District forum on 28.08.2020.  Entire record of the both the Fora below be sent back to the concerned Forum.

","IA/7282/2016 (For substitution of LRs)
This is an application for bringing the legal representatives of deceased petitioner no.2 who expired on 04.05.2014 on record.  The applicants are widow and children of the deceased and therefore, are his Class-I Legal Heirs. Though there is a delay in seeking impleadment, the fact remains that there are more than one petitioners in these matters and the others are alive. One applicant Smt. Ujjwala Vasant Chitale expired in the meanwhile. Therefore, the delay is condoned and the other applicants are brought on record as the Legal Representatives of deceased petitioner no.2.  The application stands disposed of.  Amended memo of parties be filed.
RP NO. 469 OF 2012
The complainant executed an agreement with the petitioners for purchase of a shop in a building which the petitioners were to construct at Chiplun.  As per the sale agreement executed between the parties, the consideration was agreed at Rs.4,77,000/-.  As per the agreement, the complainant had paid Rs.1,68,000/- to the petitioners before its execution and the balance amount of Rs.3,09,000/- was payable in the following manner:
(i)
20% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of plinth within eight days.
(ii)
15% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of 1st slab within eight days.
(iii)
15% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of 2nd slab within eight days.
(iv)
15% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of 3rd slab within eight days.
(v)
15% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of brick work within eight days.
(vi)
10% of the remaining purchase price at the time of fitting and colour work, plastering & fixing of tiles is completed within eight days.
(vii)
08% of the remaining purchase price at the time of completion of electrical fitting, plumbing & sanitary fitting within eight days.
(viii)
02% of the remaining purchase price after the completion of shop being ready for possession.
2.      The complainant, after making initial payment of Rs.1,68,000/-, paid a sum of Rs.1,75,000/- to the petitioners by taking a loan.  His case is that the petitioners did not complete the construction which ought to have been completed within six months and did not give possession though he was ready to pay the balance amount of Rs.1,34,000/-.  The complainant therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioners which inter-alia stated in their reply that the work had been completed in the shop agreed to be sold to the complainant but since the complainant did not pay the balance sale consideration, the shop was kept under lock and key.
4.      The District Forum appointed a Court Commissioner to inspect the shop in question and since the area of the shop, as per the report of the Court Commissioner, was less than the area sold to the complainant, the District Forum directed the complainant to pay only a sum of Rs.10,207/- to the petitioners which was directed to give possession on receipt of the said amount.  The compensation amounting to Rs.25,000/- was also awarded to the complainant.
5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the petitioners approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 30.06.2011, the State Commission partly allowed the appeal and directed the petitioners to give possession and execute the Sale Deed on the complainant paying the balance amount of Rs.1,34,000/-.  The compensation was also set aside by the State Commission.  Still dissatisfied, the petitioners are before this Commission.  The complainant has not challenged the order.
6.      The only plea taken by the petitioners in their written version is that they had constructed ten shops in the building including the shop sold to the complainant, but he had failed to pay the balance sale consideration and he was asked in May 2008 to take possession but he declined saying that he did not have money to take possession.
7.      As noted earlier, the balance payment was to be made in installments linked with construction.  Admittedly, after making initial payment of Rs.1,68,000/-, the complainant paid Rs.1,75,000/- to the petitioners by taking loan.  The petitioners have placed on record a letter purporting to be sent to the complainant asking him to pay the balance amount of Rs.3,09,000/-.  The aforesaid letter is not dated and there is no proof of the petitioners having actually delivered that letter to the complainant.  But it appears from the written version filed by the petitioner that the said letter was allegedly sent before the complainant paid Rs.1,75,000/- to them after taking loan from the bank.  There is no evidence or even allegation of the petitioners having sent any other demand letter to the complainant at any point of time.  Though it is alleged that in May 2008, possession was offered to the complainant, there is no evidence of such possession having been offered in May 2008.  In fact, the petitioners themselves have stated in the written version that when they demanded Rs.3,09,000/- from the complainant, they said that the work only worth Rs.2,31,750/- was complete and therefore, only that much amount should be payable by him to the petitioners.  Thus, it is evident that the work was not complete when Rs.3,09,000/- were allegedly demanded by the petitioners from the complainant.  The alleged demand of Rs.3,09,000/- without building the shop was illegal and the complainant was not bound to make payment in terms of the said alleged demand.  As noted earlier, there is no evidence of the balance amount having been demanded from the complainant after completing the construction.  Therefore, the complainant had no occasion to make the balance payment of Rs.1,34,000/- which, according to him, he has always been ready and willing to pay.
8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, I have no hesitation in confirming the view taken by the State Commission and accordingly, hold that the petitioner has to deliver possession of the shop to the complainant and execute the Sale Deed in his favour on receipt of the balance amount of Rs.1,34,000/- as per the order of the State Commission.  I therefore, find no merit in the Revision Petition.
9.      The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the entire building of which this shop formed part has since been sold by the bank under SARFAESI Act and therefore, the petitioners are not in a position to deliver possession of the shop to the complainant though they have challenged the proceedings initiated by the bank under SARFAESI Act.  This aspect of the matter has to be examined by the District Forum in execution proceedings, since the alleged sale is stated to have been happened after filing of this Revision Petition but the said development has never been brought on record.
","10.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the Revision Petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

","Heard the learned counsel for both the parties.
Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the main ground for the revision petition is that the interest has been granted by the District Forum from the date of filing of the complaint whereas the entire amount was deposited in the year 2008 and the complaint was filed in the year 2016. Generally when the amount is refunded, the interest is granted from the date of deposit till the actual payment. Learned counsel for the respondent states that the bank draft was sent, however, the draft has not yet been encashed. He further states that on several occasions efforts were made to deliver the possession of the parking space, however, when the learned counsel for the OP was  asked whether they are ready to hand over the parking space now, the learned counsel for the respondent has denied the same. In these circumstances, refund with interest is the only solution.
","I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record.  It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner had paid the amount on 30.04.2008 whereas the learned counsel for the respondent states that the amount has been paid on 30.05.2008. Without going into this difference, it is clear that the interest was required to be paid while refunding the total amount from the date of deposit. Accordingly, in the facts and circumstances of the case, I deem it appropriate to modify the order of the State Commission that interest on Rs.60,000/- will be paid from 30.05.2008 till the actual payment. With this modification, the order of the State Commission is upheld. The petitioner/ complainant will return the bank draft to the opposite party and the opposite party will hand over a new bank draft as per this order. The order be complied within 45 days from today. With these observations, the revision petition no. 1196 of 2019 is disposed of.
Order be given Dasti to both the parties.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Ritesh Khare, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition is directed against the order of the State Commission dated 17.9.2019 whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner came to be dismissed in default, no one having appeared for the petitioner/complainant before the State Commission on that date.
2.      Since no one was present for the respondent on the date the appeal was dismissed,  there is no necessity of issuing notice to the respondent.
","3.      The case of the complainant/petitioner is that on 25.2.2019 when the appeal was listed before the State Commission, his counsel was unable to appear and the next date of hearing was noted by the clerk of the counsel who was present at that time. Though the next date of hearing was 17.9.2019, it was wrongly noted by the counsel as 17.10.2019. As a result, neither the petitioner / complainant nor the Counsel could appear on 17.9.2019 and the appeal got dismissed in default on that date.
4.      Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case including the ground given in the revision petition, the impugned order is set aside and the appeal preferred by the petitioner is restored to the file of the State Commission, subject to deposit of Rs.10,000/- as cost with the Legal Aid Account of the concerned State Commission before the next date of hearing. The petitioner shall appear before State Commission on 15.4.2020. On that date, the State Commission shall proceed with the appeal preferred by the petitioner in accordance with law. The revision petition stands disposed of.

4.      The insured died on 06.10.2010. Her son Narender Kumar, the petitioner filed insurance claim for all the policies with necessary claim papers. It was alleged that OPs repudiated the claim without any sufficient reason. Being aggrieved, the complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum, Narnaul.
5.      The opposite party LIC in its written statement submitted that at the time of obtaining insurance policies the insured had concealed a material fact. She was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and underwent Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR ) surgery in 2003.
6.      The District Forum, after hearing the parties, allowed the complaint.
7.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 separate appeals before the State Commission.
","8.      The State Commission allowed all the appeals with a common Order dated 12.04.2016 because the question of facts and law involved was identical and consequently dismissed all the complaints.
9.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 revision petitions before this Commission under section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
10.    Heard the learned counsel for both sides. Perused the entire material on record.
11.    The State Commission clearly observed in paras 10, 16 and 21 of its Order dated 12.04.2016 that the insured suppressed the material facts while filling the proposal form. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as below:
10.  LIC also sought the opinion of Dr. R.R. Kasiwal. It has been certified by Dr. Kasliwal vide Exhibit R – 7 that earlier the patient (insured ) was admitted in the hospital on September 22nd, 2010 and was discharged on 27th 2010. In column No. 4, the nature of ailment has been mentioned “breathlessness, RHD, Post MVR (2003) Severe TR”. From these two documents (Exhibit R- 6 & R-7), it is clear that the insured was a patient of Rheumatic Heart Disease and Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) was performed in 2003.
­- - - -
16.     On the aforesaid facts and principle enunciated, the right to claim insurance benefits by the complainants does not survive in view of the medical record, that is, Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R. Kasliwal. Thus, it stands established to the hilt that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the Insurance Policies and she suppressed this fact in her statements (proposal forms) made at the time of purchasing the insurance policies.
- - - -
21. In the case in hand, LIC has proved by leading cogent evidence consisting of Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R Kasliwal, Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the insurance policies. So, the authorities referred to above are no help to the complainants.
- - -
12.    Thus it is apparent that the insured was a known case of RHD and underwent MVR surgery before obtaining the policy. She had not disclosed the information about her treatment in the proposal form at column no. 11. Thus it was a material suppression of facts which is not acceptable in a contract of insurance, which is a contract in good faith, uberrima fides.
13.    Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Commission have held in several cases about the concealment of material information. In the case of Modern Insulators Ltd. Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2000) 2 SCC 734, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
It is the fundamental principle of insurance law that utmost good faith must be observed by the contracting parties and the good faith forbids either party from non-disclosure of the facts which the parties know. ………
14.    We have perused the written version filed by the LIC of India before the District Forum. It is pertinent to note that in its written version, the stand taken by the LIC of India (OP) was as below:
The opp. Parties are not liable for making any payment to the complainant under the above said policies. Therefore keeping in the view the above said facts the complainant is not entitled to get any relief. The decision dated 01.08.2011 passed by the Sr. Divisional Manager is according to law and facts and is in favour of principle of natural justice and falls within definition of self speaking decision, hence the claim of the complainant was rightly repudiated by the competent authority as per terms and conditions of the policy and admitted the liability to refund the 90% of first premium paid under the policy. The complainant has concealed the real material facts before the Hon’ble consumer forum and misleading the Hon’ble forum by presenting wrong facts. Hence the complainant is not entitled to any relief as claimed in the complaint.
(emphasis supplied)
15.    We find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned and needs more interference and the same is affirmed.  There is no merit in the revision petitions and the same are dismissed.
16.    In reference to paragraph no. 14, we note that the deceased insured had paid certain amount(s) towards first premium(s) in every policy. Therefore, the LIC of India shall refund 90% of the first premium amount in respect of each policy paid by the insured as admitted by the LIC of India in its written statement. The refund may be ensured within four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this Order, else it will carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment.
With this direction all the revision petitions are disposed of.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
17.    Heard the Petitioner in person and the learned Counsel for the Respondent. Perused the material on record.
18.    In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Petitioner, to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing these 09 Revision Petitions is condoned.
19.    The short point in this matter is that one Smt. Laxmi Devi, the insured, the mother of one Mr. Narendra Kumar Jain, the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, had purchased 09 life insurance policies from the LIC, the Opposite Party, the Respondent herein, in which the Complainant was the nominee.
The dates of commencement of the policies were 28.12.2008 (04 policies) and 01.01.2009 (05 policies).
The insured expired on 06.10.2010, i.e. within two years of commencement of the policies.
The LIC repudiated the claim on the ground that the insured was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and had undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, this fact was not disclosed in the proposal form / personal statement, the insured made deliberate incorrect statements and withheld correct information regarding her health. As such the LIC repudiated the said 09 claims, but admitted to its liability to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions.
As evident from its written version, the LIC took the same stand before the District Forum, that the claims were repudiated for deliberate incorrect statements and withholding correct information regarding her health by the insured but 90% of the first premium paid in each policy would be refunded as per the policy conditions.
20.    The District Forum had allowed the Complaints.
The State Commission, in appeal, has dismissed the Complaints, inter alia observing that “12.  In the proposal forms, the insured stated that her usual state of health was good and she never suffered from any heart disease, liver, stomach etc. Thus, from the evidence available on record, it is established that insured had concealed the material fact with regard to her health.”.
21.    An insurance contract has to be in utmost good faith, by both sides. And in a life insurance contract, existence of pre-existing disease / health condition is a material question, necessarily required to be answered truthfully.
22.    In the instant matter, the insured, while taking multiple (09) life insurance policies, suppressed the (pre-) existence of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and of having undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, which were material facts.
The appraisal made by the State Commission conclusively determines willful and intentional suppression of material facts.
And there is no mitigating factor. It is reasonable and appropriate to say that
the insured knew what she was signing, she knew the significance of the
information being supplied by her.
23.    The State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
24.    It goes without saying that the LIC would be duty-bound to comply with its affirmation to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions. If the said refund has not already made in respect of each policy, it shall be made within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order, failing which the said amount(s) shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment(s).
25.    Disposed.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      The present Revision Petition is against the impugned order dated 05.07.2017 of the Chhattisgarh State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, (hereinafter “State Commission”) in Appeal No. 14/2017, where the appeal was dismissed and the order of the District Forum was upheld.
2.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the case are that the complainant took a single phase connection from the OPs. The bills were paid regularly by the complainant. On 20.05.2014, one bill of Rs. 7,440/- was received by the complainant. The complainant approached the office of the OP for the high amount mentioned in the bill, and the bill amount was reduced to Rs. 6,010/- and the complainant was directed by OP vide notice dated 16.01.2015 to pay the arrears within two days and threatened for the connection in case of failure.  Being aggrieved by the excessive quantum of bill, the complaint appealed District Forum and filed a complaint.
3.      The OPs in their written version submitted that the complainant did not take a single phase connection but took a regular electricity connection. She was using TV, fridge, cooler, fan, CFL Bulb  and the total load was 1190 volts. The actual reading of electricity consumption was concealed by the complainant in connivance with the meter reader. As per her will, the electricity bills were paid by her.  On knowing about such misdeed of the complainant, a bill of Rs. 7,440/- was issued to the complainant on 07.05.2014 on the basis of actual consumption. Thereafter, the complainant approached the OP who sympathetically dealt with the matter and the consolidated unit rebate was adjusted and the bill was reduced to Rs. 6,010/- from Rs. 7,440/-. Even though, complainant failed to make payment of the reduced amount, therefore, she herself was responsible for disconnection of electricity supply.
4.      The District Forum heard both sides, appraised the evidence and vide its Order dated 04.11.2016 dismissed the complaint. It observed as follows:
9. It has not been stated by the complainant in her complaint that she had made the payment of bill amended by the respondents, however she has stated that she was never issued the bill of such a big amount in past, but she has not submitted any evidence or certificate to show that the electricity bill issued by the respondents is much higher than actual meter reading, however she was in a position to submit the photograph of actual meter reading before the court to prove the said fact.
10. Therefore , in view of the circumstances of the case , it is clear that the applicant in connivance with the meter reader concealed the actual reading of consumption of electricity and got entered the reading of her choice and made the payment of electricity bills accordingly and when after learning about this , on 07.05.2014 respondents issued the Bill on the basis of actual meter reading of 1414 , applicant filed the present complaint on the grounds of deficiency in service , which is not acceptable. Therefore, we reach on the conclusion that complaint of the applicant is devoid of merits. Therefore, the complaint is dismissed.
(para 9 and 10 of the District Forum’s Order)
(as per the translated copy furnished by the petitioner)
","5.  The complainant appealed in the State Commission which vide its Order dated 05.07.2017 dismissed the complaint. It observed as follows:
14.  This is clear on perusal of the documents and evidence produced in the case that the appellant/ complainant has not made payment till today of the of the amended electricity bill of Rs. 6,010/- (Rupees six thousand ten only) to the respondents/non-applicants. The appellant/complainant has not produced any receipt of payment of this amended electricity bill in the case, however, it was the duty of the appellant/complainant that if she had the objection of the electricity bill given by the respondents/ non- applicants, the appellant / complainant had paid the electricity bill under protest and after that, she had instituted complaint against the respondents/non-applicants. When the appellant/complainant has not made payment of the electricity bill itself, then how she underwent mental agony and when the appellant/ complainant did not undergo mental agony itself, the appellant / complainant is not entitled to get mental compensation, as well as, it is not possible also to make disposal of the case on merits for want of payment of electricity bill.
15.  However, the District Forum has not considered on the complaint of the appellant/ complainant on the above point and has dismissed the complaint of the appellant/complainant for want of evidence. But the complaint is liable to be dismissed on this ground also that the appellant/complainant have not paid the electricity bill in dispute.
16.     Accordingly, appeal of the appellant/complainant, being devoid of merits, is liable to be dismissed. Therefore, appeal of the appellant/ complainant is dismissed. Order of the District Forum dated 04.11.2016 is upheld. In view of circumstances of the case, both the parties will bear their own costs of this Appeal.
(paras 14 ,15 and 16 of the order of the State Commission)
(as per the translated copy furnished by the petitioner)
6.  Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the complainant has approached this Commission.
7.     We heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. Perused the material on record.
There is a delay of 58 days in filing the present Revision Petition. In the interest of justice, to provide opportunity to the complainant, to settle the matter on merit, the delay is condoned.
8.     On merit, it is seen that the amended bill given by the OPs was not paid by the complainant. There is no evidence to show that the bill was paid by the complainant. Changing the meter reading in connivance with the meter reader shows the ill intention of the complainant who approached the District Forum with unclear hands. In this case, the default was with the complainant herself. Therefore, we do not find any ‘deficiency in service’ or ‘unfair trade practice’ committed by the OP.
9.     We find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned. The State Commission concurred with the findings of the District Forum. We note in particular the observations made by the two fora quoted in paras 4 and 5 above. Within the meaning and scope of section 21(b), we find no grave error in appreciating the evidence by the two fora below, as may cause to require re-appreciation of the evidence in revision. On the face of it, we find no jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice. The complaint was totally devoid of merit and totally ill-conceived.
10.  The revision petition is dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      The complainants/ respondents are farmers growing apple crop in District Uttarkashi of Uttarakhand.  The crop of the complainants was insured with the petitioner Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd.,  under a scheme framed by Government of India, which was also adopted by the State Governments.  Under the scheme, compensation in case of adverse weather incidence was payable in the farmers who were insured with the insurance company.
2.      The adverse incidence was the equivalent of the deviation between ‘Trigger Weather’ and ‘Actual Weather’ date recorded at a ‘Reference Weather Station’ during the specified time-period. In case of an adverse weather incidence for at least 5 days all the insured cultivators growing the notified crop in the reference units area were entitled to pay out the under scheme.
3.      The Government of Uttarakhand, while implementing the said scheme in the State, directed that though reference unit area will be treated as the basis to accept a risk and analyzing the compensation, if the estimates by reference weather stations are not available the estimates for those days by fixed Backup Weather Centres will be used.  It was further stipulated that it related figures of even the Backup Weather Stations are not available then the estimates for those days from nearby weather stations will be used with the consent of the horticulture department of Uttarakhand.
4.      The complainants who are covered under the insurance scheme of the petitioner company, lodged claims alleging excess rainfall in the area where apple crop was grown by them.  The claims having not being paid they approach the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.
5.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company, which inter alia, stated in its reply that there was no excess rainfall at least for five rainy days during the covered period i.e. from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014.
6.      The District Forum relying upon the data obtained by the complainant from HARC (Himalaya Action Research Centre), which is situated air distance of 200 meters and road distance of only about 1.5 km allowed the consumer complaints.
7.      Being aggrieved from order the passed by the District Forum the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. The said appeals having been dismissed the petitioner company is before this Commission.
8.      As noted earlier, the scheme framed by Government of India and implemented by Government of Uttarakhand envisaged pay out towards the compensation only if the adverse weather condition was recorded by the Reference Weather Station (RWS) of data for the relevant period was available from the RWS, the data from any other weather stations could not have been used for the purpose of claiming or making the payout.  Even the data from the Backup Weather Station could be used only in case the data for the relevant period was not available from the RWS.
9.      In the present cases the data from the RWS was actual available. A perusal of said data would show that during the period from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014 there was no excess rainfall for at least 5 days.  Therefore, relying upon the aforesaid data no compensation to the complainants became payable.
10.    The submission of the learned counsel for the complainant is that since the HARC is situated much nearer as compared to the RWS, the data provided by the HARC is bound to more reliable and should be used for the purpose of compensating the farmers particular when the object of the scheme is to compensate the farmers whose crops is affected on account of bad weather condition, including excess rainfall.  The submission, though attractive, cannot be accepted since it runs contrary to the specific terms of the insurance scheme under which the crop of the complainant was insured. The said scheme envisaged payout towards the compensation only if the data provided by RWS indicated excess rainfall, in case such a data was actually available for the relevant period.  The data of a weather station, other than the RWS cannot be used for claiming compensation in terms of the scheme even if the said weather station happens to be nearer then the RWS.
11.    This Commission is bound to decide the consumer complaint on the basis of the terms and condition of the insurance policy.  Since the said terms and conditions do not permit to use of data from a nearby weather station other than the RWS, unless neither the data from the RWS nor the data from Backup Weather Station is available, the fora below in my opinion could not have used of data of HARC for the purpose of compensating the complainants.
12.    In fact the issue involved in this petition is no more res integra in view of the decision of this Commission in Tirath Ram Thakur vs. Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. & Anr. Revision Petition No.3282-3283 of 2014 decided on 11.07.2017 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“14.    COMPENSATION (PAYOUT)
(I)      AIC shall be responsible for all Payouts arising out of “Adverse Weather Incidence” strictly in terms of the Scheme terms & conditions read with the relevant Premium & Payout tables.  However, this responsibility of AIC shall attach only when the ‘Risk has incepted’, that is, AIC has duly received the FULL PREMIUM, directly from the Insured his own part, AND ALSO the corresponding Premium Subsidy part from the Governments.
(II)     Pay-out shall arise ONLY in case of Adverse Weather Incidence.  Adverse Weather Incidence is equivalent to the deviation between “Trigger Weather” and “Actual Weather” Data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time-period.  Trigger Weather is a pre-defined Weather Parameter applicable to a Notified Crop in a notified Reference Unit Area.
In case of Adverse Weather Incidence (AWI), all the insured cultivators growing the Notified Crop in the Reference Unit Area shall be deemed to have suffered the same level of AWI and the same proportion of crop-loss, and become eligible for the same rate of Payouts.”                      (Emphasis added)
It is manifest from the highlighted portion of the Scheme, in para (II), that the Payout in case of Adverse Weather Incidence has to be determined on the basis of the data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time period.  On a pointed query, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner candidly admits that insofar as the Complainant’s Orchard is concerned, the relevant “Reference Weather Station” was Naggar and not Bahang.  That being so, we are unable to read any material irregularity or illegality in the impugned order, wherein the compensation payable to the Complainant has been determined on the basis of the weather data recorded at the said “Reference Weather Station”.
We are also unable to agree with the learned Counsel that the afore-noted stipulation in the Scheme is unfair to the Agriculturists.  The vires of the terms and conditions of a public policy cannot be examined in a Complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”
13.    The decision of this Commission in Revision Petition No.1654/2016 in  Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. Vs. Badri Singh Bisht & Anr. decided on 24.10.2016 also deals with this issue and to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“2.  It would thus be seen that the scheme was to be implemented on area approach basis wherein reference unit areas were to be notified for the purpose of insurance of the crop.  The reference unit areas were ordinarily to cover a radius of about 25 kms in case of rainfall and 100 kms in case of other weather parameters such as frost, heat, relative humidity etc.  Reference Weather Stations were also designated under the scheme for the purpose of providing weather data applicable to the area covered by a concerned reference unit area, for the purpose of calculation of compensation.  It is also evident that the compensation was to be paid strictly in terms of the aforesaid scheme and the computation of the compensation was dependent upon the weather in the reference unit area as per the data provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The actual loss if any suffered by the farmers had no bearing on the quantum of compensation payable under the scheme, and in case of abnormal weather, uniform compensation was payable to all the farmers in the affected area irrespective of the extent of their loss.
7.      As noted earlier, the computation of compensation in terms of the scheme was to be made on the basis of the data of the adverse weather provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The case of the petitioner is that Kashipur was the Reference Weather Station notified by the Government for Kotabag.  There is absolutely no evidence or even an allegation that a Reference Weather Station other than Kashipur had been notified by the State Commission for the area of Kotabag.  Therefore, there is reason to reject the case of the petitioner company that Kashmir was the concerned Reference Weather Station.  As far as Pantnagar is concerned, that was only a back-up station and the data at Pantnagar was to be considered only in the event of data not being available at Kashipur which was the designated Reference Weather Station for areas including Kotabag.  Therefore, the petitioner company was fully justified in computing the compensation on the basis of the data collected and provided by Kashipur Reference Weather Station.
8.      A perusal of the computation sheets filed by the petitioner company shows that the compensation was calculated as per the weather data provided by the Reference Weather Station at Kashipur.  Since the scheme envisaged payment of compensation computed solely on the basis of the data provided by the Reference Weather Station, the computation made and the compensation paid by the petitioner company to the complainants cannot be faulted with, even if the actual loss suffered by the complainant was substantially higher.  It can hardly be denied that the compensation paid to the complainants was very meagre and more or less nominal but, the scheme as framed by the Government, does not envisage payment of a higher compensation or a compensation based upon the actual loss suffered by the farmers.  Therefore, the direction for payment of compensation awarded by the District Forum cannot be sustained.”
14.    For the reasons stated above, the impugned orders cannot be sustained and same are hereby set aside.  The consumer complaints are consequently with no order as to costs.
15.    The amount which the petitioner company had deposited with this commission be refunded to it along with interest may have accrued on it.
","15.    The amount which the petitioner company had deposited with this commission be refunded to it along with interest may have accrued on it.

4.      The insured died on 06.10.2010. Her son Narender Kumar, the petitioner filed insurance claim for all the policies with necessary claim papers. It was alleged that OPs repudiated the claim without any sufficient reason. Being aggrieved, the complainant filed a complaint in the District Forum, Narnaul.
5.      The opposite party LIC in its written statement submitted that at the time of obtaining insurance policies the insured had concealed a material fact. She was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and underwent Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR ) surgery in 2003.
6.      The District Forum, after hearing the parties, allowed the complaint.
7.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 separate appeals before the State Commission.
","8.      The State Commission allowed all the appeals with a common Order dated 12.04.2016 because the question of facts and law involved was identical and consequently dismissed all the complaints.
9.      Being aggrieved, the complainants filed 09 revision petitions before this Commission under section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
10.    Heard the learned counsel for both sides. Perused the entire material on record.
11.    The State Commission clearly observed in paras 10, 16 and 21 of its Order dated 12.04.2016 that the insured suppressed the material facts while filling the proposal form. The relevant paragraphs are reproduced as below:
10.  LIC also sought the opinion of Dr. R.R. Kasiwal. It has been certified by Dr. Kasliwal vide Exhibit R – 7 that earlier the patient (insured ) was admitted in the hospital on September 22nd, 2010 and was discharged on 27th 2010. In column No. 4, the nature of ailment has been mentioned “breathlessness, RHD, Post MVR (2003) Severe TR”. From these two documents (Exhibit R- 6 & R-7), it is clear that the insured was a patient of Rheumatic Heart Disease and Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) was performed in 2003.
­- - - -
16.     On the aforesaid facts and principle enunciated, the right to claim insurance benefits by the complainants does not survive in view of the medical record, that is, Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R. Kasliwal. Thus, it stands established to the hilt that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the Insurance Policies and she suppressed this fact in her statements (proposal forms) made at the time of purchasing the insurance policies.
- - - -
21. In the case in hand, LIC has proved by leading cogent evidence consisting of Death Summary (Exhibit R-6) and Certificate (Exhibit R-7) issued by Dr. R.R Kasliwal, Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon that the insured was suffering from heart disease prior to the date of purchase of the insurance policies. So, the authorities referred to above are no help to the complainants.
- - -
12.    Thus it is apparent that the insured was a known case of RHD and underwent MVR surgery before obtaining the policy. She had not disclosed the information about her treatment in the proposal form at column no. 11. Thus it was a material suppression of facts which is not acceptable in a contract of insurance, which is a contract in good faith, uberrima fides.
13.    Hon’ble Supreme Court and this Commission have held in several cases about the concealment of material information. In the case of Modern Insulators Ltd. Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2000) 2 SCC 734, Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
It is the fundamental principle of insurance law that utmost good faith must be observed by the contracting parties and the good faith forbids either party from non-disclosure of the facts which the parties know. ………
14.    We have perused the written version filed by the LIC of India before the District Forum. It is pertinent to note that in its written version, the stand taken by the LIC of India (OP) was as below:
The opp. Parties are not liable for making any payment to the complainant under the above said policies. Therefore keeping in the view the above said facts the complainant is not entitled to get any relief. The decision dated 01.08.2011 passed by the Sr. Divisional Manager is according to law and facts and is in favour of principle of natural justice and falls within definition of self speaking decision, hence the claim of the complainant was rightly repudiated by the competent authority as per terms and conditions of the policy and admitted the liability to refund the 90% of first premium paid under the policy. The complainant has concealed the real material facts before the Hon’ble consumer forum and misleading the Hon’ble forum by presenting wrong facts. Hence the complainant is not entitled to any relief as claimed in the complaint.
(emphasis supplied)
15.    We find the Order of the State Commission to be well-appraised and well-reasoned and needs more interference and the same is affirmed.  There is no merit in the revision petitions and the same are dismissed.
16.    In reference to paragraph no. 14, we note that the deceased insured had paid certain amount(s) towards first premium(s) in every policy. Therefore, the LIC of India shall refund 90% of the first premium amount in respect of each policy paid by the insured as admitted by the LIC of India in its written statement. The refund may be ensured within four weeks from the date of pronouncement of this Order, else it will carry interest @ 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment.
With this direction all the revision petitions are disposed of.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
17.    Heard the Petitioner in person and the learned Counsel for the Respondent. Perused the material on record.
18.    In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Petitioner, to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing these 09 Revision Petitions is condoned.
19.    The short point in this matter is that one Smt. Laxmi Devi, the insured, the mother of one Mr. Narendra Kumar Jain, the Complainant, the Petitioner herein, had purchased 09 life insurance policies from the LIC, the Opposite Party, the Respondent herein, in which the Complainant was the nominee.
The dates of commencement of the policies were 28.12.2008 (04 policies) and 01.01.2009 (05 policies).
The insured expired on 06.10.2010, i.e. within two years of commencement of the policies.
The LIC repudiated the claim on the ground that the insured was suffering from Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and had undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, this fact was not disclosed in the proposal form / personal statement, the insured made deliberate incorrect statements and withheld correct information regarding her health. As such the LIC repudiated the said 09 claims, but admitted to its liability to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions.
As evident from its written version, the LIC took the same stand before the District Forum, that the claims were repudiated for deliberate incorrect statements and withholding correct information regarding her health by the insured but 90% of the first premium paid in each policy would be refunded as per the policy conditions.
20.    The District Forum had allowed the Complaints.
The State Commission, in appeal, has dismissed the Complaints, inter alia observing that “12.  In the proposal forms, the insured stated that her usual state of health was good and she never suffered from any heart disease, liver, stomach etc. Thus, from the evidence available on record, it is established that insured had concealed the material fact with regard to her health.”.
21.    An insurance contract has to be in utmost good faith, by both sides. And in a life insurance contract, existence of pre-existing disease / health condition is a material question, necessarily required to be answered truthfully.
22.    In the instant matter, the insured, while taking multiple (09) life insurance policies, suppressed the (pre-) existence of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and of having undergone Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR) surgery prior to the taking of the policies, which were material facts.
The appraisal made by the State Commission conclusively determines willful and intentional suppression of material facts.
And there is no mitigating factor. It is reasonable and appropriate to say that
the insured knew what she was signing, she knew the significance of the
information being supplied by her.
23.    The State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. No jurisdictional error, or legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21(b) of the Act 1986.
24.    It goes without saying that the LIC would be duty-bound to comply with its affirmation to refund 90% of the first premium paid in each policy as per the policy conditions. If the said refund has not already made in respect of each policy, it shall be made within a period of four weeks of the pronouncement of this Order, failing which the said amount(s) shall carry interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of pronouncement of this Order till actual payment(s).
25.    Disposed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/petitioner purchased a tractor manufactured by respondent No.1 New Holland Fiat  (India) Pvt. Ltd. from its dealer Bharat Tractors and Motors at a price of Rs.8,15,000/- on 21.10.2011. The tractor was delivered to the complainant on 24.10.2011. The complainant alleged defect in the tractor which was delivered to him on 24.10.2011 and, therefore, the said tractor was replaced by another tractor delivered to him on 6.12.2011. The case of the complainant/petitioner is that even the second tractor delivered to him was defective  and had manufacturing defect. The tractor, therefore, was allegedly left in the workshop when it had run for 1800 hours. Alleging manufacturing defect  in the tractor delivered to him, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking the price which he had paid for the tractor with compensation etc.
2.      The complaint was resisted by both – the manufacturer as well as the dealer who denied any manufacturing defect in the tractor.
3.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the respondents approached the concerned State Commission by way of two separate appeals. Vide impugned order dated 21.12.2016 the State Commission allowed the appeals and modified the order of the District Forum by directing the manufacturer to undertake necessary repairs in the tractor and make it roadworthy and operational. However, instead of taking the tractor to the workshop of the respondents for carrying out repairs in terms of the order of the State Commission, the petitioner has approached this Commission by way of these two separate revision petitions.
4.      The only question involved in these petitions is as to whether the tractor which was delivered to the complainant on 6.12.2011 suffered from a manufacturing defect or not. A perusal of the job cards which were issued from time to time when the tractor was taken to the workshop would show that no specific manufacturing defect in the tractor was even reported at the time the tractor was taken to the workshop on 25.12.2012, 29.1.2013, 30.1.2013, 26.5.2013 and 16.10.2013. Only general checkup and oil change was done at the time the tractor was taken on 25.12.2012. There was complaint of water heating and boiling and average being given by the tractor when it was taken to the workshop on 29.1.2013. The endorsement signed by the complainant while taking delivery of the tractor on that date would show that all the repairs were carried out with his knowledge and to his entire satisfaction. There was complaint of head gasket being damaged when the tractor was taken to the workshop on 30.1.2013 and the head gasket was replaced by the workshop without any charges. The tractor was received by the complainant on that date certifying that all the repairs mentioned therein had been carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction. The tractor was thereafter taken to the workshop after about four months on 26.5.2013. The job card shows that the tractor had been hit on the guard assembly which was replaced by the workshop without any charges from the complainant. Again the complainant received the tractor certifying that the repairs were carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction. At the time the tractor was last taken to the workshop on 16.10.2013 after about five months, there was no specific complaint with respect to the tractor and only general checkup was done alongwith change of the engine oil and filter. This time also the complainant received the tractor with the requisite certificate signed by him while receiving the tractor.
5.      The learned counsel for the complainant submits that the engine of the tractor was never replaced by the respondents and it was falsely stated so in the job card dated 26.3.2012. The said contention however cannot be accepted since the job card where replacement of the engine has been recorded was duly signed by the complainant and  in any case no complaint seeking replacement of the engine was made at the time when the tractor was taken to the workshop on the subsequent dates.
6.      It would thus be seen that at no point of time the complainant alleged any manufacturing defect in the tractor which was taken to the workshop several times after it was delivered on 6.12.2011. The only worthwhile complaint was made by him on 29.1.2013 when he complained  of water heating and boiling as well as the average problem. Both the aforesaid problems were duly addressed and the tractor was returned to him on the same day after he had signed a certificate to the effect that the repairs had been carried out with his knowledge and to his satisfaction.
7.      The complainant did not examine any automobile engineer to prove that the tractor delivered to him by the respondents suffered from a manufacturing defect. The failure of the complainant to examine an automobile engineer or even to file a report from an expert becomes material when viewed in the light of the complaints which he had made at the time when he took the tractor to the workshop of the respondents. Had there been any manufacturing defect in the tractor, it would not have run for 1800 hours, the complainant would certainly have reported the alleged manufacturing defect when he took the tractor to the workshop of the respondents and in any case he would have requested an expert to examine the tractor and give a report pointing out the defects if any in the tractor. That having not been done, the State Commission, in my opinion, was justified in setting aside the order of the District Forum and substituting its order by directing the respondents to carry out the repairs required, if any, in the tractor and make it roadworthy.  Instead of coming to this Commission, the petitioner ought to have taken the tractor to the workshop soon after the order of the State Commission. That having not been done, he must necessarily face the consequences.
","8.      However, in order to ensure substantial justice it  is directed that if the petitioner takes the tractor to an authorized workshop of respondent No.1 New Holland Fiat  (India) Pvt. Ltd. within four weeks and it is found that the tractor has been used only for about 1800 hours, the defects if any in the tractor shall be removed and it will be delivered back to the complainant alongwith certificate from an automobile engineer certifying therein that the tractor is free from any defect and is in a roadworthy condition. Both the revision petitions stand disposed of.

","ORDER
1.     Learned counsel for the revisionist complainant and the respondent insurance co. made their respective arguments, de novo, in their totality.
The entire material on record was perused.
2.     The dispute relates to repudiation of an accident claim.
The short point involved is that the State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 19.11.2012, allowed the appeal of the insurance co. and dismissed the complaint, inter alia observing that the driver, one Mr. Rishi Pal, was holding two driving licences, which was against the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988.
Extracts from the State Commission’s impugned Order are reproduced below for ready appreciation:
- - - The observation of the Hon’ble National Commission in JAI PARKASH GOYAL’s case (Supra) is as under:-
“4.      Before the State Commission it was urged by the counsel for the complainant that possessing of two driving licences by a driver may be an offence under the Motor Vehicle Act, but the same is not sufficient to deny the claim of the complainant. when holding of two licences is prohibited under the law and is an offence, we fail to understand as to how and why the same cannot be pressed into service for rejecting the claim since holding of two licences at the same time would not only be in contravention of Rule 6 would be that the second driving licence obtained by a person would be invalid for all practical purposes as the same was obtained in contravention of Provision 6 of the said Act. Any other interpretation would be the violation of the provision of the said Act. Besides this, it was also found that the tanker in question was overloaded in breach of policy conditions which contributed to the accident.”
This case is fully covered by JAI PARKASH GOYAL’s case (Supra). It has come on the record that Rishi Pal-driver, was driving the vehicle at the time of accident, was holding two driving licences, which is against the provision of the Motor Vehicle Act and therefore the opposite party cannot be held liable to pay any insurable benefit to the complainant. Hence, the order of the District Forum cannot sustain.
","For the reasons recorded above, this appeal is accepted, the impugned order is set aside and the complaint is dismissed.- - -
3.     From the material available on file, and inter alia specifically from the copies of the surveyor’s report dated 15.03.2008, the verification report dated 05.07.2008 from the R.T.A. of Nalabari in Assam and the surveyor’s letter dated 16.07.2008, as also from the facts of the case recorded in the District Forum’s Order dated 27.02.2012 and in the State Commission’s Order dated 19.11.2012, it is well evinced that it was first claimed that the driver, the said one Mr. Rishi Pal, had a driving licence from the R.T.A. of Nalabari in Assam, which, but, on verification, was found to be fake. The said licence, though, was subsequently renewed from the L.A. of Jind in Haryana. Another licence, from the D.T.O. of Agra in U.P., was also adduced before the forum of original jurisdiction i.e. the District Forum. As such, at the time of the accident the driver ostensibly had two licences.
4.     Though a decision of the insurance ombudsman is not binding on consumer protection fora, which independently adjudge ‘deficiency in service’ and / or ‘unfair trade practice’ under the provision of the Act 1986, in the present case it is significant and material that the insurance ombudsman had dismissed the claim on 02.06.2009 holding that the driver was not having a valid and effective driving licence as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, thereafter which the complainant filed his complaint before the District Forum on 16.08.2010.
5.     The District Forum allowed the complaint. However the State Commission dismissed the complaint, holding that “It has come on the record that Rishi Pal driver, was driving the vehicle at the time of accident, was holding two driving licences, which is against the provision of the Motor Vehicle Act and therefore the opposite party cannot be held liable to pay any insurable benefit to the complainant.”.
6.     Looking at it another way, it is admitted, as also borne from the record, that it was first and foremost intimated to the insurance co. that the driver was having a driving licence ostensibly issued by the R.T.A. of Nalabari in Assam. The said licence, on verification, was found to be fake. It was subsequently renewed from Jind in Haryana. Renewal of a fake licence does not make it valid, it remains what it was, that is, a fake licence, non est. This ab initio fraud and malafide are in themselves sufficient to vitiate the claim.
7.     The insurance co., thus, cannot be faulted.
8.     The revision petition is dismissed.
9.     ‘Dasti’, in addition.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, MEMBER
“Watchful waiting” is one of the option, also called as related to Masterly Inactivity or Expectant Management is a `hands-off management` philosophy in which certain medical conditions are closely monitored, but treatment is withheld until symptoms either appear or some measurable parameter changes.
1.      Both the Appeals have been filed against the Order dated 09.05.2018, passed by the UP State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short the ‘State Commission’) which allowed the Complaint No. C-2002/23. For convenience, the facts are drawn from FA/1323/2018 and the Parties are placed as represented in the Complaint.
2.      Brief facts are that Mr. Sandeep Arora, Complainant No. 1 (for short the ‘patient’) suffered scooter accident on 04.08.2000 and suffered fracture to his left hand. Initially, he consulted Dr. T.N. Gupta at Deoria. X-ray showed fracture of Humerus (arm) and took treatment for 4 days. Thereafter on 09.08.2000 he approached Dr. R. A. Agarwal (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 2) at Agarwal Orthopaedic Hospital (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 1) at Gorakhpur. The Opposite Party No. 2 examined the patient and advised for surgical correction of fracture and the patient got admitted in the Opposite Party No. 1 Hospital. As the Titanium Rod was to be obtained from Delhi, the operation was fixed for 13.08.2000. The Opposite Party No. 2 operated the patient on 13.08.2000 and fixed the Titanium Closed Interlocking Rod with 4 screws in the fractured Humerus bone. The Complainant alleged that the rod and the screws were oversized and were not fixed properly. It was further alleged that on 14.08.2000, the Opposite Party No. 2 examined the X-ray of patient’s left arm which showed the interlocking rod and screws were oversized and a gap visible between the broken bones. The Complainants were apprehensive and they asked the Opposite Party No. 2 to get another X-ray done on 16.08.2000 to check whether the gap had increased, but the Opposite Party No. 2 advised the patient to continue the medicines as the bone was uniting. The patient was discharged from the Opposite Party No. 1 Hospital on 18.08.2000, though he had pain in his left hand. Thereafter, on 16.01.2001, the patient got himself examined in the District Hospital, Deoria and the fresh X-ray showed the gap was more and the bones were not united. The doctors therein suggested the patient to undergo another operation. Thereafter, patient went to Mariampur Hospital at Kanpur and got operated on 31.01.2001, wherein the Titanium close interlocking rod was removed and bone grafting with plating was done. The post-operative X-ray showed the bone was united.
Being aggrieved by the alleged negligence during the operation, the Complainants filed the Complaint before the State Commission and prayed compensation for loss of income, mental and physical stress to the patient and his family members.
3.      The Opposite Parties filed their written statement and denied the allegations of the wrong treatment. The patient was admitted in the Opposite Party No. 1 Hospital on 09.08.2000. He brought the X-ray and prescription of Dr. T.N. Singh dated 04.08.2000. X-ray showed a fracture shaft of left Humerus. The operation of Titanium closed interlocking rod was done on 13.08.2000, as per standard procedure. The X-ray taken on 16.8.2000 showed proper position of rod and there was no gap between the fractured area. The Opposite Party No. 1 denied the penetration of screws and rod into the muscles, which was not possible for such a long period. The patient did not follow the instructions for physiotherapy. He was in good condition when the stitches were removed. The Opposite Parties further submitted that the patient, over phone, informed Opposite Party No. 2 that he fell down from his bed and suffering from pain in his left hand. The patient was called on 11.11.2000, the X-ray of his hand showed that the screws were loose with a minor gap. However, the rod was in correct place and the fractured bone showed proper alignment with new bone formation. Patient was advised to wait as the minor gap would be covered by the new formation of bone. The patient, thereafter, did not turn up to the Opposite Party No. 1 hospital.
4.      The State Commission, on hearing the parties, passed the following Order:
Order
","The Complaint is allowed. The OPs are severally and jointly directed to pay Rs. 96,686.00 and further a sum of Rs. 1 lakh as compensation and Rs. 10,000/- as cost to the Complainant No. 1 within a month otherwise the OPs shall be liable to pay interest @ 10% p.a. on the entire awarded amount.
5.      Being aggrieved, both the Parties have filed two cross Appeals before this Commission. The Complainants filed First Appeal No 760 of 2019 for enhancement of compensation whereas the Opposite Parties filed First Appeal No. 1323 of 2018 to set aside the order of the State Commission.
6.      Heard the arguments of the learned Counsel for both sides and perused the material on record inter alia the Original Record from the State Commission.
7.      The short delay of two days in filing First Appeal No. 1323 of 2018 is condoned. However, there is a delay of 320 days in filing First Appeal No. 760 of 2019. In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the Complainants and to decide the case on merit, the self-admitted delay of 320 days is condoned.
8.      The learned Counsel for the Complainants submitted that the Opposite Party No. 2 has committed deficiency in service while conducting operation on 13.08.2000 because the Titanium interlocking rod was put in on the basis of old X-ray done on 04.08.2000. The Opposite Party No. 2 got X-ray done on 14.08.2000 which revealed gap of 1mm to 2mm and another X-ray was again taken on 16.08.2000 which also showed same gap. He further submitted that an oversized Titanium interlocking rod and screws were fixed whereby the patient was getting pain. The patient went to the Opposite Party No. 2 on 11.11.2000, the X-ray revealed more gap between bones and the screws were protruding through the flesh but the Opposite Party No. 2 ignored it and asked the patient to come after 2 months, but his condition worsened further. The bones did not unite and therefore on 31.01.2001 the patient finally underwent another operation at Mariampur Hospital at Kanpur whereby the Titanium Rod was taken out and bone grafting was done. Thus, it was the negligence in the duty of care from the Opposite Party No. 2 doctor.
9.      Learned Counsel for the Opposite Parties submitted that the Opposite Party No. 2 is an experienced Orthopaedic Surgeon. He performed the operation under C-Arm vision screen and there was no chance of procedural mistake. The X-rays were examined before and after the operation. There was no gap after the operation. The Opposite Party No. 2 neither used oversized Titanium interlocking rod nor the oversized screws. The union of bone was not guaranteed and the gap seen may be due to various reasons such as pressure, fall, cohabitation, any hit / trauma to the fractured bone and due to non-formation of callous in normal manner.
10.    We gave our thoughtful consideration to the arguments from both sides. Perused the material on record inter alia the Medical Record of Opposite Party No. 1 Hospital and the medical text on long bone fractures from Campbell’s Operative Orthopaedics (14th Edition).
11.    We note the patient was operated on 13.08.2000. The post-operative X-rays dated 14.08.2000 and 16.08.2000 revealed minimal gap.  The Complainant approached the Opposite Party No. 1 Hospital after about 3 months on 11.11.2000. According to the patient the X-ray done on 11.11.2000 revealed the gap was widened and the Opposite Party No. 2 should have taken necessary steps to correct the gap but   the patient after two months. It is pertinent to note that the patient did not follow the medical advice for exercise and the physiotherapy. Moreover he fell down from the bed and sustained external trauma / pressure on his left hand which caused increase in the gap between the fractured bones. However, it is evident from X-ray dated 11.11.2000 there was proper bone alignment and the rod in proper shape. We do not find any cogent evidence produced by the Complainant that the rod or screws used during surgery were oversized. It is further noted from the medical record of Mariampur Hospital that Dr. P. M. Gadre operated the patient on 31.01.2001. He did not comment on the size/extent of gap at the fractured site and any negligence from the Opposite Party No. 2 during previous operation caused either non-union or mal-union  of bones.
12.    We further note that the Opposite Party No. 2, who is a qualified and experienced Orthopedician followed the accepted standard method to treat the fracture Humerus with use of C-Arm during the procedure. The new bone (callus) formation at fractured site takes long period and thus the patient was advised to wait and do regular exercise and physiotherapy. In our considered view, it was the act i.e. “Watchful waiting” from the Opposite Party No. 2. It is also called as related to Masterly Inactivity or Expectant Management is a `hands-off management` philosophy in which certain conditions are closely monitored, but treatment is withheld until symptoms either appear or some measurable parameter changes. (Ref: Segen's Medical Dictionary. © 2012 Farlex, Inc.). Thus, watchful expectancy or masterly inactivity is despite whatever appears to a patient, is NOT, and we reiterate is NOT neglect or negligence, as the layperson might be tempted to believe - it simply means acting with necessary patience, using good sense, experience coupled with prudency, as the situation dictates in circumstances in which, there is no pressing action or no qualified need for urgent or emergent intervention. Therefore, we are unable to understand that within short span of time i.e. 3 months the patient underwent the second surgery at Mariampur Hospital, Kanpur. It was hurried intervention which is not advisable.
13.    Technically, a Non-union is defined as, `A fracture that is a minimum of 9 months post occurrence and is not healed and has not shown radiographic progression for 3 months` (FDA 1986). In the instant case, it is indeed documented by the first Surgeon that 3 months after first surgery there was evidence of early callus formation and thus he recommended watchful expectancy for fracture healing. Merely because a second intervention was executed and has led to bone union, it does not automatically imply that the first intervention would have necessarily failed wherein the Surgeon was keeping a vigilant eye on the progress of the healing and was ready to, if necessary, intervene.
14.    Further, literature suggests that `an apparent gap` despite internal fixation is often seen on post-operative radiographs. These gaps are not physical gaps but merely zones of decalcified bone at the site of the opposing fracture surfaces. It is all too easy to point out these gaps to a layperson that in his vulnerable state, panics and starts doubting the original intervention performed.
15.    It should be borne in mind that an `Active monitoring` is a well-accepted form of any on-going` treatment. Patients are led to believe, albeit in many cases by secondary service providers that great and hurried intervention is always required or vital in their case and thus the original Surgeon who has shown patience, supported by literature and yet, is ready for `further intervention if need be` does not always qualify as negligent or neglectful by any stretch of imagination. Indeed, history is testimony that many surgical disasters could also have been avoided by preventing overenthusiastic and interventions whereas watchful expectancy would have sufficed.
16.    What may appears as a heroic `early second intervention` which has palpably caused a positive impression on the patients mind cannot be used as a weapon to castigate the original surgeon or his methods who was following a well-accepted treatment plan including `watchful expectancy`. Such an assumption based on `what could have been…` is too presumptuous, simplistic and thus, untenable. It has become all too common for some medical personnel to present a `one up `view of their own practice to impress or convince a patient of additional treatments or alternative remedy, which may be in essence unrequired at that point of time. Such a patient intent on blaming someone for their misfortune and possibly arisen to a combination of his injury mechanism or complex pattern, his existing co-morbidities, in combination with slower biology by many other variables, is now all too ready to blame the original Surgeon and thereby cause injustice to the actually prudent practitioner of medicine.
17.    The doctor is not liable for negligence if he performs his duty with reasonableness and with due care. The mode of treatment and skill differ from doctor to doctor. We would like to rely upon the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case - Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa and others versus State of Maharashtra & Ors., (1996) 2 SCC 634, wherein it was held that;
“The skill of medical practitioners differs from doctor to doctor. The very nature of the profession is such that there may be more than one course of treatment which may be advisable for treating a patient. Courts would indeed be slow in attributing negligence on the part of a doctor if he has performed his duties to the best of his ability and with due care and caution. Medical opinion may differ with regard to the course of action to be taken by a doctor treating a patient, but as long as a doctor acts in a manner which is acceptable to the medical profession, and the Court finds that he has attended on the patient with due care skill and diligence and if the patient still does not survive or suffers a permanent ailment, it would be difficult to hold the doctor to be guilty of negligence.”
In the instant case, the Opposite Party No. 2 treated the patient as per the standards. There was no negligence while performing the fracture operation and fixing the Titanium interlocking rod and screws to the Humerus.
18.    On the basis of the examination made above, deficiency / medical negligence is not established. We set aside the Order passed by the State Commission and dismiss the Complaint. Parties to bear their own cost.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
An FDR with respondent No.1 bank for Rs.50,000/- was taken in the joint name of late Shri Bandopanth Balwant Belekar and respondent No.2 Smt. Sharada Ramchandra Belekar.  Shri Bandopanth Balwant Belekar having died, the FDR proceeds were transferred by the bank in the account of respondent No.2. The petitioner had given a letter to the bank informing that he was going apply for a Succession Certificate and, therefore, the FDR  proceeds should be withheld by the bank. Since the FDR proceeds were transferred in the account of respondent No.2, the petitioner could not get any share in that amount despite having obtained the  Succession Certificate.
","2.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the respondent No.1 Bank approached the concerned State Commission  by way of an appeal. By the impugned order dated 25.3.2014, the State Commission  allowed the appeal and dismissed the complaint. Being aggrieved, the complainant is before this Commission.
3.      It is an admitted position that the FDR was taken in the joint name of late Shri Bandopanth Balwant Belekar and respondent No.2 Smt. Sharada Ramchandra Belekar. Since a joint FDR was taken, the bank was fully justified in transferring the FDR proceeds in the account of respondent No.2, she being the joint holder of the FDR with the deceased.  Admittedly, there was no order from any Court prohibiting the bank from transferring the money to the account of respondent No.2. Even the Succession Certificate had not been obtained by the date on which the money was transferred by the bank to the account of respondent No.2. The case of the bank is that no letter requesting the bank to withhold the money on the ground that the complainant was applying for the Succession Certificate was received before the money was transferred to the account of respondent No.2, though according to the learned counsel for the complainant the letter was sent before the transfer. Therefore, there was no deficiency on the part of the bank in rendering services to the complainant. The impugned order, therefore, does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revision jurisdiction.  The revision petition is, therefore, dismissed. However, it is made clear that the dismissal of the revision petition shall not come in the way of the petitioner availing such legal remedy as may be open to him in law against respondent No.2 and in case he approaches the Civil Court, he shall be entitled to seek benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act if such a benefit is otherwise admissible to him in law. The revision petition stands disposed of.

","JUDGEMENT
JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainants / appellants are allottees of residential flats in a scheme, namely, Super Deluxe Flats which the respondent  Punjab State Federation of co-operative House Building Societies Ltd. was to construct in Sector 79 of SAS Nagar Mohali. The appellants, according to their counsel applied for flats and were given allocation in the year 2004. No specific date for delivery of possession of the flats was promised by the respondent. The possession to them, however, came to be offered only between July 2014 to January 2015. The excess stamp duty had also been recovered from them, which was later refunded to them without any interest. Being aggrieved, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the excess stamp duty which was recovered from them which was later refunded to them as well as interest for the delay in delivery of possession with compensation etc. Interest was sought on the amount which the appellants had already paid to the respondent way back before the possession was offered to them.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent interlia on the ground that the same were barred by limitation.
3.      The State Commission having dismissed the consumer complaints, the appellants/complainants are before this Commission.
4.      The relief claimed by the appellants in these appeals is on two counts, the first relief sought by them being interest and compensation on the delayed possession of the flats and the second relief sought by them being interest on the excess stamp duty which was taken from them but was refunded to them after a substantial time.
5.      Admittedly the possession to the complainants/appellants came to be delivered between July 2014 to March 2015. Admittedly, the excess stamp duty was refunded to them by October 2015
6.      In terms of Section 24A of the C.P. Act, the consumer complaints ought to have been initiated within two years of the accrual  of the cause of action. The said cause of action as far as interest and compensation on the delayed payment is concerned, accrued on the date the possession was taken by the complainants/appellants, without promise of any interest. The cause of action for claiming interest on the excess stamp duty accrued to the complainants/appellants on the date the refund of the excess stamp duty was received by them. Therefore, the consumer complaints ought to have been initiated latest by October, 2017 since the stamp duty is stated  to have been refunded to them by October 2015. Admittedly, the consumer complaints were initiated in the year May, 2019. Admittedly, no application seeking extension of time to file the consumer complaints was filed by the complainants/appellants along with the consumer complaints. The provision of Section 24A of the C.P. Act being mandatory it was imperative for the State Commission  to dismiss the consumer complaints on this ground alone. A reference in this regard can be made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in State Bank of India Vs. M/s B.S. Agricultural Industries (I), II(2009) CPJ 29 (SC) decided on 20.03.2009, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:
8. It would be seen from the aforesaid provision that it is peremptory in nature and requires consumer forum to see before it admits the complaint that it has been filed within two years from the date of accrual of cause of action. The consumer forum, however, for the reasons to be recorded in writing may condone the delay in filing the complaint if sufficient cause is shown. The expression, `shall not admit a complaint' occurring in Section 24A is sort of a legislative command to the consumer forum to examine on its own 5whether the complaint has been filed within limitation period prescribed thereunder. As a matter of law, the consumer forum must deal with the complaint on merits only if the complaint has been filed within two years from the date of accrual of cause of action and if beyond the said period, the sufficient cause has been shown and delay condoned for the reasons recorded in writing. In other words, it is the duty of the consumer forum to take notice of Section 24A and give effect to it. If the complaint is barred by time and yet, the consumer forum decides the complaint on merits, the forum would be committing an illegality and, therefore, the aggrieved party would be entitled to have such order set aside.
7.      The learned counsel for the appellant reference to the decision of this Commission in FA/1086/2014 – Pattathu Borthers Vs. Arunodya Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. dated 20.1.2016. I have perused the decision. In the decision reslied upon by the learned counsel for the complainants/appellants the consumer complaints came to be instituted by a cooperative housing society, alleging deficiency on the part of the respondent by not attending to construction  defects, and by not complying with the provisions of MOFA. The complainant had also sought transfer of right, title and interest in the property. The State Commission having allowed the consumer complaints, the appellant approached this Commission and interlia submitted that the complaint was barred by limitation. The plea was negatived by this Commission holding that the purchase process was not complete until the conveyance deed was registered in favour of the purchasers. Thus the facts were altogether were different from the present cases where the issue is with respect to payment of interest on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had recovered from the appellants and payment of interest for the delayed possession of the allotted flats.  Therefore, the said decision would be of no avail to the appellants.
8.      The learned counsel for the appellants also refers to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Pvt. ltd. Vs. State of Haryana & Anr. [SLP (C) No.13917 of 2009] dated 11.10.2011 and Greater Bombay Co-operative Bank Ltd. Vs. Nagraj Ganeshmal Jain & Ors. [Civil Appeal Nos.9777-9778 of 2017] dated 26.7.2017.  Neither of these judgements is of any avail to the appellants/complainants in these matters, involving altogether different issue.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the order passed by the State Commission does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its appellant jurisdiction. The appeals are, therefore, dismissed, with no order as to costs.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Priya Sankar Bose


                                                (Petitioner No.2 in person and

Authorized Representative for Petitioner-1) 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Souradeep Sarkar, Advocate 
","1.      The present Revision Petition, under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) has been filed by the Petitioners against order dated 23.06.2017 of the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata(for short “State Commission”) in First Appeal No.A/77/2016 wherein the Appeal filed by the Appellants/Petitioners was dismissed.
2.      Case of the Complainants is that a credit card was issued by the Opposite Party/Bank in August, 1999 in the name of Complainant No.1. Unfortunately, after some time he was thrown out of the job and lost capacity to repay the credit card dues. In September, 2000 the Opposite Party/Bank showed a debit balance of Rs.17,722.53. Complainant No.2, father of Complainant No.1 came to know about the debit balance from the statement given by the Bank Manager. On approaching the Bank, a compromise settlement of Rs.13,000/- was agreed. His father gave the Bank three post-dated cheques from his saving bank account. In 2013, when Complainant No.1 approached certain Banks in Bombay for a bank loan, he was informed that the name of Complainant No.1 was found in the CIBIL and no loan could be granted. This caused damage to his integrity, credit worthiness and future financial plans to create assets. He then approached the Bank’s recovery department, Kolkata who informed that the matter could be closed on payment of Rs.25,000/-. After exhausting all hopes for a peaceful settlement of the issue, the Complainants filed a Consumer Forum before the District Forum.
3.      The case was contested by the Opposite Party/Bank in the District Forum. The Bank stated that an opportunity was given to the Complainant to liquidate the dues against his credit card by making payment of a total sum of Rs.13,000/- as per the terms of settlement letter dated 03.10.2000. In terms of the settlement, Complainant No.2 issued three post-dated cheques of Rs.4,333.33 each, dated 03.10.2000, 03.11.2000 and 03.12.2000 towards instalments. As per the settlement, the cheques should be duly paid and honoured on the due dates, in default of which the settlement plan shall be rendered null and void and the dues on account of the credit card would be revived in its entirety. Only two instalments were paid in the month of October and December, 2000 and credit for November, 2000 was not found in the accounts. Having failed to comply with the terms of the settlement, the Bank was entitled to recover the entire dues on account of the credit card of the Complainant. No evidence was shown that the Complainants had actually paid the missing instalment. The Opposite Party, however, later on request of the Complainant waived the dues against credit card and no amount is due and claimed by them from the Complainants at present. The Opposite Party had also placed appropriate entry in the CIBIL record showing that the subject account had been settled. Complaint filed by the Complainants is baseless and motivated and, therefore, the Complainants are not entitled to any relief or compensation or cost as prayed by them.
4.      The District Forum, having heard the Complainants as well as the learned Counsel for the Opposite Party and also considering the evidence and material placed on record, observed that Complainant No.1 was allowed an opportunity by the Opposite Party to pay the dues of his credit card which he did not avail and became a defaulter. His name was entered in the CIBIL list as per the RBI Guidelines. The Opposite Party had also settled the credit card of the Complainant and the matter was recorded as settled in the CIBIL. The District Forum held that the Complaint was not tenable in view of the fact that the matter had already been redressed. The District Forum ordered as follows: -
“ So, apparently it is found that complainants was a noted defaulter in respect of the credit card of the op but op’s credit card has already been closed and there is no dues to pay by the complainants. But invariably on the mercy of the op, complainants have got such relief and in the CIBIL List it is found settled. So, we find that op redressed the claim of the complainants in all respect though they are defaulter and did not pay the entire dues and he suppressed the matter in the complaint for which we find that this complaint is not tenable in view of the  fact that the matter has already been redressed by the complainants and as per admission of the op, this complaint is disposed of accordingly.”
5.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Complainants filed an Appeal before the State Commission. After hearing Complainant No.2 in person and learned Counsel on behalf of the Respondent, as also perusing the record, the State Commission was of the considered view that the impugned judgment and order did not deserve any intervention. The Appeal was dismissed on contest and the judgment and order was affirmed.
6.      Aggrieved by the orders of the State Commission, the Complainants filed a Revision Petition before this Commission.
7.      Heard Petitioner No.2 in person and learned Counsel for the Respondent and have carefully gone through the record. Petitioner No.2 submitted that Complainant No.1 was issued a credit card by the Respondent Bank in August, 1999 with a limit of Rs.19,000/-. Unfortunately, after some months, Complainant No.1 lost his job and dues got accumulated against his credit card. On receiving the statement from the Respondent/Bank, Petitioner No.2 gave three post-dated cheques from his account in fulfilment of the compromise settlement reached between the Petitioners and the Respondent/Bank. Later when Petitioner No.1 approached some Banks in Bombay for obtaining a bank loan, he was informed that his name was found in defaulters’ list in CIBIL and, therefore, no loan could be granted. This destroyed his credit worthiness and all his future plans to create assets. When the Complainants approached the Opposite Party, the Opposite Party demanded payment of Rs.25,000/- for closing the matter.
","8.      The learned Counsel for the Respondent argued that by entering into a settlement with the Complainant, an opportunity was provided by the Respondent/Bank to repay the dues against his credit card by making payment of a total sum of Rs.13,000/- in three instalments. The Complainants did issue three post-dated cheques of Rs.4,333.33 each dated 03.10.2000, 03.11.2000 and 03.12.2000, as per the condition of the settlement letter dated 03.10.2000. From the account statement it appeared that only two instalments were paid in October and December, 2000 and the Complainants failed to pay the agreed instalment in November, 2000. Having failed to comply with the essential condition of the settlement, the Respondent/Bank was entitled to recover the entire credit card dues from the Petitioner. Moreover, the matter has since been settled by them and, therefore, the entire case becomes baseless and needs to be dismissed.
9.      Both the Fora below, after hearing both the parties as well as carefully perusing the record and evidence produced by them, dismissed the Complaint.
10.    Jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21 (b) is very limited. This Commission is not required to re-appreciate and reassess the evidences. The Court can intervene only when the petitioner succeeds in showing that the Fora below has wrongly exercised their jurisdiction or there is a miscarriage of justice. It was so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC 269  as under: -
“13.   Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal  principle  that  was  ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
11.    Same principle has been reiterated by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H & R Johnson (India) Ltd. and Ors. (2016 8 SCC 286 wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
“23.   The  National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in their or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
12.    From the above, it is seen that the Complainant failed in making payment of his credit card dues and entered into a compromise settlement with the Respondent/Bank for payment of the dues in three equal instalments. Having failed to keep up this commitment, as the Petitioner again became a defaulter, his name was found in the CIBIL list. However, from the evidence placed on record it is found that the Respondent/Bank has since settled the matter of the Complainant by waiving the balance and instalment due against the credit card. No amount is found due and no claim is being made by the Respondent/Bank at present. Even the CIBIL list records that the account has been settled. Since the Complainant’s status as defaulter has already been settled by the Respondent/Bank and the credit card had already been closed with the CIBIL list also showing the matter settled, the Complaint was dismissed by both the Fora.
13.    I find no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings of both the Fora. Petitioners have failed to point any illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the State Commission, warranting interference in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Revision Petition is accordingly dismissed.
14.    However, Respondent was to pay Rs.20,000/- to the Petitioners as cost imposed by this Commission, vide order dated 24.05.2019. The amount has not been paid even after expiry of more than one year. The Respondent is, therefore, directed to pay Rs.20,000/- with 9% interest from 24.06.2019 till realization to the Petitioners within eight weeks from the date of this order.

","Revision petition No.122 of 2011 has been filed by the petitioner Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon and Revision Petition No.354 of 2011 has been filed by the petitioner Dr. K.N.S.Dhillon, against the order dated 13.10.2010 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.1286 of 2004.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1/complainant (since deceased and now represented by the LRs.) got his operation done in Amar Hospital, owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon.  The patient remained admitted in Amar Hospital from 11.06.2002 to 22.06.2002 and the operation was performed and plate was fixed.  On 11.12.2002 x-ray was done again and it was found that the deceased was not completely cured.  Again in October, 2003, the x-ray was done and the pain also persisted. By that time the doctor, who had performed the operation had opened his own clinic and he removed the plate.  There was a shortening of about 2 inches in the left leg.  A complaint was filed before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ferozepur, (in short ‘the District Forum’) and the District Forum vide its order dated 17.09.2004 allowed the complaint as under:-
“40  In view of what has been discussed above, this complaint is dismissed against opposite party No.1 without any order as to costs and is accepted against opposite party No.2 with costs of Rs.2,000/- and is directed to pay a sum of Rs.75,000/- to the complainant, which he approximately spent on his treatment, which turned to be futile due to the deficiency in service on his part.  He is also directed to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the complainant as compensation for his mental harassment as his treatment has lingered on as a result of deficiency in service on the part of opposite party No.2.  This order is directed to be complied with within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of its copy.  Copies of this order be communicated to the parties concerned free of costs.”
3.      Aggrieved with the order of the District Forum, the petitioner in RP No.122 of 2011, who was opposite party No.2 in the original complaint filed an appeal before the State Commission being FA No.1286 of 2004.  The State Commission vide its order dated 13.10.2010 passed the following order:-
“Keeping in view the discussion held above, we are satisfied that the appellant and respondent No.2 had committed medical negligence while operating the respondent on 12.6.2002 in the hospital of respondent No.2. Therefore, the compensation awarded by the learned District Forum in the impugned judgment dated 17.9.2004 is upheld.  However it is payable not by the appellant alone but jointly and severally by the appellant and respondent No.2.
52.  This appeal is, therefore, disposed of with costs of Rs.10,000/- with the only modification that respondent No.2 would also be liable with the appellant jointly and severally.  Out of the amount of costs, Rs.5,000/- will go to the New India Assurance Company Ltd. Respondent No.3 and Rs.5,000/- will be payable to respondent No.1.
53.  The costs of Rs.2,000/- awarded by the learned District Form are also upheld.  The impugned judgment dated 17.9.2004 is accordingly modified in the terms stated above.
54. The appellant had deposited an amount of Rs.25,000/- with this Commission at the time of filing of the appeal on 18.10.2004.  He had also deposited a sum of Rs.25,000/- with this Commission under the orders dated 25.1.2005.  The amount of Rs.50,000/- along with interest accrued thereon, if any, be remitted by the registry to Surjit Kumar respondent by way of a crossed cheque/demand draft after the expiry of 45 days, under intimation to the learned District Forum and to the appellant.
55.  Remaining amount, if any, shall be paid by the appellant to Surjit Kumar respondent.  Respondent No.2 shall also pay the amount of his share to Surjit Kumar respondent immediately.”
4.      Hence two revision petitions.
5.      These revision petitions were listed before the Circuit Bench at Chandigarh for the convenience of the parties on 20.1.2020.  The notice has been served to all the parties and all parties were aware about the listing of these revision petitions in Chandigarh.  Learned proxy counsel appeared on behalf of the main counsel for the petitioners and stated that the petitioners have already given the written submissions, which may be looked into for their arguments.  Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant was present and was heard.
6.      I have also seen the written arguments filed by the petitioner. It has been mentioned in RP No.122 of 2011 that the State Commission erred in observing that since petitioner operated the respondent no.1/complainant along with respondent no.2, therefore, medical negligence if proved would be on the part of the petitioner and respondent no.2.  It is submitted that merely on the fact that petitioner was associated with the respondent no.2 for performing the operation of the respondent no.1, it cannot be presumed that petitioner has also committed medical negligence while operating the respondent no.1/complainant.
7.      It has been mentioned that the State Commission failed to appreciate that respondent no.1/complainant withheld the best evidence which was available with him in the form of pre-operative x-ray and post operative x-ray from which it could have been clear that the operation was successful and both the ends of fracture were in position.  It is submitted that preoperative and post operative x-rays were given to the respondent no.1/complainant along with discharge certificate with the advice of follow-up treatment at the time of the discharge.  The State Commission failed to observe that said x-rays are in the possession of the respondent no.1/complainant and the same was withheld by him for the reasons best known to him.  Further it is submitted that this fact remained uncontroverted by the respondent no.1/complainant but District Forum and the State Commission wrongly held that the x-rays were retained by the petitioner.
8.      It is stated in the written arguments that the impugned order is liable to be set aside as State Commission wrongly held both the petitioner and the respondent no.2 for committing medical negligence.  It is submitted that petitioner performed the operation with utmost skill and due care as expected from an experienced medical practitioner.
9.      It is further mentioned that the State Commission as well as the District Forum erred in appreciating the report of the Board of Doctors and misinterpreted the same.  The said report merely observed that mal-alignment could be the cause of shortening of the leg of the respondent no.1/complainant, however, same cannot be interpreted that board of doctors unambiguously held that the shortening of the leg in the case in hand was certainly due to the mal-alignment of fracture fragments.  It was further submitted that there is nothing in the report dated 31.8.2004 which suggests that there was any medical negligence on the part of the petitioner.
10.    In revision petition No.354 of 2011, it has been mentioned that the State Commission failed to appreciate that it was categorically pleaded by the petitioner that the pre-operative and post-operative x-rays were given to the respondent no.1/the complainant along with discharge certificate with the advice of follow up.
11.    It was further stated that the State Commission failed to appreciate that even a bare perusal of the Board constituted by the District Forum, it is clear that there was no negligence on behalf of the petitioner inspite of that the State Commission has upheld the order of the District Forum with modifications making the petitioner liable jointly and severally.
12.    It was further argued that the State Commission failed to appreciate that it is settled law that no liability can be fastened in a case of medical negligence unless and until there is an expert evidence.  In the case in hand, there is no expert evidence against the petitioner wherein the petitioner has been shown to be negligent.  Therefore, unless and until there is any evidence on the record holding the petitioner as negligent, the complaint and impugned order deserves dismissal.
13.    Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that the District Forum had referred the matter for the expert opinion to the Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons and this Board gave its report on 31.8.2004.  Learned counsel stated that the Medical Board has confirmed the shortening of about 2 inches in the left leg.  The reason is given that the same may be due to mal-alignment of the fracture fragments.  Thus, it is clear that during operation fracture fragments were not rightly aligned.  Thus, this was a clear negligence on the part of the operating doctor.
14.    Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon was doctor in the Government Hospital, however, he performed operation in the private hospital namely, Amar hospital.  Thus, he was also guilty of violating the Government Rules.
15.    The pre and post operative x-ray were not provided by the Amar hospital owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon and therefore, the State Commission has treated the hospital also deficient in providing the service.  In fact, there is a clear finding of the State Commission that no proper record was supplied by the Amar hospital, which was a primary duty of the hospital to maintain the proper records of the patient treated in the hospital.  Even the bed ticket was not provided to the Medical Board.  Thus, the State Commission has rightly found joint liability on both the doctors, one being the operating doctor and the other being the owner of the Amar hospital.  The life of the complainant was totally compromised due to shortening of left leg by two inches and ultimately the complainant died and the present matter is being contested by the LRs.  Learned counsel further stated that the LRs. of the complainant are very poor and due to this fact they could not file any appeal for enhancement of the compensation.
16.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the complainant as well as the points raised in the revision petitions.  One of the main objections in the revision petitions is that there is no expert report to show that the operation was wrongly performed and the fracture fragments were mal-aligned in the operation.  Prima facie this objection is not sustainable as the report of Medical Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons is on record and it clearly states that there was mal-alignment in the fracture fragments.  Clearly, this has led to shortening of the left leg by two inches and the same has been confirmed by the Medical Board. As the Medical Board constituted of Orthopaedic Surgeons, no better opinion can be obtained than from this Board.  It is not only the shortening of the left leg, but the patient also suffered for about more than one year with severe pain.  Thus, clearly, medical negligence on the part of the operating Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon, is proved.
17.    Coming to the deficiency on the part of Amar Hospital, owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon, it is clear that the record about the treatment and operation of the patient was not submitted before the Medical Board, even pre and post operation x-rays were not submitted before the Medical Board.  It has been alleged by the petitioner that the x-rays were given to the complainant along with discharge, however, the State Commission has given clear finding that there is no proof that these x-rays were handed over to the complainant. As the complainant suffered from pain and filed a consumer complaint, it is quite unlikely that he will not place these records before the Medical Board if he had the same.  Logically also, it is the discharge summary, which incorporates all the examinations and the treatment given but the test reports done by the hospital are generally kept with the hospital record.  Moreover, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Smt. Savita Garg Vs. The Director, National heart Institute, IV (2004) CPJ 40 (SC) held the following:-
“Once an allegation is made that the patient was admitted in a particular hospital and evidence is produced to satisfy that he died because of lack of proper care and negligence, then the burden lies on the hospital to justify that there was no negligence on the part of the treating doctor or hospital.  Therefore, in any case, the hospital is in a better position to disclose what care was taken or what medicine was administered to the patient.  It is the duty of the hospital to satisfy that there was no lack of care or diligence.  The hospitals are institutions, people expect better and efficient service, if the hospital fails to discharge their duties through their doctors, being employed on job basis or employed on contract basis, it is the hospital which has to justify and not impleading a particular doctor will not absolve the hospital of its responsibilities.”
18.    Thus, relying on the above observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as well as the fact that the medical record including important pre and post operation ex-rays were not provided by the petitioner to the Medical Board, the deficiency on the part of the hospital and consequently on the petitioner is also proved.
","19.    Based on the above discussion, I find that the State Commission has rightly decided medical negligence against both the petitioners herein.  Accordingly, I do not find illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 13.10.2010 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Consequently, the Revision Petition Nos.122 & 354 of 2011 are dismissed.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Ayush Choudhary, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Rit Arora, Advocate 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Smt. Savitri Devi, mother of the complainant, purchased a bond of scheme 010- option 2. The complainant was her nominee in respect of the said scheme. Shrimati Savitri Devi died on 06.04.2004. The complainant applied for grant of the death assistance payable to him under the scheme. The said death assistance having not been provided to him, he approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint filed on 04.11.2006. The amount of the bond, however, was paid to the complainant.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner which admitted the investment made by Shrimati Savitri Devi and took a preliminary objection that the complaint was barred by limitation. On merits, it was inter alia, stated in the written version that the bond amount was paid to the complainant in full satisfaction accepted by him. It was inter alia stated in the written version that the complainant had failed to prove that the bond holder was not suffering from any fatal/incurable disease within three years before purchasing the bond and, therefore, death assistance could not be provided.
3.      District Forum vide its order dated 22.03.2007 directed as under:-
“5. We have carefully gone through the entire facts and circumstances of the case and do find that this is fit case for the complainant to get the death help as provided by the terms and conditions of the schemes lodged by the O.P. Accordingly the O.P is directed to pay face value of the bond i.e. 1,000/- per month from the death i.e. 6-4-2002 in a lumpsum for accumulated period and further to pay monthly of Rs. 1,000/- for the total period of 10 years to the complainant he will also pay Rs. 2,000/- by way of compensation for harassment and cost of litigation within a month of the date of order.”
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum,  the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order 04.08.2014 the State Commission dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner. Being aggrieved the petitioner is before this Commission.
5.      The preliminary submission of the Ld. counsel for the petitioner is that the complaint when instituted was barred by limitation which commenced on the death of the bond holder. The complaint, according to him, ought to have been instituted within two years of her death. I, however,  find absolutely no merit in the contention. Though the amount of the bond was paid to the complainant the claim for grant of this assistance was never rejected. The cause of action to file the consumer complaint therefore continued to accrue in favour of the complainant even till the date on which the consumer complaint was actually instituted. Had the claim for grant of the death assistance been rejected the period of limitation would have commenced from that date but the death assistance having never been refused the complainant had a recurrent cause of action to approach the District Forum by way of a consumer complaint. In fact even the date on which the amount of the bond was disbursed to the complainant is not available with the Ld. counsel for the petitioner. Therefore, the complaint, in my view, cannot be said to be barred by limitation.
6.      The petitioner had taken another preliminary objection in its written version, alleging that the scheme in which deposit was made by the deceased was operated by the company namely Sahara India Commercial Corporation Limited and the petitioner was only an agent of the said company.
The submission of the Ld. counsel for the petitioner is that the petitioner was bad for non joinder of the company namely Sahara Commercial Corporation Limited. Though the petitioner claims to be an agent of the above-refereed company the submission of the Ld. counsel for the complainant is that the petitioner is an ‘Umbrella Organisation’ of Sahara India Group and controls the affairs of all companies of the group including the company referred above. A perusal of the written version filed before the District Forum would show that the petitioner contested the consumer complaint on merits questioning her entitlement to the death help. It clearly shows that the petitioner is integrally connected with the company namely Sahara Commercial Corporation Limited and forms part of the same group to which the said company belongs. In a consumer matter of this nature where the amount involved is very small and the complainant is the nominee of a very small investor it will not be appropriate to interfere with the concurrent order passed by the fora below in exercise of the revisional jurisdiction of this Commission when the matter was contested not only on preliminary issue but also on merits. Ultimately, the amount payable to the complainant in terms of the order passed by the Fora  below may come from the coffers of the concerned company which contested the consumer complaint through the petitioner organization. In fact the petitioner itself has stated in the Revision Petition that the bond was procured from it.  Therefore, I am not inclined to entertain the submission at this stage.
7.      As far as the merits of the case are concerned the clause pertaining to grant of death help in the event of the death of the account holder reads as under:-
(8) AFTER DEATH ASSISTANCE
On death o/ the Bond holder, nominated successor of the deceased Account Holder shall be entitled for assistance after death on the basis of following terms and conditions:-
(a) At the time of death, age of Bond holder should be between 15 years and 65 years.
(b) Death of Bond holder might have after 12 months/365 days of purchasing the Bond and before maturity period of the Bond.
(c) Cause of death of the Bond holder should not be due communal riots or any war.
(d) Cause of death of the Bond holder should not be due communal riots or any war.
(e) The Bond holder should have not suffered from any fatal/incurable disease continuously within 03 years prior to starting of Account. The nominated successor shall submit reliable and proved documents in this connection for obtaining assistance after death, which shall also accompany with the proof relating to Birth certificate of the Bond holder and death certificate to the satisfaction of company.
(9) AMOUNT OF AFTER DEATH ASSISTANCE
On the death of Bond holder, amount mentioned in the Bond shall be calculated with pre stage rate of interest, after adjustment of the secured loan borrowed by the Bond holder and interest accrued thereon, remaining amount shall be refunded by the company to the nominated successor of the Bond holder. Apart from this, 5% amount of the total value of Bond shall be payable as after death assistance to the nominated successor of the Bond holder as per rule. If death of Bond holder occurs any time after 12 months of purchasing the Bond, then 5% amount of the value of the Bond shall be payable to the nominated successor of the Bond holder upto period of 100 months. The nominated successor of the Bond holder may obtained facility of after death assistance only by furnishing his/her personal Bond. A period of 16 years shall be given for refunding after death assistance. No interest shall be charged on this amount and it shall not be necessary to refund this amount till five years of receiving after death assistance.”
8.      The Petitioner failed to show that the complainant was not entitled to the death assistance in terms of the clause contained in the scheme in which the deposit was made by the deceased. Though, the said amount was returnable to the company, it was not to carry and interest and was to be disbursed on the strength of the personal bond of the nominee of the depositor. This is nobody’s case that the complainant was not willing to execute the personal bond. In fact, the petitioner or for that matter the company namely Sahara Commercial Corporation Limited never offered the death assistance to the complainant. The complainant, therefore, has rightly been held entitled to the said death assistance.
9.      The Ld. counsel for the petitioner submits that appropriate surety should be asked from the complainant before asking them to disburse death assistance. Reliance is placed by the Ld. Counsel upon the decision of this commission in Sahara India Pariwar Vs. Pawan Kumar Jain I (2015) CPJ 721 (NC) wherein this Commission inter alia held as under:-
“6. It is contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner Company that the complaint ought to have been filed within two years from the date on which the sum of Rs. 14,000 was paid to the complainant and the said amount having been paid on 25.11.2004, the complaint filed on 18.12.2007 was clearly barred by limitation prescribed in Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act.
7. As far as limitation is concerned, we find no merit in the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the petitioner. While making payment of Rs. 14,000 to the complainant, the petitioner Company did not refuse to extend the Death Help Scheme to him. On receipt of the aforesaid amount, the complainant requested to the petitioner Company for payment in terms of the said Scheme. That prayer, however, was never rejected by the petitioner Company. Therefore, there is no merit in the contention that the period of limitation for the purpose of claiming benefit of Death Help Scheme would commence from the date of payment of Rs. 14,000 to the complainant.
8. It is next contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that in terms of Clause 8(f), the benefit under the Death Help Scheme is payable only if the bond holder is not suffering from any chronic or fatal disease within three years of the opening his account with the petitioner Company. However, in the case before us, there is no evidence of the deceased suffering from any chronic/fatal disease within three years from opening her account with the petitioner Company. Therefore, the benefit of the Death Help Scheme cannot be refused to her.
","9. The learned Counsel for the petitioner lastly submits that in terms of the second para of Clause 9 of the Scheme, the nominee is required to refund the amount received by it within a period of 16 years without paying any interest and such repayment would not be necessary within five years from the date of receiving the Death Help Scheme. The contention is justified. We, therefore, make it clear that the complainant would have to repay the amount which he would receive as a benefit under the Death Help Scheme, within the period of 16 years, though without any interest on that amount. He will also have to give personal guarantee in terms of para 2 of Clause 9 of the Scheme, while receiving the payment from the petitioner Company. The repayment would start after five years from the date of receiving the benefit and the entire amount would be paid by him in equal monthly instalments spread over a period of 11 years. The complainant shall also furnish the bank guarantee before the concerned District Forum after the petitioner Company has deposited the amount payable to him, before the said Forum. The personal guarantee would be handed over before the concerned District Forum to the petitioner Company and the amount deposited by it would then be released to the complainant. The revision petition stands disposed of accordingly.”
10.    In my opinion, in this matter there is no justification to ask the complainant, for the surety when the scheme itself requires to furnish only her personal bond. Asking for the surety would be contrary to the terms of the scheme and  possibly result in frustrating the grant of the assistance since being a poor person the complainant  may not be in a position to furnish the surety to the satisfaction of the petitioner.  In Pawan Kumar Jain (supra), the relevant scheme itself provided for personal surety of the nominee, but in this matter only personal bond is required.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the order of the Fora below does not call for any interference of this commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. Any interference by this Commission on the technical grounds advanced by the Ld. counsel for the petitioner will result in the failure of justice instead of advancing the same. The revision petition is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to cost.

  For the Respondent      :
","The Present Appeal Execution has been filed against the Order dated 18.02.2020, passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,  Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”), whereby the  IA/1120/2019 filed by the Appellant, who is one of the Judgment Debtor has been rejected  on the ground that even though warrant of arrest had been  issued against the present Appellant, instead of appearing in person, he has filed an Application for dismissal of Execution Case.
2.       We have heard Mr. M.P. Gupta, learned Counsel for the Appellant and perused the impugned Order passed by the State Commission.
3.       Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Decree has already been given effect to by the execution of Conveyance Deed and therefore nothing remains for the Execution, which ought to have been dismissed.
4.       We are not going into the merits of the case for the simple reason  that it is not in dispute that the State Commission had issued  Warrant of Arrest sometimes between 01.03.2019 and 13.11.2019 against all the Judgment Debtors and vide Order dated 13.11.2019, Warrant of Arrest against the Judgment Debtors No. 1 to 3, namely, Sri Subhasish Mukherjee, Sri Nivasish Mukherjee and Sri Debasish Mukherjee was recalled. However, for reasons best known, the present Appellant namely, Sri Sanjay Palangdar, who is the proprietor  of M/s. Tina Developer, Judgment Debtor No. 4 had not appeared. If the Warrant of Arrest has been issued by the State Commission, it is obligatory for the said person against whom the Warrant of Arrest has been issued to appear before the State Commission and cannot avoid his appearance by making any Application for dismissal of the case.
5.       The conduct of the present Appellant is such, which does not justify any favourable view. However, on the statement given by Mr. M.P. Gupta, learned Counsel for the Appellant that Mr. Sanjay Palangdar will appear before the State Commission on 29.04.2020, which is the date fixed before the State Commission in the Execution Case, we direct that the issue  and execution of Non Bailable Warrant of Arrest shall remain stayed till 29.04.2020, on which date as per the statement given by Mr. M.P. Gupta the learned Counsel, Mr. Sanjay Palangdar will appear.  If for any reason, he does not appear before the State Commission on 29.04.2020, the Non Bailable Warrant of Arrest may be executed. Further, if Mr. Sanjay Palangdar appears on 29.04.2020, before the State Commission, he shall be at liberty  to file a fresh Application before the State Commission, which shall be considered and decided in accordance with law. Mr. Sanjay Palangdar shall not be arrested till the Application which if filed on 29.04.2020 is decided by the State Commission and it will be open to the State Commission to consider whether he is required to appear on future dates or his personal appearance on future dates be exempted.
","6.       With the aforesaid observations, the Present Appeal Execution stands disposed of.

","1. The complainants/respondents booked residential apartments with the appellants in a project namely “Mantri Celestia”, which the appellants were to develop in Nanakramguda village of Ranga Reddy District (presently in Telangana).  On allotment of residential flats in the above referred project to them, they executed two agreements each with the appellants, one being the agreement and other being for the agreement for construction.  The possession of the allotted flats was to be delivered to the Complainants/Respondents by 01.07.2013 in F.A. No.1567/2019, by 31.05.2012 in F.A. No.1853/2019 and by 30.06.2013 in F.A. No.2136/2019.  The possession of the allotted flats was not delivered to them by the date stipulated in this regard.  The complainants therefore sought refund of the amount which they have paid to the appellant, with compensation etc.  The said refund having not been made, they approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking refund of the amount which they had paid to the appellants with interest, compensation etc.
2. The complaints were resisted by the appellants who admitted that the allotments made to the Complainants as well as the agreement executed with them.  The payment received from them was also not disputed.  It was however pleaded in the written version filed by the appellants that the construction of the residential complex was delayed on account of (i) civil commotion, strikes, agitations and public disturbances on account of the Telangana Agitation, (ii) flooding of the project site from the adjacent lake due to heavy rains, (iii) disruption in supply of cement, sand and other material on account of civil disturbances and (iv) migration of labour resulting in shortage of labour.
3. The State Commission vide impugned orders dated 28.06.2019, 07.08.2019 and 27.09.2019 directed refund of the amount which the Complainants had paid to the appellants alongwith interest @ 18% p.a. and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs.5,000/- in each case.
4. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellants are before this Commission by way of these separate appeals.
5. It is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that despite having noted the force majeure circumstances pleaded in the written version of the appellants, the State Commission didn’t return a finding on the said plea taken by the appellants and for this reason alone the impugned order is liable to be set aside.  It is also submitted by the learned Senior Counsel that the interest awarded by the State Commission is excessive and uncalled for, particularly when no evidence was led by the complainants to prove their actual loss except the interest which they had to pay on the loan taken by them.  It is also submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that they are ready to give possession of the allotted flats to the complainants since the construction had been completed and the appellants were in a position to deliver possession of the allotted flats even before the Consumer Complaints were instituted.
6. As far as the force majeure circumstances pleaded by the appellants are concerned, the said circumstances, in my opinion, didn’t stand established.  The possession of the allotted flats was required to be delivered in 01.07.2013 in F.A. No.1567/2019, by 31.05.2012 in F.A. No.1853/2019 and by 30.06.2013 in F.A. No.2136/2019.  Admittedly, the appellants were not in a position to offer possession prior to November, 2016 when the requisite occupancy certificates were obtained.  Therefore, there was delay for more than three years in completion of the project.  Though it was vaguely pleaded that the construction was delayed on account of civil commotion, strikes, agitations, no evidence was led to prove that any civil commotion, strikes, agitations had actually resulted in stoppage of work at the site of this project.  Moreover, the appellants have not even specified the particular period during which the construction of the project was allegedly delayed on account of civil commotion, strikes and agitations.  Though it was alleged that flooding of the project site from the adjacent lake due to heavy rains had also resulted in delay, no evidence of the project site having been actually flooded due to heavy water from the adjacent lake was produced.  Moreover, the appellants didn’t even disclose for how much period the project site remained flooded and the work could not be carried on account of flooding of the project site.  Though the appellants have pleaded disruption in supply of cement, sand and other material on account of civil disturbances, again no evidence was led to prove that cement, sand and other material was actually not available in the market and therefore the construction remained halted for want of said building material.  Though migration of labour was pleaded, no evidence was led to prove that the work labour was not available in the market despite the efforts made by the Appellants in this regard.  Therefore, the force majeure circumstances pleaded by the Appellants didn’t stand substantiated.
7. In GDA Vs. Balbir Singh (2004) 5 SCC 65, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inter alia, observed as under:
a)  As seen above, what is being awarded is compensation i.e. a recompense for the loss or injury. It therefore necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and has to correlate with the amount of loss or injury.
b)      Along with recompensing the loss the Commission/Forum may also compensate for harassment/injury, both mental and physical.
c)      That compensation cannot be uniform and can best be illustrated by considering cases where possession is being directed to be delivered and cases where only monies are directed to be returned. In cases where possession is being directed to be delivered the compensation for harassment will necessarily have to be less because in a way that party is being compensated by increase in the value of the property he is getting.  But in cases where monies are being simply returned then the party is suffering a loss inasmuch as he had deposited the money in the hope of getting a flat/plot.  He is being deprived of that flat/plot.  He has been deprived of the benefit of escalation of the price of that flat/plot.  Therefore, the compensation in such case would necessarily have to be higher.
In a recent decision, Fortune Infrastructure & Anr. vs. Trevor D'lima (2018) 5 SCC 442 the Hon'ble Supreme Court, referring to its decision in Balbir Singh (supra), inter alia, observed as under:
a)  It is now settled that where a party sustains loss by reason of a breach of contract, damages are to be granted so as to place the suffering party in the same position as if the contract had been performed.
8. As far as the quantum of compensation by way of interest is concerned, no evidence was led by the Complainants to prove the actual loss suffered by them on account of the appellants having failed to deliver the allotted units to them.  No evidence to prove the current market value of such residential flats was produced to prove that the actual loss suffered by the Complainants was more than the normal bank interest payable on the housing loan.  Moreover, the Complainants are not willing even today to accept the possession of the allotted flats which the Appellants are ready to offer to them. The learned Counsel for the Complainants in F.A. No.1567/2019 submits that the offer for possession has been made for the first time today before this Commission.  Even if this is so, the fact remains that even today, the Complainant are not willing to take possession of the allotted flats with a reasonable compensation.
9. It has come on record that the complainants had taken loans for the purpose of making payment to the Appellants.  Therefore, in all fairness they must get atleast the actual interest they have paid to the bank from which the loan was taken by them.  As far as the principal amount contributed by the Complainants from their own efforts is concerned, considering on the facts and circumstances including the prevailing rates of interest, the lack of evidence to prove the actual loss and the unwillingness the Complainants to take possession of the allotted flats, they should be paid compensation by way of simple interest @10% p.a. on the said amount.
","10. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of with the following directions:
(i) In all the three matters, the complainants shall be entitled to refund of the principal amount paid by them to the appellants.
(ii) In addition to the principal amount, the Complainants shall be entitled to interest at the rate actually paid by them to their bank on the loan which they had taken from their respective banks for making payment to the Appellants.  For this purpose, they will submit certificates from the bank, disclosing therein the principal amount of loan availed by them alongwith the interest they actually paid to the bank.  The penal interest, if any, on account of any default on the part of the Complainants in making payment shall not be reimbursed.
(iii) On the balance principal amount which the Complainants contributed from their own funds for making payments, they shall be paid compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% from the date of each payment till the date of refund.
(iv) The Complainants shall be entitled to Rs.25,000/- as the cost of litigation in each complaint.

  For the Appellant     :Mr Munish Goel, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr Sanjeev Goyal, Advocate 
","The present first appeal has been filed by Jagtar Singh against the order dated 04.06.2013 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in CC no. 82 of 2011.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the appellant’s trailer was insured with the respondent/ insurance company with effect from 10.04.2010 to 09.04.2011. The vehicle met with an accident  on 08.12.2010 while the driver wanted to save stray cattle, as the driver suddenly turned the vehicle it overturned and the diesel tank got fire. Fire brigade was called by the patrolling police. Complainant submitted a claim for total loss of the vehicle. The insurance company appointed surveyor who assessed the loss on repair basis for Rs.17,71,367/- and on total loss basis for Rs.21,96,400/-. However, the claim was repudiated by the insurance company vide their letter dated 10th August 2011. Complainant had filed the complaint before issuance of the repudiation letter. The complaint was resisted by the insurance company on the same grounds on which the claim was repudiated. It was stated that the trailer was over loaded with Bajri (Crushed stones). The State Commission has dismissed the complaint vide its order dated 04.06.2013.
3.     Hence, the present appeal.
4.     Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and pursued the record.
5.     Learned counsel for the appellant/ complainant stated that the insurance company had no proof that the vehicle was overloaded. In fact, the insurance company is relying on the endorsement on the receipt by the seller from whom the Bajri was purchased. However, the fact is that this endorsement has been taken by the investigator of the insurance company and this endorsement has been given by some other partner of the firm who may not be having the full knowledge of the weight. The fact is that the trailer was filled with Bajri within the limit prescribed. The surveyor has estimated loss at Rs.21,72,531/- and the same is based on total loss basis.
6.     It is further argued that the surveyor has not written anything in his report about the overloading. The issue of overloading is unnecessarily being raised by the insurance company just to deny the genuine claim of the complainant. The vehicle was never weighed and therefore, the correct assessment of the load of the vehicle cannot be done.
7.     On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent/ insurance company has stated that intimation of accident was given on 21.12.2010 to the insurance company. Thus there was delay of 13 days in giving intimation to the insurance company which is gross violation of the terms and conditions of the policy. Moreover, the vehicle was removed from the spot and no spot survey could be conducted by the insurance company. Clearly, no advantage of this fact could be given to the complainant as he has removed the vehicle from the spot without the permission from the insurance company or the surveyor. Since the load challan was not provided to the surveyor, therefore the surveyor has said nothing on over loading. Though the complainant is disputing the endorsement on the receipt given by the supplier, but the complainant has not filed any affidavit from the supplier contrary to this endorsement.
8.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record. The admitted fact is that the vehicle was insured with the respondent insurance company and the accident has occurred during the currency of the policy. Clearly, intimation to the insurance company was given on 21.12.2010 and the accident took place on 08.12.2010, thus there is a clear delay of 13 days in giving intimation to the insurance company and the complainant has violated the important condition of the policy that immediate intimation was required to be given to the insurance company. The insurance company has repudiated the claim on the basis of overloading of the trailer with Bajri and overloading has been claimed on the basis of endorsement made by the supplier on the receipt given by the seller to the purchaser. Though, this endorsement has also been questioned by the complainant by stating that the endorsement has been given by another partner whereas the receipt was signed by other partner. Clearly, if the complainant was so sure that the vehicle was not over loaded, the complainant could have filed an affidavit of the supplier either denying the endorsement or contradicting the endorsement. The complainant has not filed any such affidavit. In the absence of any contradicting assertion endorsement available on the receipt cannot be denied and has to be accepted. Thus, the State Commission has rightly given the finding that the trailer was overloaded.
9.     The State Commission has also examined whether the claim can be approved on ‘non-standard basis’. The State Commission has reached to the conclusion that overloading is that type of breach of condition which cannot be compromised for providing the claim on ‘non-standard basis’.  The surveyor in his report has stated that the vehicle was badly burnt out and most of the assemblies such as engine, gear box, chassis etc., got melted and required replacement.
10.   From the above, it is clear that the vehicle was totally burnt and it was a case of total loss. Otherwise also, the amount of loss on repair basis is more than 75% of the IDV of the vehicle, hence, this will be a case of total loss.  The surveyor has therefore assessed the loss at Rs.21,72,531/-. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Amalendu Sahoo Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., II (2010) CPJ 9 (SC) has observed that if certain condition of the policy is violated then the insurance claim can be settled on non-standard basis upto 75%. In the present case, two important conditions have been violated by the complainant; first, that the insurance company was not immediately informed about the accident and therefore, the insurance company could not get any opportunity to conduct spot survey and, the second, was in respect of overloading of the trailer. As the loss is genuine, I deem it appropriate to allow the insurance claim on 65% of the loss assessed by the surveyor which would be 65% of Rs.21,72,531/-,i.e., Rs.14,12,145/-.
11.   Based on the above discussion, the appeal is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission dated 04.06.2013 is set aside. The insurance company is directed to pay an amount of Rs.14,12,145/- along with 5% per annum interest from the date of filing of the complaint, i.e., 18.10.2011, in settlement of the insurance claim. This order be complied with by the Insurance Company within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt/ service of this order.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. K.S. Mahadevan, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. V. Pattabhi Ram, Advocate. 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainants had a demat account with the petitioner Integrated Enterprises India Ltd.  They were holding 100 equity shares of a company namely Sterlite Industries India Ltd.  The afore-said company namely Sterlite Industries India Ltd. came out with an offer of buy-back of its shares.  The case of the complainants is that no offer was received by them from the said company for buy-back of the shares and, therefore, they had no opportunity to either accept or decline the buy-back.  However, the shares were transferred from their demat account on the assumption that they had opted for the buy-back of shares.  Being aggrieved the complainants approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint impleading Integrated Enterprises India Ltd. as the only opposite party.  Sterlite Industries India Ltd. was not impleaded as a party to the complaint.
2.      The complaint was resisted on the ground that if the buy-back offer was not acceptable to the share-holder he was required to intimate so to the Registrar of the Company on or before 21.06.2002 failing which the share-holder was treated to have accepted the offer and that is why the shares were debited from the account of the complainants.
3.      The District Forum as well as the State Commission having held in favour of the complainants the petitioner is before this Commission.
4.      The only issue involved in this case is as to whether the complainants received buy-back offer from the company namely Sterlite Industries India Ltd.  or not.  This question cannot be decided in the absence of the impleading of Sterlite Industries India Ltd. The above-referred company was not impleaded as a party to the consumer complaint and, therefore, the Fora below had no  opportunity to decide the issue after hearing Sterlite Industries India Ltd.   The said company having not been impleaded to the complaint the Fora below were not justified in holding the petitioner company deficient in rendering the services to the complainants.
5.      The matter is quite old.  One option is to dismiss the complaint for non-joinder of a necessary party.  The other option is to give an opportunity to the complainants to implead Sterlite Industries India Ltd. and direct the District Forum to decide the complaint afresh after hearing the said company.  In the interest of justice, the complainants should be given an opportunity  to implead Sterlite Industries India Ltd. as a party to the consumer complaint.  The impugned orders are, therefore, set aside and the consumer complaint is remitted back to the District Forum for deciding the same afresh after impleading Sterlite Industries India Ltd. as a party to the complaint and asking the aforesaid company as to whether the buy-back offer was received by the complainant or not and whether they had responsed to the offer or not. The parties are directed to appear before the District forum on 31.07.2020.  Considering the age of the case the District Forum shall decide the complaint afresh with six months of parties appearing before it.
The learned counsel for the parties wants liberty to file some additional pleadings before the District Forum.  In my opinion no further opportunity is required.  The request is declined.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, MEMBER
1.      The Petitioners have filed these four Revision Petitions under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to challenge the impugned Order dated 24.11.2011 passed by the   State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Haryana, Panchkula which dismissed the First Appeal No. 581 of 2007 filed by the Complainants for enhancement of compensation and allowed the Appeals Nos. 620/2007, 641/2007 and 723/2007 filed by the Opposite Parties. As a result the Complaint was dismissed.
This common order shall decide these four Revision Petitions mentioned above. The facts are drawn from the Revision Petition No.937 of 2012. The Parties designated as placed in the Original Complaint No. 121 of 2003 filed before the   District Consumer Forum, Panchkula.
2.      Brief facts that, a practicing lawyer Mr. Bhushan Kumar Kochar   (since deceased, referred herein as ‘the patient’) suffered severe   pain and discharge in the perianal region. On 4.12.2002 he approached Shori Hospital, (OP-1) at Pinjore and got himself examined from Dr. Sandhu (OP-3) . The patient’s wife Smt. Veena Kochar (complainant no. 1) alleged that the OP-3 advised a minor small surgery for the perianal abscess and abdominal surgery (laparotomy) for appendicitis. On 5.12.2002 during laparotomy the anesthetist Dr.Sangeeta Shori (OP-2) and Dr.Sandhu (OP-3) noted pus in abdomen and it was not a case of appendicitis. There was gangrenous lesion also.  The patient became critical the doctors OP-2 & OP-3 expressed their helplessness due to lack of facilities at OP-1 hospital and therefore on the same day evening referred the patient to PGI, Chandigarh. But unfortunately non-availability of ventilators in PGI, the patient was taken to Fortis Hospital, Mohali. The complainant no. 1 further alleged that at the time of shifting from OP-1 hospital, the detailed discharge summary, history and medical record of patient were not given. The OP doctors concealed their negligence   who completely missed the diagnosis of ischeo-rectal abscess and performed wrong abdominal operation for appendicitis. Also, the OP-3 negligently put very small incision in the perianal region which did not help to remove large quantity of pus.  At Fortis hospital, the patient stayed for 12 days, underwent two operations (6.12.2002 and 11.12.2002). It was diagnosed as large abscess in the perianal region extending to the medial aspect of thigh causing necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum. The patient died on 12.10.2002 in Fortis Hospital. The Complainant no. 1 alleged medical negligence and deficiency in service against the OP-1 to 3 causing death of her husband. She and her minor children filed a Consumer Complaint before the District Forum, Panchkula for seeking compensation.
3.      The OPs filed their respective replies and denied their negligence during the patient’s treatment. The OP-1 to 3 submitted that the patient approached   OP-1 hospital in the morning on 04.12.2002 with severe pain and pus discharge from the perianal region. The patient was admitted and started IV fluids and higher antibiotics. Based on the clinical examinations and investigations, it was diagnosed as a case of septicemia with bilateral broncho pneumonia and ischeo-rectal fossa abscess with peritonitis. It was denied that the patient had appendicitis. The OP-3 is super specialized (MS,MCh.) having experience of 17 to 18 years. The patient was operated on 05.12.2002 by OP-3 with the anesthetist OP-2. During the operation, the collection of pus in the abdomen due to severe peritonitis noted. The Insurance Cos. OP-4, 5 and 6 in their written versions denied the negligence of the OPs 1 to 3. Their objection was that the Complaint was defective for non-joinder of parties as the Fortis Hospital was a necessary party, wherein patient stayed for 12 days and underwent two operations prior to his death.
4.      On the basis of pleadings and evidence on record, the District Forum accepted the Complaint and passed the following Order:
“8.     In the result the instant Complaint is hereby allowed and it is directed that-
The OPs No. 4 to 6 will pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/- towards medical treatment expenses;
The OPs No. 4 to 6 will also pay Rs. 1,00,000/- for mental agony and harassment to the Complainants;
Further, the OPs No. 4 to 6 will also pay a compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/- to the Complainants.
Also the OPs No. 1 to 3 will punitive damages of Rs. 5000/- and costs of Rs. 2000/- shall be paid in equal proportion by OPs No. 1 to 3.
The punitive damages will be deposited with the Accountant of this Forum for being deposited in the legal Aid Account and the costs shall be paid to the Complainants.
5.      Being aggrieved, the three Insurance Cos. (OP-4,5 & 6) have filed  separate Appeals (Appeal No. 620/2007,641/2007 and 723/2007) before the State Commission for setting aside the Order of District Forum  whereas the First Appeal No. 581/2007 filed by the Complainants for enhancement of compensation. The State Commission allowed the three Appeals filed by the OP Insurance Cos. and dismissed the appeal filed by the Complainants for enhancement and consequently dismissed the Complaint.
6.      Being aggrieved, two daughters and a son of the deceased have filed the instant four Revision Petitions.
7.      Heard the learned Counsel for Parties on both the sides. They have reiterated their affidavit of evidence filed before the District Forum. We have perused the entire material on record including the hospital record of OP-1, PGI Chandigarh and the Fortis Hospital, Mohali.
8.      The learned Counsel for the Complainants focused his argument on two counts.  One the OP-1 hospital caused negligence during operation and two the negligence in referral without furnishing medical history or record.
9.      We have carefully perused the indoor Bed Head Ticket of OP-1 hospital. It clearly shows that the patient was admitted in OP-1 at 7 AM on 04.12.2002. The OP-3 examined the patient and recorded the symptoms, signs and clinical findings. The patient was chronic alcoholic and very sick. There was diffuse abdominal tenderness, lungs showed bilateral crypts and bronchial breathing. The case was diagnosed as “Perianal abscess, Peritonitis? with Septicemia”.  The OP-3 advised to admit the patient with instruction for pre anesthetic checkup, consent and laboratory and radiological investigations, ECG etc. The patient was catheterized and treatment was started immediately with IV fluids, antibiotics (inj. Taxim, Metrogyl ), antacid (inj. Ranitidine), and analgesic (inj. Voveron).
10.    It is pertinent to note that the consent form was signed by Veena Kochar- wife of the patient and Dr. N. S. Sandhu. We find it contains all the ingredients of informed consent i.e. the diagnosis, procedural details, risks & benefits and signatures. The details of operative procedure of laparotomy and IR fossa abscess drainage for her husband were clearly mentioned. It was the case of peritonitis and severe sepsis, patient had severe abdominal pain and in early ARDS, therefore the patient was not in a condition to give consent. It was an emergency, the treating doctor obtained the consent from the wife of the patient.  In our considered view there was no illegality, it was a valid informed consent.
11.    It is clearly evident from the material on record that on 04.12.2002, the OP-3 initially treated the patient conservatively. The patient was in early chronic renal failure (CRF), the fluid correction was advised. As per surgical consultation, there was urgent need for drainage for abscess along with laparotomy. On the next day i.e. 05.12.2002 before surgery, the patient was re-assessed. The reassessment findings are reproduced as below:
“Date 05.12.2002           Reassessment
Patient has Ischiorectal fossa abscess leading to necrotizing fasciitis of perineum and abdomen wall. He is in septicemia with bronchopneumonia and early ARDS (Acute Respiratory distress Syndrome patient is also in early mild CRF (though urine output is adequate) he has remained afebrile and maintained his vital signs O/E he has feature of peritonitis in addition to the above problem. Pt needs surgery to drain the abscess as well as Lap in view of the peritonitis (needle aspiration showing purulent abdominal cavity fluid).
The relatives have been explained the high risk of the surgery involved and the facts that he might need ventilation post OP for which he will need to be referred to PGI/GMCH as the facility is not available here. The have also been given the option of taking the pt to these places, if they desire but they declined and preferred full faith in the ability of the doctors at Shori Hospital and want to get treatment here.
In view of this the patient being taken up for surgery here.”
Thus, in our view, the hospital and the treating doctors diagnosed the patient correctly and treated him as per the standard norms, we do not find any deficiency or negligence.
12.    After the reassessment OP-3 operated the patient in the evening on 05.12.2002 with the help of anesthetist OP-2. The Operative Notes are reproduced below:
“Date: 05.12.2002                     Operation Notes:
Dr. N.S. Sandhu Surgeon, Dr. Sangeeta Anesthetist
GA (General Anaesthesia)
SA via midline incision lap done
About 5 liters of foul smelling purulent fluid in the peritorial cavity along with exudates and flakes.
Extensive necrosis and gangrene of the anterior abdomen wall more on right side.
Necrosis originating with ischiorectal fossa extending perivrithrally, perineally, perivesically and extending upwards to the abdomen wall.
Thorough peritoneal toilet done and all loculation broken, all necrotic tissue removed, drain placed intra-abdominal right side with preperitonial layer (L) side in the subcutaneous tissue drain placed through the I.R. Fossa (Ishchiorectal Fossa) with the other end in preverical space.
Debridement perianal region done abdomen closed after checking haemostasis
At the end of the operation the patient was conscious but his breathing effort was shallow. So it was decided to shift him to PGI for ventilator support. The relatives have been explained the situation and prognosis.
Thus, it is apparent from the operative notes (supra) written by OP-3 nothing was mentioned about appendicitis. Therefore, the allegation of Complainants about wrong operation for appendicitis and missed the diagnosis of ischeo-rectal abscess   is not sustainable. After the operation patient became critical, had shallow breathing. Thus shifting of patient to PGI for ventilator support was correct decision of the doctors at OP-1. It was neither deficiency nor negligence, but it was reasonable practice and standard of practice.
13.   There is nothing on record to prove that OP-3 committed medical negligence while performing the operation. The Complainants failed to produce any Expert evidence, except the solitary affidavit Dr. S.M. Bose,   a Senior Consultant Surgeon in the Fortis Hospital who treated the patient (deceased). He stated that the patient was in-a state of shock when brought to the Fortis Hospital. The breathing was fast and there was difficulty in breathing. The patient was found to have a stitched wound on the abdomen and two drains on each side draining out foul smelling pus discharge. Also, noted a small incision on the right side of anal opening through which foul smelling pus was coming out. The District Forum has observed that one doctor in the emergency/casualty had talked Dr. Sangeeta (OP-2) who gave a brief summary of the case. Moreover, Dr. S. M. Bose nowhere stated that the treatment given by the OP-3 was improper or negligent.
14.    Before parting with this order, the another grouse of the Complainants  that the OP-1 hospital did not supply  the detailed discharge summary and medical record  to enable the doctors at Fortis Hospital to treat the patient more effectively.  We note from the pleadings of the OP-1 hospital that detailed in-patient record was not given. Only referral slip was given and  held the oral conversations between the doctors. We have perused the discharge summary of OP-1 hospital issued on its letterhead. It contains all the details like diagnosis, investigations and surgical treatment. It is evident that the patient was referred to PGI; Chandigarh wherein the doctors after going through the details in referral note, further referred him to Fortis Hospital due to non-availability of ventilators. Thus in our view the instant detailed discharge note was sufficient for management of emergency at Fortis hospital.  Moreover, in case of need the Doctor at referral hospital (in the instant case Fortis Hospital) shall call for treatment record from the previous hospital or Doctor.
15.    It is pertinent to note that nearly for 2½ years the OP-1 hospital did not file the medical record before the District Forum, till the evidence of Complainants’ was completed including examination of Dr. S.M. Bose. The Complaint was filed in May 2003 and the medical record (Ex.R1) was produced at the time of OP’s evidence in Aug/Sep 2005. The learned counsel for the Complainants relied upon the decisions of this Commission in RP/2605/2012 titled Dr. N.J. Karnavat v Patel Ishwarlal Mangalal & Ors. decided on 07.10.2014 and  FA/387/2010 titled K.Kotaiah Iras versus Dr. T. Anjaiah & Ors. which held the hospital liable for  the non-issuance of medical record. In our considered view   it was not sufficient that a referral slip was given or that there was oral conversation between the treating doctors of referring hospital and second hospital. It should be borne in mind that the referring hospital is duty bound to provide complete medical record to the second (referral) hospital. The OP-1 hospital failed to supply entire medical record despite request at the time of discharge and then after death of patient. It was the deficiency in service of OP-1 hospital which is also contrary to Art.1.3 & 7.2 of MCI Regulations/rules 2002. The Art 1.3.2 of the Regulation is reproduced below:
‘If any request is made for medical records either by the patients / authorized attendant or legal authorities involved, the same may be duly acknowledged and documents shall be issued within the period of 72 hours.’
16.    The medical record is a vital document and property of patient. It is mandatory for hospital/doctor to issue it to the patient / attendant on request. Thus, non-issuance of medical record was deficiency in service, and the OP-1 hospital is liable to that extent only.
17.    As   discussed (supra) there was no medical negligence in the instant case, but non-issuance of medical record was deficiency in service of OP-1. In our view, the deficiency was not fatal and not attributed to the cause of death of critically ill patient. The patient was in OP-1 hospital for 1 ½ days and thereafter 12 days in Fortis Hospital. The doctors at both the hospitals made their all efforts, but patient could not survive. Merely because a patient has not favorably responded or surgery has failed, the doctor cannot be held straightway liable for medical negligence. Similar view had been taken by Hon'ble Supreme Court in a number of cases in which medical negligence by the treating doctors / hospitals have been alleged.
18.    Based on the forgoing discussion in the given facts and the entire material on record before us, it is not feasible to attribute negligence on the OP-1 hospital and doctors OP-2 & 3. However, as discussed supra ( para 13,14 and 15) the OPs are held liable for deficiency in service in not providing the Medical Record of the patient specifically when the attendants of patient had demanded it and the Regulations of Medical Council of India provide for it. Accordingly, the OP- hospital is directed to pay lump sum of Rs. 100000/- to the Petitioners within six weeks from today, failing which the amount shall carry 10% interest till its realization. The Insurance Cos. shall comply the order promptly, if the OP Hospital availed the Insurance Cover.

1.      This Revision Petition No.570 of 2015 seeks modification of the order of the State Commission in F.A. No.1196 of 2014.  The impugned order is as below:
“Present :- Mr. Sunil Narang, Advocate for the appellants
                 This case has been taken up before this Bench because Sh. R.K. Bishnoi, Judicial Member, Additional Bench is on leave today.
HDFC Bank is in appeal against the order dated 05th November, 2014 passed by District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Bhiwani.
Learned counsel for the appellants has urged that amount of the demand draft was Rs. 1,17,357/- as slated in the complaint but the District Forum directed the appellants to pay Rs.1,57,357/- that may be due to clerical mistake.
Notice be issued to the respondents by registered post acknowledgment due for 03.03.2015.
Record of the District Forum be called for.
In the meanwhile, implementation of the impugned order is stayed to the extent that appellants shall pay Rs.1,17,357/- alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum granted by the District Forum and Rs.2200/- as litigation expenses.""
2.      Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that there has obviously been a clerical error in the order of the District Forum which has directed a payment of Rs.1,57,357/- instead of Rs.1,17,357 as it was this discrepancy which was also inter alia the reason for appeal.
3.      It is against this impugned order of the State Commission that this revision petition has been filed.
4.      There is only a very short point involved in this revision petition.  It is unclear in the State Commission’s order whether Rs.1,17,357/- with interest @ 12% p.a. and Rs.2200/- as litigation expenses was to be deposited in the District Forum or whether they were directing the amount be paid to the respondent/complainant. Further, at the time this RP was admitted in the National Commission, vide order dated 16.3.2015, the petitioner had been directed to deposit the entire awarded amount along, within four weeks, with the District Forum while granting stay to the execution of the impugned order.
5.      This then is the position of this particular case at present.
6.      It is obvious that there was an error apparent in the impugned order of the State Commission, as it had not clearly stated whether the payment of Rs. 1.17,357/- was to be made to the complainant or towards deposit in the District Forum.
","7.      In view of above, this revision petition is allowed with the direction that the matter be remanded to the State Commission for it’s disposal on merit after hearing the parties. As the matter has already been delayed, the State Commission is further requested to decide the appeal on an expeditious basis.
8.      With the above, this revision petition stands disposed off.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant / respondent No.1 allegedly visited a Multiplex in Vijayawada to watch a film. In the theatre, a bottle of Kinley water was sold to him for Rs.50/-, a 400 ml Minute Maid pulpy orange was sold to him for Rs.60/- and a cane of Diet Coke  was sold to him for Rs.100 though the regular price of these products was Rs.20/-, Rs.30/- and Rs.30/- respectively. He therefore, alongwith Consumer Guidance Society, filed a consumer complaint,  alleging that the petitioners were indulging in unfair trade practice, besides violating  the provision of Legal Metrology Act, 2009.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioners who interalia stated in their reply that the water and beverages sold in the theatres were specially manufactured and packed for sale in the theatres and they were selling the same at the MRP printed on such packages. It was also stated by them that the viewers were under no compulsion to purchase in the theatres.
3.      The District Forum disposed of the consumer complaints with the following directions:-
“1. The opposite party No.4 (Multiplex) have to refund the excessively charged Rs.130/- with an interest of 9% from the date of complaint to the complainant No.1.
2. The opposite parties 1 to 3 jointly (i.e. cold drink Companies) pay Rs.5,000/- as compensation to the complainants.
3. The opposite parties 1 to 3 (i.e. cold drink companies) are to pay Rs.5,00,000/- to the State Consumers Welfare Fund as penalty for formulating and implementing the Dual MRP and in the process for earning huge illegal profits.
4. The opposite party No.4 (Multiplex) is directed to make available in their premises. Acquafina, Kinley and Bisleri, etc., the products of opposite parties 1 to 3 (i.e. cold drink companies) for sale at the rates that are prevalent in the general market so that the right to choose by the consumers is respected. In accordance with Rule 6 of legal metrology, price list has to be prominently displayed with the details pertaining to Manufacture's name and address, weight/quantity, month of manufacturing with year and MRP, etc. which can be visible to consumers.
5. The opposite party No.4 (Multiplex) shall provide free drinking water facility at more accessible places for convenience of consumers.
6. The opposite party No.4 (Multiplex) shall allow the consumer to carry packaged water, cold drinks and eatables into the multiplex.
7. The opposite party No.5 (Controller, Legal Metrology) shall enforce all the said measures which are meant for opposite party No.4 (Multiplex) upon all other Multiplexes and cinema theatres though they have not been made parties in the present complaint.
8. The opposite party No.5 (Controller, Legal Metrology) shall ensure that the multiplex cinema theatres throughout the state shall display the boards comprising the details of the Officer responsible for the redressal of the disputes pertaining to weights and measures with his mobile number, whatsapp or email id prominently visible to the consumers.
9. The opposite party No.5 (Controller, Legal Metrology) shall ensure by taking appropriate action, that all the packaged commodities which are on sale shall carry all the details as described under Legal Metrology (Package Commodity) Rules, in all the multiplex cinema theatres throughout the state.
10. The opposite party No.5 (Controller, Legal Metrology) shall register the complaints in every district regarding the Dual MRP and accordingly take action within the stipulated time frame and he is to maintain all the records for examination.
The opposite parties 1 to 5, Cold drink Companies, Multiplex, Controller, Legal Metrology are hereby ordered to comply with above orders within two months from the date of order.”
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the petitioners approached the concerned State Commission by way of appeals. The said appeals are still pending. The only grievance of the petitioners in these petitions  is that the State Commission while staying other directions given by the District Forum qua the petitioner has not stayed the second part of Direction No.4 and has also not stayed Direction No.6.
5.      The second part of Direction No.4 required the petitioner to display the price list with details such as manufacturer’s name and address, weight / quantity, month of manufacturing with year and MRP, etc. Direction No.6 required the petitioner to allow the viewers to carry packaged water, cold drinks and eatables in the multiplex.
6.      As rightly pointed out by the learned Sr. Counsel for the petitioner Rule 6 of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011 applies to the manufacturer  of the packaged goods and requires them to display the particulars given in the said Rule including the name and address of the manufacturer, the net quantity, the month and year of manufacture and real price of the package. The State Commission, therefore, ought to have stayed the Second Part of the 4th direction during pendency of the appeals.
7.      As far as Direction No.6 is concerned, the following was the view taken by this Commission in Revision Petition No.3972 of 2014 - Rupasi Multiplex, Post Office, Chowmuhani, Agartala Vs. Mautusi Chaudhuri & Ors., decided on 19.9.2014:-
“6.       We are in agreement with the learned counsel for the petitioner that the security considerations may prevail upon the cinema owners to prohibit carrying of drinking water from the market inside the cinema hall.  Sometime undesirable elements may carry alcoholic drinks or even water mixed with acid inside the cinema halls.  There have been reports on bottle bomb devices exploding at theatres leading to evacuation of the theatres. In our opinion, a cinema hall, which seeks to prohibit carrying of drinking water inside the cinema hall for security reasons, must necessarily provide free portable and pure drinking water through water coolers installed inside the cinema halls, before such a prohibition can be enforced.  An appropriate water purifiers such as Aqua-guards, needs to be installed with the water coolers so that the water available to the cinema-goers free from the impurities.  Disposable glasses in sufficient quantity need to be kept available near the water coolers.  It has also to be ensured that the water supply is actually available through the water coolers before the movie starts as well as throughout the screening of the movie including interval.  If for any reason, water supply is not available on a particular day, alternative arrangements for supply of free pure and portable drinking water to the cinema-goers needs to be made available by the owners of the cinema hall. The cinema hall is also required to ensure that the water coolers as well as water purifiers remain fully functional and are regularly serviced from time to time so that only purified water is dispensed through the coolers.   If this is not done, the owner of the cinema hall would be liable to pay appropriate compensation for the deficiency in rendering services to the cinema-goers.  Mere availability of the drinking water from the cafeteria, in our view, would not be sufficient to enforce prohibition of carrying drinking water inside the cinema halls.”
8.      The learned counsel for the petitioner states on instructions that the petitioner has been complying with the Direction No.5 of the State Commission which requires them to provide free drinking water at more accessible places for convenience of the consumers.
9.      Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, Direction No.6 and the second part of Direction No.4 issued by the District Forum shall remain stayed during pendency of the appeals before the State Commission provided that the drinking water made available by the petitioners in the cinema halls is free, potable and pure, it is supplied through water coolers/dispensers installed in the theatres and an appropriate water purifier is installed with the water coolers so that the water available to the cinema goers is free from impurities. Disposal glasses in sufficient quantity also have to be made available all the time near the water coolers and it has to be ensured that the water supply through the water coolers  is available throughout the screening of the movie including intervals. If for any reason water supply through water coolers is not available on a particular day, alternative arrangements for supply of free, pure and potable drinking water to the cinema goers has to be made by the petitioner who has to keep the water coolers as well as the water purifiers fully functional and regularly serviced from time to time.
","10.    The revision petitions stand disposed of accordingly. Considering the general importance of the issue involved in these petitions, the State Commission is directed to decide the appeals within a period of three months from the next date of hearing fixed before it.

  For the Respondent      :
","PER MR. PREM NARAIN,  PRESIDING MEMBER
This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Ministry of Railways against the order dated 24.09.2018 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.487 of 2017.
2.      Brief facts relevant for disposal of the present revision petition are that the respondent/complainant filed a consumer complaint before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum –VI, Distt. New Delhi, (in short ‘the District Forum’) bearing complaint No.639 of 2013 in respect of the deficiency against the petitioner herein/opposite party.  The District Forum vide its order dated 03.04.2014 directed the petitioner herein/opposite party to pay a compensation of Rs.75,000/- to the complainant.
3.      The complainant preferred an appeal bearing no.556 of 2014 before the State Commission and the petitioner herein contested that appeal.  The appeal was decided vide order dated 24.05.2017.
4.      Petitioner also preferred appeal no.487 of 2017 before the State Commission.  The State Commission has dismissed this appeal on the ground of limitation.
5.      Hence the present revision petition.
6.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at the admission stage. Learned counsel argued that the order of the District Forum awarding Rs.75,000/- as compensation to the respondent/complainant is not justified at all and particularly the order relating to deduction of Rs.25,000/- from the salary of the concerned TTE. The State Commission has dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner herein on the ground of limitation.  The fact is that the petitioner herein was proceeded ex-parte before the District Forum as the complainant had given wrong address of the opposite party.  This point has been raised before the State Commission in appeal, however, the State Commission has not considered anything on merit and has dismissed the appeal on the ground of limitation only.  The learned counsel argued that the delay has occurred because the petitioner herein was proceeded ex-parte before the District Forum and therefore, the petitioner herein got the information of the order of the District Forum only when notice was issued in the appeal filed by the respondent/complainant.  It is stated by the learned counsel that the petitioner herein was already contesting the appeal filed by the respondent/complainant before the State Commission and therefore, no need was felt to file the appeal by the petitioner herein before the State Commission against the same impugned order of the District Forum.  As the delay is bonafide and unintentional, the delay should have been condoned by the State Commission as the petitioner herein had merit in its appeal.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and have examined the record.  Special periods of limitation have been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for speedy disposal of consumer disputes as held by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, IV (2011) CPJ 63 (SC) as follows;
“It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this Court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Foras.”
8.   Decision of Anshul Aggarwal (Supra) has been reiterated in CicilyKallarackal  Vs. Vehicle Factory, IV (2012) CPJ 1(SC) 1, wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court observed:-
“4. This Court in Anshul Aggarwal v. NOIDA, (2011) CPJ 63 (SC) has explained the scope of condonation of delay in a matter where the special Courts/ Tribunals have been constituted in order to provide expeditious remedies to the person aggrieved and Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is one of them. Therefore, this Court held that while dealing with the application for condonation of delay in such cases the Court must keep in mind the special period of limitation prescribed under the statute (s).
5.     In the instant case, condoning such an inordinate delay without any sufficient cause would amount to substituting the period of limitation by this Court in place of the period prescribed by the Legislature for filing the special leave petition. Therefore, we do not see any cogent reason to condone the delay.
","6.       Hence, in the facts and circumstance of the case as explained hereinabove, we are not inclined to entertain these petitions. The same are dismissed on the ground of delay”.
9.      In R.B. Ramlingam Vs. R.B. Bhavaneshwari, 2009 (2) Scale 108, the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed:-
“We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition”.
10.   It is admitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the same is also proved from the record that the District Forum passed the ex-parte order on 03.04.2014. The respondent/complainant preferred appeal no.556 of 2014 before the State Commission, which was contested by the petitioner herein.  Thus, the petitioner got the information about the order of the District Forum while contesting the appeal filed by the respondent/complainant.  If the petitioner was aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the same should have been challenged when the information of the order of the District Forum came to the notice of the petitioner.  This appeal has been filed on 03.08.2017 after the decision of the State Commission in appeal no.556 of 2014 filed by the respondent/complainant, which was decided on 24.05.2017. Thus, clearly the petitioner has waited for the decision in the appeal filed by the respondent/complainant, which was not the correct legal action taken by the petitioner.  The petitioner should have filed the appeal within a period of 30 days after getting the information regarding ex parte order of the District Forum dated 03.04.2014.  Thus, in the present case, no ground is made out for condoning the delay in filing the appeal preferred by the petitioner herein before the State Commission.  The above referred judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court are fully applicable in the present case and negligence and deliberate inaction are imputable to the petitioner in filing the appeal before the State Commission. The petitioner has not shown reasonable diligence in the prosecution of their appeal. Hence, the State Commission has rightly dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner herein on the ground of limitation as there was a delay of more than 3 years in filing the appeal
11.   Based on the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 24.09.2018 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Accordingly, the revision petition No.3418 of 2018 is dismissed at the admission stage.

I have heard  the Ld. counsel for the respondent as well as the Petitioner who has appeared in person along with the Ld. Amicus Curiae.
A residential flat bearing No. 4571/C in Sector 70 of Mohali was allotted by the respondent to one Ashok Kumar Garg.  He entered into an agreement to sale dated 27.10.1999 with one Anuresh Sharma s/o Sukhdev Sharma, in respect of the afore-said flat and also executed a power of attorney dated 28.10.1999 in favour of Rakesh Sharma and Sunita Sharma, son and daughter respectively of late Sh. Sukhdev Sharma.  The allotment was cancelled by the Estate Officer on 17.06.2009 and the cancellation was upheld by the revisional and appellate authorities.
2.      The petitioner/complainant filed a consumer complaint against the respondent making several allegations against the respondent and seeking compensation amounting to Rs.10,00,000/-.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the respondent which took a preliminary objection that the complainant was not a ‘consumer’ of the respondent, she being only an attorney of the original allottee.  It was also stated in the reply that unauthorized construction had been made in the flat and the allotment had been rightly cancelled.
4.      The District Forum vide its order dated 29.04.2013, directed as under:-
“Necessary steps for removing the material defects in the construction or design on the complex in which the fiat of the complainant is located includes providing amenities like access, to the top floor i.e. terrace are well meaning and deserves to be looked into by the OPs for the safety and security of the life of the residents of the complex Therefore, complaint of the complainant is partly accepted with the direction to the op to complete that exercise within the time frame i.e. within three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order, certified copies of the order be furnished to the parties forthwith free of costs and thereafter the file be consigned to the record room.”
5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District forum the respondent approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order dated 03.11.2014 the State Commission allowed the appeal and dismissed the consumer complaint primarily on the ground that the complainant was not a ‘consumer’ of the respondent. Being aggrieved from the order of the State Commission the complainant/petitioner is before this Commission.
","6.      This revision petition was filed in the year 2014.  After filing this revision petition, Civil Writ Petition No. 19692 of 2015 was filed by the petitioner against the respondent and the original allotee Sh. Ashok Kumar Garg before the Hon’ ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana.  The afore-said writ petition was disposed of by a Division Bench of the Hon’ble High Court vide order dated 04.10.2015 with the following directions:-
3) Having heard learned counsel for the parties and the stand taken by GMADA through its counsel Mr. Naresh Prabhakar, it appears that some unauthorized construction raised in the subject flat is not compoundable and the authorities are inclined to restore and transfer the same in favour of petitioner or other transferee provided that non-compoundable unauthorized constructions are removed and further subject to fulfillment of other prescribed conditions.
4) The petitioner has explained some genuine difficulties like perennial seepage in the roof top of the flat for which she had to install make-shift stair-cases for carrying out the repairs. Some of the alterations made by her are essentially to keep the dwelling unit worth habitable, hence we direct the GMADA authorities to carry out a fresh inspection of the subject flat as well as all other flats in the same building/vicinity and thereafter take a holistic view as to what type of additions/alterations can be included amongst the compoundable and can be regularized for better living conditions of the occupants. Similarly, the inspecting team shall re-visit the site to find out as to how much unauthorized constructions can be regularized on deposit of compounding fee. The additions/alterations permitted to be retained/carried out would obviously be keeping in view the element of inconvenience likely to be caused to the occupants of ground floor or first floor of the building as well as the overall safety of the buildings.
(5) After such fresh inspections, if it is found that any part of the unauthorized construction cannot be made compoundable, in any circumstances, the petitioner shall have to remove that part of the unauthorized construction and (i) on removal of such unauthorized construction; (ii) on deposit of the requisite fee for transfer of the flat; (iii) on deposit of the compounding fee in respect of the constructions which are found compoundable; or (iv) on submission of other requisite documents as required by the authorities, the GMADA is directed to restore and transfer the flat in favour of the petitioner.
(6) The inspection team shall comprise (i) the Senior Architect of PUDA; (ii) the Assistant Town Planner from the Town and Country Pleinning Department; and (iii) the Sub Divisional Engineer, who shall carry out the inspection within one month. The petitioner shall be required to comply with the inspection report to the extent of removal of non-compoundable constructions within two months and after doing so, she may submit the documents/fee etc. as directed above within one month thereafter. The authorities shall then pass an appropriate order for restoration/transfer of flat within two months. If the inspecting team is of the view that stair-cases cannot be permitted to be retained, in that event, it shall be the sole responsibility of GMADA/PUDA to carry out necessary repairs on the roof top and ensure that there is no seepage into the top floor flats. The authorities shall also ensure and will issue appropriate directions to the residents to upkeep the roof top/water tanks and/other amenities.
7.      It is an admitted position that the above-referred flat has not been transferred in the name of the complainant/petitioner till date.  The Ld. counsel for the respondent submits that this could not be done as the complainant failed to comply with the conditions imposed by the Hon’ble High Court.
8.      Since the flat in question has not yet been transferred in the name of the complainant she is not a ‘consumer’ of the respondent as on today.  If the respondent has wrongly not transferred the flat in her name in terms of the directions issued by the Division Bench of the Hon’ble High Court she has to approach the Hon’ble High Court for appropriate relief.  As far as a consumer forum is concerned, it does not have jurisdiction to grant relief to a person who is not a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act.  Since the flat in question has not yet been transferred in the name of the complainant, no relief to her can be granted by this Commission.  The revision petition is, therefore, disposed of by directing that if and when the flat in question is transferred by the respondent in favour of the petitioner/complainant she will be entitled to avail such remedies as are available to her in law including a complaint before a Consumer Forum in terms of the Consumer Protection Act. The revision petition stands disposed of accordingly.
9.      The registry is directed to pay the fees of the amicus curiae, if not already paid, as per the guidelines adopted by this Commission.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER HON'BLE MR. C. VISWANATH,MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Chandrashekhar A Chakalabbi, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","These revision petitions have been filed by the petitioner Savita Kom Nataraj Naragund & ors. against the common order dated 21.06.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Karnataka, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal Nos.2168-2176 and 2178- 2189 of 2016 filed by the petitioners herein against the orders of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Uttar Kannada at Karwar, (in short ‘the District Forum’) passed in CC Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 of 2014.  As the issue is same in all the revision petitions and the impugned order is also similar in nature, these revision petitions are being decided together.
2.      The brief facts of these cases are that the petitioner is the wife of the erstwhile partner of a firm namely, Gajanan Finance Corporation. The partnership firm took amounts from the respondents/complainants for fixed deposit to be issued by the firm.  The fixed deposit receipts were also issued to the respondents. However, the payments were not made by the firm on the date of maturity of these fixed deposits. Accordingly, the respondents/complainants filed consumer complaints with the District Forum being  CC Nos. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46 of 2014. These complaints were resisted by the petitioners by filing the written statement in each case, however, the District Forum allowed the complaints by passing the following order:-
“The complaint nos.25/2014, 26/2014, 27/2014, 28/2014, 29/2014,
30/2014,31/2014,32/2014,33/2014,34/2014,35/2014,36/2014,37/2014,38/2014,39/2014,40/2014,41/2014,42/2014,43/2014,44/2014,45/2014 and 46/2014 are allowed in part with cost.
The OPs are hereby directed to pay jointly and severally to the complainant-
1. In CC No.25/2015 Rs.6,52,937/- towards S.B.A./C balance amount.
2.   In CC No.26/2014 Rs.1,80,000/- in CC No.27/2014 Rs.1,60,000, in CC No.28/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.29/2014, Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.30/2014, Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.31/2014, Rs,1,80,000/-, in CC No.32/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.33/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.34/2014, Rs.90,000/- in CC No.35/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.36/2014, Rs.,80,000/-, in CC No.37/2014, Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.38/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, inCC No.39/2014, Rs.90,000/- in CC No.40/2014 Rs.1,80,000/-, in CC No.41/2014 Rs.1,60,000/-, in CC No.42/2014 Rs.40,000/-. In CC No.43/2014 Rs.90,000/-, in CC No.44/2014, Rs.90,000/-, and in CC No.46/2014 Rs.90,000/-, toward FDs maturity amount with interest @12% pa in respect of CC No.26/2014 to 46/2014 and in CC No.25/2014 from the date of last entry at Ex.C-1 till the date of deposit of the amount before the Forum.OPs are granted for one month time for depositing the amount before the Forum from the date of receipt of this order.
3. The liability in respect of OP-2 to 5 is restricted to the estate of late Nataraj J. Nargund in their hands.  The liability of OP-10(a) to (d) is also similarly to the estate of deceased OP-10 in their hands.
4.       The OPs also hereby directed to pay to the complainants a sum of Rs.10,000/- towards compensation in each case.
5.       The OPs also hereby directed to pay to the complainants a sum of Rs.2,000/- towards cost in each case.”
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioners herein preferred appeals being FA Nos.2168 to 2189 of 2016 before the State Commission.  The State Commission vide its order dated 21.06.2019 dismissed these appeals.
4.      Hence the present revision petitions.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners at the admission stage.  Learned counsel stated that the amounts were deposited as investment by the respondents/complainants and therefore, the transactions were of commercial nature.  The cases of the respondents are not covered under the explanation attached to Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and therefore, the complainants were not maintainable before the District Forum as the transactions were for commercial purpose.  Learned counsel referred to the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Punjab University Vs. Unit Trust of India and others, (2015) 2 SCC 669, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed the following:-
“21. It is thus seen from the above extracts from Laxmi Engg. Works that Section 2(1) (d)(i) is discussed exclusively by this Court.  We are of the opinion that clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 2(1)(d) of the Act must be interpreted harmoniously and in light of the same, we find that the Explanation following Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act would be clarificatory in nature and would apply to the present case and as held by this Court in Laxmi Engg. Works, the term “commercial purpose” must be interpreted considering the facts and circumstances of each case.”
6.      On the basis of the above judgment, it was stated by the learned counsel that FDRs were purchased for investment purpose and for earning profits and therefore, the complainants/respondents are not the consumers. Hence the orders passed by the fora below are illegal are required to be set aside.
7.      It was stated that the fora below also failed to appreciate that the criminal proceedings initiated by the complainants have resulted in the investigating officer filing a ‘B’ report which is indicative of the fact that there was no material against the petitioners.
8.       It was further stated that both the fora below ought to have appreciated that Mr. Nataraj was the face of the partnership firm and only upon his death that the claims have been made by the complainants.  There was no explanation for the complainants for not raising claims any time before the death of Mr. Nataraj.  The complainants have clearly taken advantage of the death of the important person in the partnership firm by filing the present complaints.
9.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners and examined the record. The banking services are covered under Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Section 2(o) reads as under:-
“2(o)   “service” means service of any description which is made available to potential [users and includes, but not limited to, the provision of] facilities in connection with banking, financing insurance, transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or both, [housing construction] entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service;”
10.    Therefore, a person can file complaint under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for the deficiency in service for a service provided by a bank or a financial institution. Moreover, this Commission in  Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. CTJ 141 (CP) (NCDRC), has taken a view that the banking services are covered under the Consumer Protection Act 1986.  It has been held:-
“18. Further, what is commercial purpose is discussed by the Apex Court in various decisions.
19.     We would refer to few relevant judgments:
In Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Vs. Shiv Kumar Joshi, (2000) 1 SCC 98, the Court elaborately considered the provisions of Sections 2(1)(d) and 2(1)(o) as well as earlier decisions and held that-
“The combined reading of the definitions of “consumer” and “service” under the Act and looking at the aims and object for which the Act was enacted, it is imperative that the words “consumer” and “service” as defined under the Act should be construed to comprehend consumer and services of commercial and trade-oriented nature only. Thus any person who is found to have hired services for consideration shall be deemed to be a consumer notwithstanding that the services were in connection with any goods or their user. Such services may be for any connected commercial activity and may also relate to the services as indicated in Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.”
21. The aforesaid ratio makes it abundantly clear that services may be for any connected commercial activity, yet it would be within the purview of the Act.
29. Further, from the aforesaid discussion, it is apparent that even taking wide meaning of the words ‘for any commercial purpose’ it would mean that goods purchased or services hired should be used in any activity directly intended to generate profit. Profit is the main aim of commercial purpose. But, in a case where goods purchased or services hired in an activity which is not directly intended to generate profit, it would not be commercial purpose.”
11.    In Canara Bank Vs. M/s. Jain Motor Trading Company & Anr., F.A. No. 432 of 2008, decided on 29.07.2013; this Commission has held as follows:
“10.    We also do not accept the contention of Counsel for Appellant/Bank that Respondent being a commercial firm is not a ‘consumer’ as per the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Commercial concerns per se are not excluded from filing a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 if it does not involve direct generation of profits or resale.  Also as stated in the instant case, the OCC facility was sought from Appellant/Bank to help resolve the financial difficulties being faced by Respondent which was not per se a commercial activity generating profits.  As pointed out by Counsel for Respondent, these aspects are well settled in a number of judgments, including of this Commission as also of the Hon’ble Supreme Court e.g. Harsolia Motors Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [I (2005) CPJ 27 (NC)] and Madan Kumar Singh Vs. Distt. Magistrate, Sultanpur [(2009) 9 SCC 79].”
12.    From the above decisions, it is amply clear that a person availing the services of a bank is a consumer and can file a consumer complaint before the consumer forum for the deficiency on the part of the bank.
13.    It has been argued by the learned counsel that the criminal proceedings initiated by the complainants have not resulted into any action against the petitioners.  It is an accepted principle of law that the criminal liability and the civil liability are two different aspects of liability.  The learned counsel has only stated that the investigating officer has filed a ‘B’ report.  It is not clear whether the report has been accepted by the competent criminal court.  Even if there is no criminal liability, the civil liability may remain and can be decided.  It has been argued by the learned counsel that Mr. Nataraj was the main partner of the partnership firm and the claim has been filed after his death and the complainants have taken advantage of his death.  It is not the case of the petitioners that the claims are fraudulent.  In fact, a partnership firm is not a legal person and the partners are responsible for any act or omission on the part of the partnership firm.  Hence, the liability clearly devolves on the partner and thus, it will also extend to the LRs of the partner if expired.  Thus, from this angle also, we do not find any merit in the revision petitions preferred by the petitioners.
","14.    Based on the above discussion, we do not find any merit in the revision petitions as no illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error is found in the order dated 21.06.2019 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Accordingly, the revision petition Nos.307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317,318,319,320,321,322,323,324,325,326 and 327 of 2020 are dismissed at the admission stage.

For the Respondent No.3:     nemo (served) 
","Revision petition No.122 of 2011 has been filed by the petitioner Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon and Revision Petition No.354 of 2011 has been filed by the petitioner Dr. K.N.S.Dhillon, against the order dated 13.10.2010 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.1286 of 2004.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1/complainant (since deceased and now represented by the LRs.) got his operation done in Amar Hospital, owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon.  The patient remained admitted in Amar Hospital from 11.06.2002 to 22.06.2002 and the operation was performed and plate was fixed.  On 11.12.2002 x-ray was done again and it was found that the deceased was not completely cured.  Again in October, 2003, the x-ray was done and the pain also persisted. By that time the doctor, who had performed the operation had opened his own clinic and he removed the plate.  There was a shortening of about 2 inches in the left leg.  A complaint was filed before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ferozepur, (in short ‘the District Forum’) and the District Forum vide its order dated 17.09.2004 allowed the complaint as under:-
“40  In view of what has been discussed above, this complaint is dismissed against opposite party No.1 without any order as to costs and is accepted against opposite party No.2 with costs of Rs.2,000/- and is directed to pay a sum of Rs.75,000/- to the complainant, which he approximately spent on his treatment, which turned to be futile due to the deficiency in service on his part.  He is also directed to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the complainant as compensation for his mental harassment as his treatment has lingered on as a result of deficiency in service on the part of opposite party No.2.  This order is directed to be complied with within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of its copy.  Copies of this order be communicated to the parties concerned free of costs.”
3.      Aggrieved with the order of the District Forum, the petitioner in RP No.122 of 2011, who was opposite party No.2 in the original complaint filed an appeal before the State Commission being FA No.1286 of 2004.  The State Commission vide its order dated 13.10.2010 passed the following order:-
“Keeping in view the discussion held above, we are satisfied that the appellant and respondent No.2 had committed medical negligence while operating the respondent on 12.6.2002 in the hospital of respondent No.2. Therefore, the compensation awarded by the learned District Forum in the impugned judgment dated 17.9.2004 is upheld.  However it is payable not by the appellant alone but jointly and severally by the appellant and respondent No.2.
52.  This appeal is, therefore, disposed of with costs of Rs.10,000/- with the only modification that respondent No.2 would also be liable with the appellant jointly and severally.  Out of the amount of costs, Rs.5,000/- will go to the New India Assurance Company Ltd. Respondent No.3 and Rs.5,000/- will be payable to respondent No.1.
53.  The costs of Rs.2,000/- awarded by the learned District Form are also upheld.  The impugned judgment dated 17.9.2004 is accordingly modified in the terms stated above.
54. The appellant had deposited an amount of Rs.25,000/- with this Commission at the time of filing of the appeal on 18.10.2004.  He had also deposited a sum of Rs.25,000/- with this Commission under the orders dated 25.1.2005.  The amount of Rs.50,000/- along with interest accrued thereon, if any, be remitted by the registry to Surjit Kumar respondent by way of a crossed cheque/demand draft after the expiry of 45 days, under intimation to the learned District Forum and to the appellant.
55.  Remaining amount, if any, shall be paid by the appellant to Surjit Kumar respondent.  Respondent No.2 shall also pay the amount of his share to Surjit Kumar respondent immediately.”
4.      Hence two revision petitions.
5.      These revision petitions were listed before the Circuit Bench at Chandigarh for the convenience of the parties on 20.1.2020.  The notice has been served to all the parties and all parties were aware about the listing of these revision petitions in Chandigarh.  Learned proxy counsel appeared on behalf of the main counsel for the petitioners and stated that the petitioners have already given the written submissions, which may be looked into for their arguments.  Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant was present and was heard.
6.      I have also seen the written arguments filed by the petitioner. It has been mentioned in RP No.122 of 2011 that the State Commission erred in observing that since petitioner operated the respondent no.1/complainant along with respondent no.2, therefore, medical negligence if proved would be on the part of the petitioner and respondent no.2.  It is submitted that merely on the fact that petitioner was associated with the respondent no.2 for performing the operation of the respondent no.1, it cannot be presumed that petitioner has also committed medical negligence while operating the respondent no.1/complainant.
7.      It has been mentioned that the State Commission failed to appreciate that respondent no.1/complainant withheld the best evidence which was available with him in the form of pre-operative x-ray and post operative x-ray from which it could have been clear that the operation was successful and both the ends of fracture were in position.  It is submitted that preoperative and post operative x-rays were given to the respondent no.1/complainant along with discharge certificate with the advice of follow-up treatment at the time of the discharge.  The State Commission failed to observe that said x-rays are in the possession of the respondent no.1/complainant and the same was withheld by him for the reasons best known to him.  Further it is submitted that this fact remained uncontroverted by the respondent no.1/complainant but District Forum and the State Commission wrongly held that the x-rays were retained by the petitioner.
8.      It is stated in the written arguments that the impugned order is liable to be set aside as State Commission wrongly held both the petitioner and the respondent no.2 for committing medical negligence.  It is submitted that petitioner performed the operation with utmost skill and due care as expected from an experienced medical practitioner.
9.      It is further mentioned that the State Commission as well as the District Forum erred in appreciating the report of the Board of Doctors and misinterpreted the same.  The said report merely observed that mal-alignment could be the cause of shortening of the leg of the respondent no.1/complainant, however, same cannot be interpreted that board of doctors unambiguously held that the shortening of the leg in the case in hand was certainly due to the mal-alignment of fracture fragments.  It was further submitted that there is nothing in the report dated 31.8.2004 which suggests that there was any medical negligence on the part of the petitioner.
10.    In revision petition No.354 of 2011, it has been mentioned that the State Commission failed to appreciate that it was categorically pleaded by the petitioner that the pre-operative and post-operative x-rays were given to the respondent no.1/the complainant along with discharge certificate with the advice of follow up.
11.    It was further stated that the State Commission failed to appreciate that even a bare perusal of the Board constituted by the District Forum, it is clear that there was no negligence on behalf of the petitioner inspite of that the State Commission has upheld the order of the District Forum with modifications making the petitioner liable jointly and severally.
12.    It was further argued that the State Commission failed to appreciate that it is settled law that no liability can be fastened in a case of medical negligence unless and until there is an expert evidence.  In the case in hand, there is no expert evidence against the petitioner wherein the petitioner has been shown to be negligent.  Therefore, unless and until there is any evidence on the record holding the petitioner as negligent, the complaint and impugned order deserves dismissal.
13.    Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that the District Forum had referred the matter for the expert opinion to the Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons and this Board gave its report on 31.8.2004.  Learned counsel stated that the Medical Board has confirmed the shortening of about 2 inches in the left leg.  The reason is given that the same may be due to mal-alignment of the fracture fragments.  Thus, it is clear that during operation fracture fragments were not rightly aligned.  Thus, this was a clear negligence on the part of the operating doctor.
14.    Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon was doctor in the Government Hospital, however, he performed operation in the private hospital namely, Amar hospital.  Thus, he was also guilty of violating the Government Rules.
15.    The pre and post operative x-ray were not provided by the Amar hospital owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon and therefore, the State Commission has treated the hospital also deficient in providing the service.  In fact, there is a clear finding of the State Commission that no proper record was supplied by the Amar hospital, which was a primary duty of the hospital to maintain the proper records of the patient treated in the hospital.  Even the bed ticket was not provided to the Medical Board.  Thus, the State Commission has rightly found joint liability on both the doctors, one being the operating doctor and the other being the owner of the Amar hospital.  The life of the complainant was totally compromised due to shortening of left leg by two inches and ultimately the complainant died and the present matter is being contested by the LRs.  Learned counsel further stated that the LRs. of the complainant are very poor and due to this fact they could not file any appeal for enhancement of the compensation.
16.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the complainant as well as the points raised in the revision petitions.  One of the main objections in the revision petitions is that there is no expert report to show that the operation was wrongly performed and the fracture fragments were mal-aligned in the operation.  Prima facie this objection is not sustainable as the report of Medical Board of Orthopaedic Surgeons is on record and it clearly states that there was mal-alignment in the fracture fragments.  Clearly, this has led to shortening of the left leg by two inches and the same has been confirmed by the Medical Board. As the Medical Board constituted of Orthopaedic Surgeons, no better opinion can be obtained than from this Board.  It is not only the shortening of the left leg, but the patient also suffered for about more than one year with severe pain.  Thus, clearly, medical negligence on the part of the operating Dr. Manmohan Singh Dhillon, is proved.
17.    Coming to the deficiency on the part of Amar Hospital, owned by Dr. K.N.S. Dhillon, it is clear that the record about the treatment and operation of the patient was not submitted before the Medical Board, even pre and post operation x-rays were not submitted before the Medical Board.  It has been alleged by the petitioner that the x-rays were given to the complainant along with discharge, however, the State Commission has given clear finding that there is no proof that these x-rays were handed over to the complainant. As the complainant suffered from pain and filed a consumer complaint, it is quite unlikely that he will not place these records before the Medical Board if he had the same.  Logically also, it is the discharge summary, which incorporates all the examinations and the treatment given but the test reports done by the hospital are generally kept with the hospital record.  Moreover, Hon’ble Supreme Court in Smt. Savita Garg Vs. The Director, National heart Institute, IV (2004) CPJ 40 (SC) held the following:-
“Once an allegation is made that the patient was admitted in a particular hospital and evidence is produced to satisfy that he died because of lack of proper care and negligence, then the burden lies on the hospital to justify that there was no negligence on the part of the treating doctor or hospital.  Therefore, in any case, the hospital is in a better position to disclose what care was taken or what medicine was administered to the patient.  It is the duty of the hospital to satisfy that there was no lack of care or diligence.  The hospitals are institutions, people expect better and efficient service, if the hospital fails to discharge their duties through their doctors, being employed on job basis or employed on contract basis, it is the hospital which has to justify and not impleading a particular doctor will not absolve the hospital of its responsibilities.”
18.    Thus, relying on the above observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court as well as the fact that the medical record including important pre and post operation ex-rays were not provided by the petitioner to the Medical Board, the deficiency on the part of the hospital and consequently on the petitioner is also proved.
","19.    Based on the above discussion, I find that the State Commission has rightly decided medical negligence against both the petitioners herein.  Accordingly, I do not find illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 13.10.2010 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Consequently, the Revision Petition Nos.122 & 354 of 2011 are dismissed.

","JUDGMENT
JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainants who are petitioners herein, entered into agreements with respondent no.7 (OP No.5 in the Consumer Complaint) namely Mr. John Baptist Roddrigues for purchase of residential flats paying a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- in RP/2050/2019, Rs.4,11,400/- in RP/2051/2019, Rs.8,15,000/- in RP/2052/2019, Rs.8,65,000/- in RP/2053/2019 & Rs.8,60,000/- in RP/2054/2019.   The possession, according to the complainants, was to be delivered within 15 months of the agreement.  The possession however, was not delivered.  The case of the petitioners is that OP No.1 to 4 are the owners of the land on which the flats were to be constructed and OP No.1, 2 & 4 in the Consumer Complaint had also executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of OP No.5 authorizing him to construct and sell the residential flats on their property.  The case of the complainants is that the aforesaid immovable property was transferred to OP No.7 and OP No.8 namely Madhusudan Acharya and Archana Acharya.  Since the possession of the flats was not delivered to them, they approached the concerned District Forum by way of Consumer Complaints impleading the land owners as well as the subsequent purchasers in addition to OP No.5 Mr. John Baptist Roddrigues as the OPs in the Consumer Complaint.  The prayer made in the complaint was for refund of the amount which the complainant had paid to OP No.5 alongwith interest and compensation.
","2.      OP No.7 & 8 in the Consumer Complaint, to whom the subject property is alleged to have been transferred, filed applications before the District Forum seeking dismissal of the Consumer Complaints against them.  The said applications having been dismissed, they approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Revision Petitions.  The Revision Petitions were allowed and the complaints were dismissed against OP No.7 & 8.  The complainants are pending against the other OPs.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the petitioners/complainants are before this Commission.
3.      It is an admitted position that there is no privity of contract between the complainants and OP No.7 & 8 in the Consumer Complaints.  It is also an admitted position that the agreements were executed only between the complainants and OP No.5 namely Mr. John Baptist Roddrigues.  It is also an admitted position that the payment was made by the complainants only to OP No.5 Mr. John Baptist Roddrigues.
4.      The prayer made in the Consumer Complaint is for refund of the amount which the complainants/petitioners had paid to OP No.5 Mr. John Baptist Roddrigues with interest and compensation.  The complainants have not claimed possession of the flats which OP No.5 had agreed to sell to them.  If the complainants succeed on merits, they will be entitled to refund and compensation only from OP No.5 and not from OP No.7 & 8.  Therefore, neither they are necessary nor are they proper parties to the Consumer Complaints which the petitioners had filed before the District Forum.  The view taken by the State Commission is absolutely in accordance with law and does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  The Revision Petitions are therefore, dismissed.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Devender Singh, Advocate 
","JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA, PRESIDING MEMBER
The present First Appeal has been filed against the order dated 21.05.2018 of the State Commission in complaint no. 386 of 2013 of respondent nos. 1 & 2.  Since, the Appeal has been filed with delay of 348 days,  an application being IA No. 9808 of 2019 has been filed for condonation of delay in filing the Appeal.  The arguments of learned counsel for the appellant have been heard on this application.  My order on the application is as under:
IA No. 9808 of 2019 ( condonation of delay
1.         It is argued by counsel for the appellant that delay had occurred since the appellant became aware of the order dated 21.05.2018 only in April 2019  accidentally when the counsel had gone to the State Commission for attending other matter of the appellant and chanced  upon to see the cause list and learnt that execution petitions were pending.  Thereafter, an application for certified copy was filed immediately and certified copy of  impugned order was received on 03.06.2019.  The appeal was drafted thereafter and was filed on 14.06.2019. It is submitted that delay had occurred due to these reasons and was not intentional.
2.         It is settled proposition of law that condonation of delay is not a matter of right.  The applicant is required to give sufficient causes while seeking condonation of delay.  Sufficient causes means that party had acted diligently and bonafidely but
-3-
where  party is said to have not acted diligently and remained inactive, it cannot be said that party had sufficient causes for condonation of delay.  It is also settled proposition of law that limitation may harshly effect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes.
3.         In the case of Ram Lal and Ors. Vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held that condonation of delay is a discretionary jurisdiction and has to be exercised in appropriate cases.  Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly  held that where the party has not acted diligently and bonafidely, such a discretion should not be exercised in its favour.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“12. It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
4.         In the case of R.B..Ramlingam  Vs. R.B.Bhavaneshwari I (2009) CLT 188 SC, Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held that it is the duty of the Court to examine whether the delay has been properly explained and the test to be applied is
-4-
that whether petitioner had acted with reasonable diligence.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
""5. We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
5.         In the present case, the ground given is ignorance of passing of the impugned order dated 21.05.2018 till April 2019 when the petitioner learnt that execution application is pending against him that too through his advocate who had gone to the State Commission to attend another matter and happened to check the cause list and learnt about it.  Under the Act, the Commissions are bound to serve a free copy of its order upon both the parties.  There is no contention in the application that no such free copy had been sent to the petitioner or if sent, had not been received by it.  The contention is that they learnt of the order in April 2019 and that the certified copy was supplied to them on 03.06.2019.  It is not disclosed as to on which date they applied for the certified copy.  All these facts show that delay has not been sufficiently explained.  Even if, I presume that appellant had learnt of the impugned order in April 2019, admittedly the appeal has not been filed within the period of limitation i.e. within 30 days from the date of such knowledge.
6.         In the case of Anshul Aggarwal Vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (2011) 14 SCC 578, Hon’ble Supreme Court  has held that  while dealing
-5-
with such application, special nature of Act should be kept in mind.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“5.            It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Fora.""
","7.         For the aforegoing reasons, I found no reason to condone the delay of 348 days.  Application for condonation of delay is, therefore, dismissed.
First Appeal
Consequently, thereupon, First Appeal is also dismissed being barred by limitation.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Surojit Banerjee, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :NEMO 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
Respondent 3 to 26, who are the owners of different plots amalgamated the said plots into a single plot of land and they entered into an agreement with the appellant for construction of a ground + five storied building on the aforesaid amalgamated plot of land.  The complainants entered into agreements with the appellant, for purchasing residential flats in the proposed building.  The possession, as per the agreement, executed by them with the appellant, was to be delivered by January 2013.  The possession however, was delivered to them late,  though it had been delivered before the Consumer Complaint came to be instituted by them.  The Sale Deeds in their favour were also executed.  The complainants then approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints, alleging therein that neither the Completion Certificate had been provided to them, nor had the petitioners completed the remaining works in the building constructed by it.  It was also alleged by them that the building material used by the appellant was inferior, as a result of which, the floors had cracked and the walls of the flats had got damaged.  The following were the prayers made in the Consumer Complaints instituted by them:
Direction may kindly be given upon the opposite party No.1 to complete the work of the common areas and facilities as mentioned in the Schedule “C” herein below and to repair and/or repairs the damages portion of the flat within a specific period;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to pay the interest at the rate of 18% as per agreement for sale and also on account of non-deliver the flat within the time as mentioned in the agreement for sale;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to demolish the illegal and unauthorized construction on the ground floor at their own cost and expenses failing which necessary order may kindly be passed to demolish the said illegal and unauthorized construction at the cost and expenses of the opposite party no.1;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to handover the completion certificate in respect of the Schedule “A” property;
Directing the opposite parties to form flat owners Association in respect of Schedule “A” property;
Directing the opposite party no.1 to install separate electric meter in the name of your petitioner;
Compensation to the tune of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakh) for mental agony and harassment;
Damages to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakh) only for below quality materials used in flat.
2.      The complaints were resisted by the appellant who denied the allegations made in the complaint against it and interalia stated that it had executed the Conveyance Deed in favour of the complainants and delivered possession of the allotted flats as well as the garage to them.  It was also claimed that the flat as well as all the common facilities, amenities etc. were completed at the time the possession was delivered.  It was also claimed in the written version that the lifts had also been installed and were running in good condition.
3.      The State Commission, vide impugned order dated 18.12.2017,  declined all the prayers made by the complainants except the prayer for issuance of a direction to the appellant to hand over the completion certificate to them.  The State Commission also directed the petitioners to pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation and Rs.10,000/- as the cost of litigation, within ten days failing which the said amount was to carry interest @ 8% per annum.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellants are before this Commission by way of these appeals.
5.      The complainants have not filed any cross-appeal challenging the order passed by the State Commission despite the fact that most of the prayers made by them in the Consumer Complaint were declined by the State Commission.  As a result, it is not permissible for this Commission to go into the correctness or otherwise of the said order to the extent the other prayers made by the complainants in the Consumer Complaints were declined.
6.      As noted earlier, the State Commission directed the petitioners to provide completion certificate to the complainants, in addition to awarding compensation to them.  The learned counsel for the appellants has drawn my attention to the Occupancy Certificate purporting to be issued by Dumdum Municipality and available on page no.132 of the paper-book, which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
Subject: Grant of Occupancy Certificate under sub-rule (2) of Rule
of 34.
Building Particulars :   Premises No. and Street 14, Masterda
Sarani, Kolkata-79.
Ward No. 06
Sir,
With reference to your notice of completion dated 14.07.2014 I hereby certify that the building as per description below on plot 14, Masterda Sarani, Kolkata-79 Ward No.06 in respect of which plans were sanctioned vide Building Permit No.PWD/Plan-G+V/424/2010-2011 dated 24.03.2011 has been inspected with reference to the provision of the Building Rules, under West Bengal Municipal Act, 1993 and is Certified to be fit for occupation.
DESCRIPTION OF CONSTRUCTION, USE AND CONDITIONS, IF ANY.
One set of building plans with endorsement “Approved Completion Plan” is returned herewith (where required).
7.      This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that no certificate other than the Occupancy Certificate extracted hereinabove is required under the rules of the Dumdum Municipality.  He has also drawn my attention to the proceedings recorded by the Assistant Director, Directorate of Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices, Govt. of West Bengal dated 23.07.2015, which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
Both the complainants and opposite party are present for the mediation meeting.  The opposite party have appointed Sri Arunachal Bhattacharjee, Advocate as their representative.
It has been mutually agreed that all the pending works as pointed out lay the complainants including electric connections from C.E.S.E. will be completed within four (04) months of time since today, i.e. 23/7/15.
The complainants may approach the legal forum after expiry of the above period.
It may be noted that the complainants have occupied their flat and got their possession later and the completion certificate from the municipality concerned has been obtained by the OP.
This is also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that the aforesaid proceedings are signed by all the complainants.
8.      It would thus be seen that an Occupancy Certificate had been obtained by the appellants and had been provided to the complainants by 23.07.2015 whereas the Consumer Complaints came to be instituted in the year 2016.  If the appellants were not required to obtain any certificate other than the Occupancy Certificate extracted hereinabove, the direction to the appellants to obtain the Completion Certificate and deliver the same to the complainants was not called for.  As far as the compensation and cost of litigation is concerned, it has come in the order of the State Commission that the possession of the allotted flat was to be delivered to the complainants by January 2013.  The possession however, came to be delivered much later.  It is not known when the Occupancy Certificates were made available by the appellants to the complainants though it appears from the proceedings recorded by the Assistant Director, Directorate of Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices that the same had been completed by 23.07.2015.  The notice of completion was given by the appellants to Dumdum Municipality only on 14.07.2014.  Therefore, there was a delay in obtaining the said Occupancy Certificate.
","9.      Considering the delay in obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and delivering possession of the allotted flats to the complainants, the direction for payment of compensation and the cost of litigation does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.  It is however, directed that in case the compensation and cost of litigation, as awarded by the State Commission, paid within six weeks from today, it shall not carry any interest.   The appeals stand disposed of.

","Revision Petition No.652 of 2013 has been filed by the petitioner Manager, New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and Revision Petition No.2291 of 2013 has been filed by Dr. Vipul Rai & others against the order dated 05.12.2012 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Haryana, (in short ‘the State Commission) passed in First Appeal No.955 of 2012 & First Appeal No.768 of 2012.
2.     Brief facts of the case are that Sh. Suresh Kumar Monga a cashier in Punjab National Bank, Sirsa suffering from piles (Haemorrhoids) visited Dr. Vipul Rai running clinic under name and style of Monika Hospital at Rania Gate, Sirsa. Dr. Vipul Rai assured Suresh Kumar Monga in the presence of Smt. Veena Rani that he was a competent doctor for this disease. Dr. Vipul Rai admitted Suresh Monga to his hospital for treatment of piles on 15.10.2006.  Dr. Vipul Rai tied a thread to haemorrhoids and performed surgery, made a cut with an instrument, and there was severe bleeding.  Smt. Veena Rani complainant not being aware of competency of doctor to treat her husband was entirely at the mercy and suggestion of respondent-doctor.  Smt. Veena Rani inquired about the condition of the patient and about severe bleeding from the respondent-doctor. Dr. Vipul Rai left the hospital on an excuse.  The doctor discharged Suresh Monga on a lame excuse on 22.10.2006.  Dr. Vipul Rail charged Rs.2,597/- on account of hospital charges (Rs.200/- operation theatre charges, Rs.400/- bed charges, Rs.497/- medicines charges and Rs.1,500/- surgery fee). Smt. Veena Rani came to know that Dr. Vipul Rai performed an operation and condition of her husband has deteriorated and her husband started vomiting and feeling difficulty in breathing.  Dr. Vipul Rai left the patient and the members of the family in a critical condition.  Suresh Monga was immediately shifted to Talwar Nursing Home, Sirsa with the help of a relative namely Pardeep Sachdeva. The doctor at Talwar Nursing Home, Sirsa found that the condition of the patient was critical due to operation by an unqualified doctor and referred the patient to tertiary care centre for ventilatory support and further management after about five hours at about 11.00 pm on 22.10.2006. Talwar Nursing Home,Sirsa charged Rs.3,000/-. Smt. Veena Rani took her husband to CMC Hisar and thereafter to Inderperstha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi.  Suresh Monga remained admitted in Inderperstha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi from 23.10.2006 till death at 09.50 am on 2.11.2006.  The cause of death was portal pyaemia with septicaemia with multiple organ failure.  The complainant spent an amount of Rs.5,50,000/- on the treatment of her husband.  Smt. Veena Rani alleged that Suresh Monga died due to negligence on the part of Dr. Vipul Rai who was not competent or qualified to perform surgery and to prescribe allopathic medicines and filed a consumer complaint for adequate compensation, costs of litigation etc.under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Dr. Vipul Rai, Monika Hospital, Sirsa appeared and filed written version in the case.  It was averred that the respondent-doctor is qualified B.A. M.S. and is registered under the Ayurvadic and Unani Medical Council (Haryana) under the Indian Medicine Central Council Act and a qualified and experienced, medical practitioner,  Suresh Kumar Monga was admitted to the clinic for piles in anus and was treated to the best of knowledge and skill from 15.10.2006 to 22.10.2006.  Suresh Kumar Monga was cured and was charged doctor fee and hospital charges.  The respondent-doctor maintains a standard hospital, with all required medicines and apparatus as per specifications.  Suresh Kumar Monga was in good condition during stay in the hospital.  It was denied that opposite party was responsible for the death of Suresh Kumar.  All the remaining allegations were specifically denied and it was prayed that the complaint be dismissed with costs.
3.      The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Sirsa, (in short ‘District Forum’) vide its order dated 18.05.2012 allowed the complaint as under:-
“20.         The complaint, therefore, succeeds and is partly allowed.  Both Dr. Vipul Rai and his indemnity insurer that is New India Assurance Company Limited, Sirsa, opposite parties are directed to make payment of compensation amount of Rs.6,22,000/- with interest on the award amount at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint that is 22.1.2007 till realization.  The complainants shall also be entitled to Rs.15,000/- for harassment, mental tension, agony etc. and Rs.3,000/- costs of proceedings.  We direct both the opposite parties to implement the present order within a period of two months failing which the complainants shall be entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum under Section 25 and/or 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Dr. Vipul Rai and his indemnity insurer New India Assurance Company Limited, Sirsa, both the parties shall be jointly and severally liable to implement the order.  We may hasten to add that the liability of the New India Assurance Company Limited, Sirsa, Insurance Company shall however is limited to the extent of Rs.3,00,000/- liability mentioned in the insurance policy (Ex.R2).”
4.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, both the opposite parties preferred appeals No.955 of 2012 and 768 of 2012 before the State Commission.  The opposite party No.1 Dr. Vipul Rai preferred appeal No.768 of 2012 and the Insurance Company preferred appeal No.955 of 2012 before the State Commission.  The State Commission vide its common order dated 05.12.2012 dismissed both the appeals.
5.      Hence the present revision petitions.
6.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  The parties will be referred to as mentioned in the order of the District Forum for the sake of convenience.  Learned counsel for the opposite party No.1, Dr. Vipul Rai stated that he performed the procedure as prescribed in the Ayurvedic literature.  He is a B.A.M.S. (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) doctor and he is authorised to do such procedure.  Learned counsel further stated that this procedure is prescribed in the B.A.M.S. course, therefore, it cannot be said that B.A.M.S. doctor is not authorised to do this procedure.  In respect of his contention learned counsel relied upon the copy of the prospectus that has been filed.  It is asserted that under the chapter of Charak Samhita, this procedure is laid down.  Learned counsel further relied upon the National Health Portal a copy of which has been filed.  It is stated by the learned counsel that the procedure in respect of Kshara Sutra Therapy (Medicated Caustic Thread) is mentioned in the National Health Portal, wherein it is clearly written that:-
“Kshara Sutra therapy is a minimal invasive Ayurvedic Parasurgical procedure and time-tested Ayurvedic technique in the management of Anorectal disorders.  It is a safe, sure and cost effective method of treatment for fistula-in-ano, haemorrhoids and other sinus diseases.”
7.      It was emphasised by the learned counsel for opposite party No.1 that the opposite party No.1 has done nothing unauthorisedly and he only followed the procedure given in the literature and he is authorised to do this procedure being a B.A.M.S. doctor.
8.      In support of his assertion, learned counsel referred to the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Subhasis Bakshi and others Vs. W.B.Medical Council and others, (2003) 9 SCC 269, wherein the following has been held:-
“11. In this context it is worthwhile to discuss Dr. Mukhtiar Chand v. State of Punjab, (1998) 7 SCC 579. In this case the validity of Notifications issued by the State Governments of Punjab and Rajasthan, under Rule 2(ee)(iii) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 whereby the Governments declaring some vaids/ hakims as persons practicing modern medicines were challenged. Upholding the validity of the Notifications and the said Rule, this Court held that, for the purpose of Drugs Act ""what is required is not the qualification in modern scientific system of medicine but a declaration by a State Government that a person is practicing modern scientific system and that he is registered in a Medical Register of the State"". In Dr. Mukhtiar Chand, this Court also clarifies that there could be two registers for medical practitioners i.e, Indian Medical Register and State Medical Register. As far as the State Medical Registers are concerned, the State Government concerned according to the rules will determine the required qualification. While recognizing the rights of vaids or hakims to prescribe allopathic medicines, this Court also took into account of the fact that qualified allopathic doctors were not available in rural areas and the persons like vaids / hakims are catering to the medical needs of residents in such areas. Hence the provision which allows them to practice modern medicine was found in the public interest.”
9.      Learned counsel for the opposite party No.1, Dr. Vipul Rai stated that the revisionist did not perform any surgery as understood in allopathy.  He performed the procedure of “Kshar Sutra”which is a well established and well accepted procedure in Ayurveda and by no stretch of imagination this can be termed as a crude method or surgery as understood in allopathy.  “kshar Sutra” is a Sanskrit phrase in which Kshar refers to anything that is corrosive or caustic; while sutra means a thread. Kshara sutra is an Ayurvedic medicated thread which is prepared by smearing a special Linen thread with Ayurvedic drugs.  It is prepared by applying the coatings of apamarg kshara, haridra churna etc. with snuhi ksheer as binding agent.  The thread is then sterilized by UV Radiation.  The cumulative effect of the above mentioned three drugs exerts a powerful debridement effect on the fistula tract & induces healing by the fresh & healthy granulation tissues.
10.   It has been alleged that the State Commission and also the DCDRF have ignored the fact that the Government vide Notification dated 22.01.2004 has further reiterated that “the institutionally qualified practitioners of  Ayurvedia, Siddha, Unani Tibb are eligible to practice respective systems with modern Scientific medicine including surgery and Gynecology Obstetrics, Anesthesiology, ENT, ophthalmology etc. based on the training and teaching.
11.    The learned counsel further stated that the State Commission and the District Forum have totally ignored the fact that the petitioner at no stage of the treatment of the patient violated any provision of law or any norms of his practice as a BAMS doctor and that he treated the patient with requisite skills, due care and as per standard Ayurvedic protocol and cannot be held liable for alleged medical negligence.
12.    Revisionist is a well-qualified B.A.M.S. (Ayurvedacharya) doctor, he is authorised to practice in Indian System of Medicines as well as in Modern medicines as per Notification of the Central Council of Indian Medicine dated 30.10.1996, which stipulates:-
“As per provision under section 2(1) of the Indian Medicine Central Council Act 1970 (48 of 1970) hereby Central Council of Indian Medicine notifies that, “Institutionally qualified practitioners of Indian Systems of Medicines (Ayurveda, Sidha and Unani) are eligible to practice Indian Systems of Medicine and Modern Medicine including Surgery, Gynaecology and Obstratics based on their training and teaching which are included in syllabi of via courses of ISM prescribed by Central Council of Indian Medicine after approval of the Government of India.  The meaning of the word “Modern Medicine” (Advances) means advances made in various branches of Modern Scientific Medicine, Clinical, Non-clinical, Bio-Sciences also Technological innovations made from time to time and notify that the courses and curriculum conducted and recognized by the Central Council of Indian Medicine are supplemented with such Modern Advances.  Further it is clarified that the rights of practitioners of Indian Systems of Medicines to practice Modern Scientific Systems of Medicine (Allopathic Medicine) are protected under section 17(3) of Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970.”
13.     Learned counsel for the opposite party No.2 Insurance Company stated that no expert report has been obtained by the State Commission in respect of procedure adopted by the doctor opposite party No.1.  Hence, no finding can be given on medical negligence by opposite party No.1.  If treatment given does not become effective, it cannot be said that there was negligence on the part of the doctor, therefore, if the doctor has done the prescribed procedure for the treatment of piles then no negligence can be attributed to the doctor. Learned counsel stated that the policy is for indemnifying the compensation required to be paid by opposite party No.1 doctor for medical negligence, however, if there is no medical negligence, the policy is not attracted.  Moreover, the opposite party No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of Clause 7 (1) (i) and 7(2) (ii) and conditions on which the policy was issued.  The clause 7 (1)(i) reads as under:-
“No liability shall attach to the company in respect of any criminal act or any act committed in violation of any law or ordinance.
The Clause 7(2)(ii) reads as under:-
“This policy does not cover liability arising out of deliberate, willful or intentional non compliance of any statutory provisions.
14.    This policy does not cover liability arising out of deliberate, willful or intentional non-compliance of any statutory provisions.  It was further argued by the learned counsel that the opposite party No.1 not only performed the crude method of piles operation, but also treated the complainant’s husband under allopathic system of medicines for which he was not authorized.  This is a clear violation of terms and conditions of the policy, however, the State Commission has not considered this aspect and has ordered the Insurance Company also to pay the insured amount along with the opposite party No.1.
15.    Learned counsel for the complainant stated that the husband of the complainant was totally all right and he was only suffering from the disease of piles.  He approached the opposite party No.1, doctor to get the treatment of piles, however, the husband of the complainant was not aware that opposite party No.1 was not a proper medical doctor.  The deceased was under the impression that the operation of piles would be done by opposite party no.1, however, opposite party No.1 performed such procedure. Again opposite party No.1 doctor performed another operation on 22.10.2006 when there was excessive bleeding and doctor left the hospital without taking any care of the patient and the patient was suddenly discharged.  The patient was then taken to another hospital where the patient remained only for five hours and then patient was shifted to Apollo Hospital, where he remained admitted for few days and ultimately he died of severe infection.  The cause of death as was given by the doctor in Apollo Hospital is portal pyaemia with septicaemia with multiple organ failure.  The problem started with wrong operation done by opposite party No.1. Dr. Vipul Rai, Monika Hospital, otherwise the husband of the complainant was not suffering from any other disease except for the piles.  The complainant had spent more than rupees five lacs in treatment of the husband of the complainant.  However, the same has not been allowed by the State Commission.  The State Commission has only allowed a compensation of Rs.6,22,000/- for the medical negligence on the part of the treating doctor . No appeal has been preferred by the complainant.  It was requested that the decision of the State Commission may be maintained in these revisions.
16.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record.  It has not been denied that the doctor is  B.A.M.S. doctor and therefore, he is authorised to practice modern system of Medicines as per Notification of the Central Council of Indian Medicine dated 30.10.1996.  As the name of the degree viz ‘Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery’, suggests that the surgery can be performed by a BAMS doctor.  The literature that has been provided by the opposite party No.1 from the website National Health Portal , though states that this is an Ayurvedic procedure, however, it also mentions the following:-
Application of Kshara Sutra in Fistula-in-ano-
“The patient is anaesthetized with local or spinal or general anesthesia, then a malleable probe is passed through the external opening of the fistula to the internal opening in the anal canal and probe is gently taken out through anal opening to outside along with a Kshara Sutra in the groove of the probe.  Later both ends of the Kshara Sutra is tied together.  The Kshara Surtra is replaced by a new one after an interval of one week. The Kshara Sutra gradually cuts and heals the tract. Finally the whole fistulous tract heals after cutting.”
","17.    From the above literature, it is clear that the procedure involves anaesthesia to be administered to the patient for performing this procedure.  Clearly only anaesthetist is authorised to give anaesthesia  to the patient before any operation and a general doctor or B.A.M.S doctor is not authorised to give any anaesthesia. If it is the stand of opposite party No.1 doctor that he has not used any anaesthesia then he has violated the procedure as given in the literature.    On the other hand if he has followed the procedure given in the literature submitted by him, then it implies that the doctor must have administered some anaesthesia to the patient whereas he was not authorised to administer the anaesthesia.  Thus, clearly procedure has been performed with negligence.  In these circumstances, I do not find any merit in revision petition No.2291 of 2013 filed by the opposite party no.1/Doctor Vipul Rai and the same is liable to be dismissed.
18.    Coming to the revision petition No.652 of 2013, it is seen that the doctor indemnification policy is from the opposite party No.2. The District Forum has awarded a compensation of Rs.6,22,000/- and out of which Rs.3,00,000/- is to be paid by the Insurance Company.  When the negligence has been proved on the part of the doctor, the doctor indemnification policy comes into play and the Insurance Company is liable to pay the compensation ordered consequent to the finding of medical negligence.   Clearly act of the opposite party No.1 Dr. Vipul Rai cannot be considered as a criminal act because there is no intent to harm the patient and there was also no mensria.  The act of the doctor is only of negligence in performing the operation, which has led to the death of the patient. Moreover, no law has been violated  as the doctor being a BAMS doctor is authorised to perform the operation as well as to use  modern scientific methods and medicines as per notification dated 30.10.1996.  Hence, the exclusions as per Clause 7 (1) (i) and 7(2) (ii) are not attracted in the present case.  Therefore, I do not find any merit in the revision petition No.652 of 2013 filed by the New India Assurance Company Ltd.
19.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 05.12.2012 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission and consequently, both the revision petitions being RP No.652 of 2013 and RP No.2291 of 2013 are dismissed.  The order of the District Forum be complied with within a period of 45 days from the date of this order.

  For the Respondent      :Appearance not marked 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER  (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent obtained an insurance policy bearing no.1001/0066099 from the appellant, for the period from 13.12.2006 to 12.04.2007.  The said policy insured the warehouse building of the complainant to the extent of Rs.50 lacs and the stock kept therein to the extent of Rs.1 Crore.  The case of the complainant/respondent is that due to hailstorm and heavy rains on 13.03.2007, the roof sheets of the warehouse building were extensively damaged and rain water which entered the warehouse, destroyed about 25% of the stock kept therein.  The complainant claims to have suffered loss to the extent of Rs.36,83,955/-, in respect of the stock alone.  This is also the case of the complainant that the damage to the building also caused them loss to the extent of Rs.6,41,268/- as was certified by one Sh. M.L. Gupta whom they had engaged for the purpose.  Since the claim was not paid, the complainant/respondent approached the concerned State Commission by way of a Consumer Complainant seeking principal amount of Rs.43,25,223/- alongwith interest and compensation.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the appellant which inter-alia stated in its reply that actual loss of the building was Rs.1,54,401/-.  As regards the damage to the stock, it was stated in the written version that the damaged stock did not belong to the complainant, the same being owned by third parties and the insurance policies did not cover the goods held in trust.
3.      The State Commission, vide impugned order dated 22.07.2011, directed the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.43,25,223/- to the complainant alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of institution of the complaint.  Being aggrieved, the respondent insurer is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
4.      As far as the damage to the building is concerned, M/s Cunningham Lindsey International Pvt. Ltd. who were the surveyors appointed by the insurer, assessed the gross damage to the complainant at Rs.2,12,533/-. After deduction on account of under insurance and policy excess, they arrived at a figure of Rs.1,44,401/-.  The survey report would show that the damage had happened to the asbestos sheets and the surveyor, on making enquiry from a dealer of Cement Asbestos Sheets, had verified the price of the new sheets.  He had counted the damaged sheets and calculated the cost of the new sheets, applying the price ascertained from the dealer, he made addition of labour charges for unloading the damaged sheets as well as for loading the fresh sheets.  Since the total value of the building, as per the Balance Sheet of the complainant, was Rs.68,82,483/-, under insurance was applied by him and after making further deduction, on account of policy excess, he arrived at an amount of Rs.1,44,401/-.
5.      As far as the alleged assessment made by Mr. M.L. Gupta is concerned, admittedly, he had been appointed by the complainant and therefore, was not a surveyor appointed in terms of Section 64UM of the Insurance Act.  In any case, his report has not been placed on record and therefore, it is not possible to find out on what basis, he had made the assessment.
6.      It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainant that the Panch witnesses had mentioned the loss to the roof of the warehouse at Rs.6,41,268/-.  The panchnama however, does not indicate on what basis the amount of Rs.6,41,268/- was worked out.  It does not give the total number of asbestos sheets, it does not give the market price of a new asbestos sheet and it also does not give the labour cost of removing the damaged sheets and installing new sheets.  Therefore, no reliance on the said Panch witnesses can be placed when we have available to us, a well-reasoned report by M/s Cunningham Lindsey International Pvt. Ltd., based upon the market price verified by them.
7.      As far as the stock of goods is concerned, it is an admitted position that the stock kept in the warehouse did not belong to the complainant and was third party stock belonging to agriculturists.  Insurance policy no. 1001/0066099 for the period from 13.12.2006 to 12.04.2007, had an exclusion Section which, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
(A) GENERAL EXCLUSIONS
(5) Loss, destruction or damage to bullion or unset precious stones, any curios or works of art for an amount exceeding Rs.10,000/-, goods held in trust or on commission, manuscripts, plans, drawings, securities, obligations or documents of any kind, stamps, coins or papers money, cheques, books of accounts or other business books, computer system records, explosives unless otherwise expressly stated in the policy.” (emphasis supplied)
It would thus be seen that though stock worth Rs.1 Crore was insured by the appellant, the said insurance coverage did not extend to the goods which were held in trust.  The stock which got damaged in the warehouse of the complainant, being third party stock and therefore, the goods held in trust, the said goods were not insured under the policy taken by the complainant.
8.      The learned counsel for the complainant submits that an additional premium of Rs.1,500/- was paid by the complainant to the appellant.  A perusal of Annexure-B to the policy would show that no premium was paid by the complainant for the goods held in trust.  Therefore, it cannot be said that an additional premium had been paid by the complainant for the goods held in trust.  The complainant paid premium only for insurance of the goods as well as premium for the building of the warehouse.  Since the goods held in trust were expressly excluded in terms of the exclusion clause contained in the insurance policy, it would be difficult to say that the said goods were also covered under the policy.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order is set aside and the appellant is directed to pay a sum of Rs.1,44,401/- to the complainant alongwith interest on that amount @ 9% per annum with effect from six months from the submission of the claim till the date of the actual payment.  The appeal stands disposed of.

1.    This Revision Petition has been filed under Section 21(b) of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 14.11.2013 of The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’, in F.A. No. 1658 of 2009 arising out of the Order dated 12.10.2009 in C.C. No. 138 of 2008 passed by The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Jalandhar, hereinafter referred to as the ‘District Forum’.
The Petitioners herein, The United India Insurance Company Limited, were the Opposite Parties before the District Forum, and are hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Insurance Co.’.
The Respondent herein, Mr. Kulwinder Singh Kang, was the Complainant before the District Forum, and is hereinafter being referred to as the ‘Complainant’.
2.    Heard learned Counsel for the Insurance Co. and the Complainant, and perused the material on record including inter alia the Order dated 12.10.2009 of the District Forum, the impugned Order dated 14.11.2013 of the State Commission and the Memorandum of Petition.
3.    In the interest of justice, to settle the matter on merit, the self-admitted delay of 28 days in filing the Revision Petition is condoned.
4.    The facts, relevant for the disposal of this Petition, shorn of unnecessary detail, are that the insured vehicle met with an accident on 21.01.2001. On his claim not being settled, the Complainant went before the District Forum on 21.11.2001. The District Forum directed the Complainant to furnish requisite documents as required by the Insurance Co., and concomitantly directed the Insurance Co. to decide the claim. Thereafter, on his claim (yet) not being settled, the Complainant again went before the District Forum on 13.03.2008.
The District Forum, vide its Order dated 12.10.2009, directed the Insurance Co. to pay to the Complainant Rs. 1,22,321.49p., the “Net Assessed Loss” (Rs.1,27,321.49p.) sans the “Salvage Value” (Rs. 5,000/-), as contained in the Surveyor’s report, and also directed that the salvage of the insured vehicle be delivered by the Complainant to the Insurance Co.
In appeal, the State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 14.11.2013, after appraising the evidence, and after critiquing the Surveyor’s report, directed the Insurance Co. to pay Rs.4,08,010/- to the Complainant with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the filing of the Complaint along with cost of litigation of Rs.10,000/-.
The Insurance Co., in its Memorandum of Petition, has limited its revision to challenge on the State Commission’s Order, its prayer is to set aside the said Order.
That is to say, the case, brought before this Commission by the Insurance Co., in essence relates to the quantum of compensation to be paid to the Complainant. No other issue agitated by the Insurance Co. before the District Forum has been specifically raised in its Memorandum of Petition.
5.    As such, the limited question before this Commission is whether the State Commission’s Order should sustain or it should be set aside. In the former contingency the Award made by the State Commission would obtain, in the latter contingency the Award made by the District Forum would obtain.
6.    It is seen that the District Forum went by the “Net Assessed Loss”, Rs.1,27,321.49p., minus the “Salvage Value”, Rs. 5,000/-,  and directed the Insurance Co. to pay Rs. 1,22,321.49p. to the Complainant. It also directed that the salvage be made over by the Complainant to the Insurance Co. (refer para 8 of its Order, apropos the quantum of compensation).
7.    The State Commission, on re-appreciation of the evidence, and after examining the Surveyor’s report, enhanced the compensation to Rs. 4,08,010/- and added interest (@ 9% p.a.) and cost of litigation (Rs. 10,000/-) (refer paras 9 to 12 of its Order, apropos the quantum of compensation).
8.    It may first be said that Investigation and Survey are fundamental in determining the amount to be paid to the insured.
A Survey cannot be disregarded or dismissed without cogent reasons.
However, having said that, it also goes concurrently that the rationale recorded in the Survey for making deductions etc. and arriving at the Net Assessed Loss should be convincing and pass credence in scrutiny.
9.    It is well evinced from its Order of 14.11.2013 that the State Commission has tested the Surveyor’s report and has well brought out that the Surveyor has not given sound and cogent reasons for disallowing certain items in the claim.
In its scrutiny, the State Commission has recorded reasons where, in its opinion, the Surveyor has erred.
The State Commission, in para 10 of its Order, has made mention of the Judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in “New India Assurance Co. Ltd. versus Pradeep Kumar”, IV (2009) CPJ 46 (SC) that “surveyor report is not the last and final word. It may be basis for settlement of claim but neither binding upon the insurer nor insured. - - -”.
It has rightly observed, in the 1st para 11 of its Order, that “- - - no specific reasons have been given by the Surveyor why he has disallowed the various items in his report. - - -.”
The State Commission has made a fair appraisal, it has disallowed items not covered under the policy, and given reasons where it has disagreed with the deductions made by the Surveyor in respect of items covered under the Policy.
10.  The Insured Declared Value (IDV) of the vehicle was Rs.4,70,000/-, an assessment made by a garage  calculated the loss at Rs.4,67,400/-, the State Commission scrutinized the Surveyor’s report and indicated with reasons where and why it disagreed with the deductions made by the Surveyor.
11.  The accident occurred in 2001, the Complaint was filed (for the second time) before the District Forum in 2008, the litigation before the District Forum and the State Commission extended upto 2013.
As such, the State Commission awarded reasonable interest of 9% per annum from the date of institution of the (second) Complaint i.e. 13.02.2008, which appears just and equitable. The cost of litigation of Rs. 10,000/-, also, on the face of it itself, appears reasonable.
12.  The District Forum erred in mechanically taking the Surveyor’s report at face value, without applying itself to whether sound and cogent reasons for deductions made therein were forthcoming.
The State Commission has rightly observed, in the 2nd para 11 of its Order, that “the learned District Forum has directly accepted the claim given by the Surveyor of the Company without recording any reason with regard to the admissibility of the claim given by the Surveyor of the Company, therefore, the learned District Forum has not properly appreciated the report of the Surveyor.”
The District Forum’s Order also suffers from internal inconsistency and incongruity. It awarded “Net Assessed Loss”, Rs.1,27,321.49p., minus the “Salvage Value”, Rs. 5,000/-, that is, Rs. 1,22,321.49p., to the Complainant, and then, after having adjusted the “Salvage Value” as afore, went on to direct the Complainant to make over the salvage to the Insurance Co.
13.  On the other hand, the State Commission made a balanced appreciation of the facts and evidence, and passed a well-appraised Order, with reasons recorded for disagreeing with the Surveyor’s assessment.
No palpable or crucial mis-appreciation of evidence, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible in the State Commission’s Order. As such, its Order calls for no interference.
","14.  The Revision Petition is dismissed, the State Commission’s Order of 14.11.2013 is upheld, the Award made therein is confirmed.
15.  The District Forum shall undertake execution of the Award made by the State Commission, as per the law.
16.  Let a copy each of this Order be sent by the Registry to the District Forum and to both sides within three days of its pronouncement.

The complainant / petitioner and his wife purchased a package tour known as ‘Winter Group Holidays Super Saver Andaman with Air Package’ from the respondent Cox & Kings Limited.  The flight of the complainants was to depart from New Delhi to Port Blair on 21.1.2015 and he and his wife were to return from Port Blair to New Delhi on 26.01.2015.  A sum of Rs.81,233/- was charged from them, by the respondent, for the Package.  The complainant and his wife left Bhilwara for New Delhi on 19.1.2015 and reached New Delhi on 20.01.2015.  In the night of 20.01.2015, they were informed by the carrier namely Jet Airways that their flight had been rescheduled.  They contacted the respondent Cox & Kings but no help was provided to them.  The complainant and his wife had to stay in a Hotel in the night; extension of the tour period was also refused by the respondent.
2.      The complainant and his wife reached airport at New Delhi on 21.01.2015 and at the check-in time they were informed that their ticket was not confirmed from Kolkata to Port Blair though they had confirmed tickets from New Delhi to Kolkata.  Again no help to the complainant and his wife was provided by the respondent.  The complainant and his wife therefore had to return back to the hotel so that they could take a direct flight on 22.01.2015 to Port Blair.  When the complainant and his wife reached the Airport at 3 pm on 22.01.2015, again they were informed that they had confirmed ticket only upto Kolkata and that their tickets from Kolkata to Port Blair were not confirmed.  They called up the respondent Cox & Kings, who were requested to either provide the confirmed tickets or to refund the amount, which the respondent had charged from them.  However, this was denied to the complainants, who had to cancel the trip and return to Bhilwara, without undertaking the trip to Port Blair.  The complainant thereafter, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint, impleading Cox & Kings as well as its insurer United Insurance Co. Ltd. as the opposite parties in the consumer complaint.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the respondent Cox & Kings Ltd., which inter-alia stated in its written version that there was no defect or deficiency on their part in rendering services to the complainant and his wife. They however, admitted having sold the package to the complainants for a consideration of Rs.81,232/-.
4.      The District Forum allowed the consumer complaint and directed the respondents to pay a sum of Rs.81,232/-, which the complainants had paid for the package, along with compensation, cost of litigation, hotel expenses etc. making a total sum of Rs.1,98,232/-.
","5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the respondents approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.  Vide impugned order dated 10.10.2019, the State Commission allowed the appeals and consequently dismissed the consumer complaint.  Being aggrieved, the petitioner / complainant is before this Commission.
6.      It is evident from the facts noted hereinabove that the entire grievance of the complainants is on account of cancellation of the flight.  Though, tickets for the said flight were sold to them by the respondent Cox & Kings Ltd., they were not in any manner responsible for the cancellation of the flight by the carrier namely Jet Airways.  While selling tickets to the complainant and his wife, respondent Cox & Kings Ltd., was acting only as an agent of the Jet Airways and being agent of a disclosed principal, and there being no impediment at that time in filing a complaint against the carrier, they were not liable for the acts and omissions on the part of the said disclosed principal.  A reference in this regard can be made to the provisions of Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act.  It would also be pertinent to note here that it was not at all difficult for the complainants to file a consumer complaint against the Jet Airways at the time they chose to file the said complaint only against the Cox & Kings and United Insurance Co. Ltd.
7.      As far as United Insurance Co. Ltd. is concerned, there is no privity of contract between the said company and the complainants, no policy having been issued by the said company to the complainants.
8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the view taken by the State Commission does not call fall any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  The revision petition is therefore, dismissed.
9.      It is however, made clear that dismissal of the complaint shall not come in the way of the complainants filing a fresh complaint or availing any other remedy against the carrier Jet Airways Ltd.  If the complainant files a consumer complaint against the Jet Airways, he shall also be entitled to seek condonation of delay in filing the consumer complaint, in terms of the proviso to Section 24A of the Consumer Protection Act.
The revision petition stands dismissed.

For Parag Mobile        :    Mr. Zahid Ali, Advocate 
","These revision petitions have been filed by the petitioner Sona Gupta against the order dated 07.04.2017 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Uttar Pradesh (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Appeal No.2697 of 2013 & 2415 of 2013.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner/complainant purchased a mobile Samsung Star Nxt for about Rs.7,000/- from the Parag Mobile (dealer) opposite party No.1 in the original complaint case.  It is the case of the petitioner/complainant that this phone was advance phone where call can be recorded.  The cover of the packing of this phone also mentions the “Leading the Touch Revolution Call Record Yahoo Messenger”.  However, the petitioner/complainant observed that the phone had only a voice recorder and not the call recorder, therefore, the complaint was filed before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Mainpuri, (in short ‘the District Forum’) bearing CC No.62 of 2013.  The opposite parties resisted the complaint by filing the written statement.  The District Forum decided the complaint vide its order dated 30.09.2013 as under:-
“18.   The complaint of the complainant against the O.Ps. for recovery of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three lacs) from the O.Ps. is allowed.  O.P.No.1 shall pay Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lac) to the complainant and O.Ps. No.2 and 3 shall pay Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs).  All the three O.Ps. shall also pay Rs.5,000/- as costs.  On this amount, 7 percent per annum interest shall also be payable from the date of filing of the complaint i.e. 22.5.2013 till actual payment.
19.    Accordingly, the O.Ps. are ordered to pay the ordered amount to the complainant within one month from the judgment.”
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the opposite party No.1 preferred appeal No.2415 of 2013 before the State Commission.  Similarly, Samsung India Electronics Pvt. Ltd. preferred appeal No.2697 of 2013 before the State Commission.  The State Commission vide its order dated 07.04.2017 decided both the appeals as under:-
“Both the appeals No.2697 of 2013 and Appeal No.2415 of 2013 are hereby allowed.  The judgment and order dated 30.09.2013, passed in complaint No.62 of 2013 is set aside and the complaint is hereby dismissed.
Copy of this judgment be placed on Appeal No.2415 of 2013.
Both the parties shall bear the costs of appeal.”
4.      Hence the present revision petitions.
5.      Heard AR of the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondents in both the cases.
6.      AR of the petitioner stated that there is no call recording facility in the mobile phone whereas the box in which the mobile phone was packed clearly mentions “Leading the Touch Revolution Call Record Yahoo Messenger”.  AR of the petitioner stated that call recording means that it should record not only the voice incoming or out going in a call but should also record the date, time and the name of the person, who is talking to the mobile holder.  AR of the petitioner stated that this mobile only has the voice recorder and cannot record the call incoming or outgoing.  It was ordered by this Commission that the Engineer of the Samsung India Ltd. should be present to demonstrate what is meant by call recording in this phone.  The Engineer demonstrated that the call can be recorded. However, the AR of the petitioner then stated that even if the call is recorded it does not give the time and date or the name of the person and therefore, the same cannot be used for any evidence.  During the demonstration, AR of the petitioner stated that the call can be recorded, but the date, time and name is not being recorded, that is why the mobile does not have actual facility of call recording.  No further demonstration in this regard was made by the opposite party Company.
7.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/opposite party stated that the State Commission has considered the issue involved in the present case and has reached to the conclusion that there is no deficiency on the part of the opposite party.  As no expert report was filed either by the complainant or same was obtained by the District Forum, without any expert report, it cannot be observed by the District Forum that there is no call recording in the mobile phone.  Earlier the complainant was saying that the mobile has only a voice recorder and not the call recorder. When the Engineer has given demonstration, the complainant has agreed that this mobile phone can record the calls.  No details of call recording are given on the box of the mobile phone.  The details of the mobile phone printed on the piece of paper inside the box reads as under:-
“Call Recording  Record conversation while speaking and use them for right evidence.”
8.      From the above, it is clear that the mobile phone records conversations and the same is agreed to by the AR of the petitioner.  There was a warranty period for the mobile phone and if the complainant was not satisfied with the functioning of the phone the complainant should have approached the dealer or the service centre of the manufacturer for removing these defects. When the mobile phone was purchased, the complainant should have checked all the functions of the mobile phone and then only after full satisfaction, the mobile should have been purchased.  The Engineer of the Samsung India Ltd. has already demonstrated that call can be recorded in this phone.  Thus, there is no error in the order of the State Commission and the same should be upheld.
","9.      I have carefully considered the arguments of both the sides and examined the material on record.  The State Commission has allowed the appeals of the opposite parties mainly on the ground that there was no expert report before the District Forum and still the District Forum allowed the complaint.  The stand of the complainant earlier was that a call cannot be recorded in this mobile phone, however, when the same was demonstrated by the Engineer of Samsung India Ltd., AR of the petitioner agreed that call can be recorded, but the date, time and name of the caller cannot be recorded.  It is seen that in para 5  of the complaint, it is stated by the complainant that actual call recording means not only the voice recording but date, time of the call and name of the caller also.  The opposite party No.1/dealer in its written statement has only replied that contents of para 5-6 are denied.  Nothing is mentioned about the call recording facility.  The Engineer of Samsung India Ltd. also did not demonstrate whether mobile was recording the name of the caller and date and time of the call.  It is true that the pamphlet of the phone mentions under the heading of “Call Recording” that it records conversations, which can be used for evidence.  It is clear that the same can be used only for evidence if the date, time and name of the caller is also recorded. All the smart mobile phones generally record the date, time and name of the caller. In fact, no evidence has been filed by the complainant to prove his case, and similarly even the opposite party has not filed any evidence to disprove the allegation of the complainant about non-recording of date, time and name of the caller while recording call.  Without any evidence, no view can be expressed whether the mobile phone actually records the date, time and name of the caller when a call is recorded.  It was the duty of the Engineer of the opposite party No.2 Company to have demonstrated the recording of date, time and name of the caller while recording the call. Though the claim of unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party is not proved, however, if a facility could not be demonstrated before this Commission and the complainant is not satisfied with the phone, the only remedy is that the phone is returned to the opposite parties and the opposite parties pay the cost of the phone along with some compensation. In my view, the ends of justice will meet, if the opposite party No.2 take back the phone and pay Rs.10,000/- to the complainant.  The opposite party No.2 in the original complaint i.e. the manufacturer shall pay Rs.10,000/- (rupees ten thousand only) to the complainant and will get the mobile collected from the complainant.  The period for compliance is four weeks from the date of receipt of this order.  The Revision Petition Nos.1171 of 2017 and 992 of 2018 are disposed of in terms of this order.

It has now been found that the amount was lying with respondent nos.2 and 3, i.e., Haryana Housing Board. It is further stated that the Estate Manager of Haryana Housing Board, Rewari is present to verify the same.
2.     Learned counsel for respondent nos.2 and 3 states that the amount deposited by respondent no.1/ complainant through Central Bank of India is lying with respondent no.2 & 3 and the respondent nos.2 and 3 are ready to hand over the cheque of refund of the amount along with interest @ 5.5% per annum which is mentioned in the booklet.
3.     As the amount was lying with respondent nos.2 and 3, the deficiency on the part of respondent nos.2 and 3 is self evident. Even the interest awarded by the State Commission @ 8.5% per annum seems reasonable. Accordingly, the revision petition no.2744 of 2016 is allowed and order of State Commission dated 17.05.2016 is modified to the extent that instead of the petitioner, Central Bank of India, the Haryana Housing Board will pay Rs.1,57,000/- along with interest @ 8.5% per annum to the complainant.
4.     In the interest of justice and to put an end to the litigation, it is ordered that the order of the State Commission be complied by respondent nos.2 and 3.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.      On 15.08.2006 Jarnail Singh (hereinafter referred to as the ‘patient’) suffered severe pain in upper abdomen and back with sweating and weakness. The local practitioner in the village gave pain killer injections, but no relief.  In the afternoon on the same day he got admitted in Shergill Multi Speciality Hospital (for short ‘Shergill Hospital’, OP-1).  Dr. Shergill (OP- 2) examined the patient and started treatment but pain did not subside. On 18.08.2006 Dr. Shergill performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gall bladder) under spinal anaesthesia. It was alleged that the OP-2 was negligent at every step of treatment i.e. making diagnosis, during operation and the post-operative care. He did not follow standards of practice and did not possess reasonable degree of skill. The patient was discharged prematurely from the OP-1 hospital. It was alleged that the patient was actually suffering from acute pancreatitis, but OP-2 wrongly diagnosed it as acute cholecystitis with cholelithisis (gall stone). To pin point the diagnosis, OP-2 did not do any confirmatory tests, radiological study and scanning from the experts. Most of the laboratory investigations were done from his own hospital laboratory. Though, Dr. Shergill was not a qualified radiologist, he performed the Ultrasonography (USG) of the patient on 16.08.2006 and opined about presence of stones in the gall bladder, but he failed to diagnose acute pancreatitis. The surgery could be avoided and only medical treatment would have helped the patient. During the hospital stay Serum Amylase test of the patient was not done. The reports were not shown to the patient or to the attendants. The histopathology report showed no evidence of gall stones, therefore it was not a case of acute cholecystitis. Thus, Dr. Shergill failed to diagnose acute pancreatitis and made false USG report. The OP-2 conducted the surgery hastily without considering that the patient’s diabetic status, the patient’s blood sugar level was 360.4mg% on 18.08.2006. After the surgery, the drain tube was kept in the abdomen for six days and blood stained fluid was coming from the tube which was an indication of acute pancreatitis.  It was alleged that the laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done under spinal anaesthesia, but it was mentioned in record as done under general anaesthesia.  The patient was discharged on 22.08.2006 though pain remained continued. Patient lost his appetite; he was unable to take solid food but was only taking liquid and semi-liquid diet. On 25.08.2006, the patient approached the OP-1 hospital for removal of stitches. On 27.08.2006 for symptoms of the pain in abdomen the OP-2 referred the patient for abdominal CT scan at Nijjar Centre and it was reported as ‘acute pancreatitis with early septic changes’. The complainant further alleged that due to inadequate medical/paramedical or nursing staff, in the Shergill Hospital, the patient was taken to Fortis Hospital, Amritsar on 27.08.2006 and admitted under the treatment of Dr. Amitabh Jairat (OP- 4) till 06.09.2006. Another USG study and 2nd CT Scan was performed at Nijjar Centre on 02.09.2006 and 05.09.2006 respectively which confirmed it as ‘pancreatic abscess’.  On 06.09.2006  for the treatment of pancreatic abscess the patient was discharged and referred to Satguru Pratap Singh Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana (in short Apollo Hospital). There he was operated by Dr. Arindam Ghosh (O.P. No. 5) for removal of pancreatic abscess on 07.09.2006.  Further, the patient underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy on 13.09.2006, but the patient could not recover, he died on14.09.2004 in Apollo Hospital.
2.      The complainant further alleged that the patient was insured with Medsafe Healthcare Ltd. and covered under Sanjivani Scheme for members of Cooperative Society but Dr. Shergill wrote to the insurance co. that the patient was alcoholic; therefore, the cashless facility from the insurance co. was rejected.
3.      Being aggrieved by the misdiagnosis and the wrong treatment given by OP-2 causing death of the patient, a   complaint was filed by Harinder Kaur, wife of patient seeking compensation of Rs. 99,91,737/- before the State Commission.
4.      The OPs - 1 & 2 have filed their written versions and submitted that the complaint was totally vexatious and misconceived; it   deserves to be dismissed with heavy cost. The OPs denied that at initial stage, the patient showed any symptoms of acute pancreatitis. The patient was presented with right sided upper abdominal pain without radiation. There was no sweating, no fever, no cyanosis or state of shock. The patient’s vital signs were normal, he was passing urine normally. The patient was also examined by Dr. O.P. Sharma (a retired Professor and Head of Medicine). On 17.08.2006 the serum amylase value was at normal level.  There were no signs of increase in white cell count (leucocytosis) or increase in serum amylase and serum lipase levels, therefore acute pancreatitis was ruled out.   The x-ray abdomen did not show air under diaphragm, which ruled out the possibility of perforated peptic ulcer. The normal ECG and ECHO also ruled out myocardial infarction (MI). The biochemical tests (LFT) also ruled out hepatitis. Therefore, OP-2 diagnosed the patient as case of acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. According to OP-2 the USG is often not helpful in diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.  The USG study is  90% specific for diagnosis of gall stone  whereas only  40 to 60% specific for acute pancreatitis which could be missed by trained radiologist also. The OP-2 further submitted that after the operation, the gall stones and gall bladder were put into the container and handed over to the relatives of the patient to get done  the histopathology examination (HPE). It was reported as chronic cholecystitis. The patient was discharged in good condition five days after the operation. The patient was brought to the hospital on 25.08.2006 for removal of stitches and he complained of pain in umbilical region. The provisional diagnosis of acute pancreatic was made, and patient was sent to Advance Diagnostic for  USG and serum amylase test. The USG was suggestive of acute pancreatitis, but the serum amylase level was normal.
5.      The State Commission on hearing both the sides and based on the evidence, partly allowed the complaint against  OP-1 & 2  and awarded Rs.5 lakh as compensation.
6.      Being aggrieved, parties on both the sides filed two separate appeals before this Commission. The first appeal no. 297 of 2011 has been filed by the complainants for enhancement of compensation and  the first appeal no. 465/2011 has been filed by the OPs for dismissal of the complaint.
7.      We have heard the learned counsel for both sides and perused the entire material on record.  Learned counsel on both the sides have reiterated and made their submissions as stated in their respective affidavits of evidence. The learned counsel for the complainants argued that as a result of misdiagnosis and performed wrong operation by OP-2 on 18-8-2006, the patient suffered acute pancreatitis and further  complication as Pancreatic Abscess. Therefore, the patient underwent operations on 7-9-2006 and 13-9-2006 at   Apollo Hospital.   The learned counsel for OPs vehemently argued and denied the negligence of OPs. The counsel for OPs reiterated the affidavits of evidence filed by the respective OPs.
8.      The crux of this case is whether negligently OP-2 diagnosed the case as acute cholecystitis with cholelithiasis instead of acute pancreatitis, wherein surgery could have been avoided.
9.      We have carefully perused the entire medical record. The history recorded by OP-2 on 15.08.2006 that;
“Acute pain upper right abdomen- 1 day
xxxx….
No h/o vomiting, hematemesis, malena or jaundice.
Pt gives h/o taking alcohol for many years.”
Provisional diagnosis: 1. Ac.Cholecystitis with cholelithiasis
2. Ac. Pacreatitis
3. Ac. MI
4. Hepatitis
We note depending on the symptoms, on 16-8-2006 abdominal USG, X-ray chest, ECG and blood tests were advised.
On 17.08.2006 :
The vitals Normal, Patient shown some improvement.
Called Dr.O.P.Sharma for medical assessment and opinion.
Advised Blood LDH, PTI and Sr. Amylase.
Pre-anaesthetic check-up call given to Dr. Mona Bansal.
On 18.08.2006 patient was operated. We find the proper informed consent is on record.
Post-operative period was uneventful; no signs of biliary leak and patient was discharged on 22.08.2006, and called on 25.08.2006 for removal of stitches.
10.    Thus, it is clear that based on the patient’s symptoms of pain in abdomen OP-2 himself performed the USG and reported as presence of gall stones in gall bladder. The complainant alleged that USG study requires a skilled operator and OP-2 does not possess any qualification in Radio-Diagnosis (M. D. – Radiology) as he was M. S. in general surgery. In our view in a routine practice, an experienced surgeon or a gynaecologist  can do the USG., however the treating doctor arrive to the diagnosis  on the  basis of  clinical examination, signs and symptoms of the patient. Thus, in our view, OP-2 has not committed any breach of duty of care or deviation from the standard of  practice. It is pertinent to note that sometime the experienced radiologist also fail to detect gall stones during USG study, because few artefacts mimic gallstones. It may amount to the error of judgment, but not negligence under such circumstances. The histopathology diagnosis confirmed it as chronic cholecystitis.
11.    The treating doctor shall choose the mode of treatment depending on his clinical diagnosis. On 15.08.2006, the patient had abdominal pain but there were no signs or symptoms of acute pancreatitis; therefore serum amylase estimation was not warranted at that time. We note the serum amylase done on 25.08.2006 and 26.08.2006 was 18 u/L and 21 u/L. Both values were normal and not suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The CT scan dated 27.08.2006 showed pancreatitis with early septic changes, but there was no biliary leak, injury or perforation which may cause septic changes. The serum amylase (38 u/L) and lipase (134 u/L) were normal. Therefore, we do not agree with the contention of complainant that the OP-2  failed to do the serum amylase test during the hospitalisation, and failed to make an early diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
12.    As per the medical literature, the pancreatic abscess is sequelae of acute pancreatitis. It is evident from the reports from Advanced Diagnostics, the Nijjar Lab, the Fortis Hospital, and Apollo Hospital that the findings were  suggestive of  Acute Pancreatitis which  subsequently developed pancreatic abscess. In the instant case, on 02.09.2006 i.e.  two weeks after the Cholecystectomy the patient showed radiological signs of acute pancreatitis. Thus, it was a mere presumption and misbelief of the complainant that it was the case of acute pancreatitis which OP-2 failed to diagnose at the initial stage on 18.08.2006. Thus, we do not agree that the cholecystectomy was unnecessarily performed by OP-2. Though the histopathology report did not mention about gall stones, but it was the case of chronic cholecystitis which was properly treated by Cholecystectomy. It is evident from the medical record   that   OP-2 performed cholecystectomy after excluding other possibilities of abdominal pain including acute pancreatitis with due investigations. In our considered view, there was no deficiency or breach in the duty of care from OP-2, who treated the patient reasonably as per the standard of practice. Our this view dovetails from the decisions of Hon’ble Supreme Court while dealing with medical negligence in the Jacob Mathew’s case (2005) SCC (Crl.) 1369 enunciated that,
25.  xxx…..
Court further observed that,
“When  a  patient  dies  or  suffers  some  mishap,  there  is  a  tendency  to  blame  the  doctor  for  this.   Things have gone wrong and, therefore, somebody must be punished for it. However, it is well known that even the best professionals, what to say of the average professional, sometimes have failures. A lawyer cannot win every  case  in  his  professional  career but surely  he  cannot be  penalized for  losing  a  case  provided  he appeared in it and made his submissions.”
In another case of Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa and others versus State of Maharashtra and others (1996) 2 SCC 634,   has observed as follows:
“The skill of medical practitioners differs from doctor to doctor. The very nature of the profession is such that there may be more than one course of treatment which may be advisable for treating a patient. Courts would indeed be slow in attributing negligence on the part of a doctor if he has performed his duties to the best of his ability and with due care and caution. Medical opinion may differ with regard to the course of action to be taken by a doctor treating a patient, but as long as a doctor acts in a manner which is acceptable to the medical profession, and the Court finds that he has attended on the patient with due care skill and diligence and if the patient still does not survive or suffers a permanent ailment, it would be difficult to hold the doctor to be guilty of negligence.”
13.    We further have gone through the standard books on Surgery [Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery, 24th ed, Maingot’s Abdominal Operations]12th ed]  and  Surgical Gastroenterology [Blumgart’s Surgery of the Liver, Pancreas and Biliary Tract, 5th ed].
Chronic cholecystitis is a state of prolonged gallbladder inflammation typically caused by recurrent episodes of cystic duct obstruction by gallstones. It may resolve spontaneously or progress to cause complications including biliary colic, cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. The presenting symptoms of acute pancreatitis are typically abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes, which are evident in blood and urine testing because of an inflammatory process in the pancreas. These clinical manifestations may present with an “acute abdomen"" and shock. About half of patients experience radiation to the back, nausea and vomiting occur in 85% of patients before admission to hospital. Abdominal examination shows tenderness with guarding in the upper abdomen. Acute pancreatitis may also present without abdominal pain but with symptoms of respiratory failure, confusion, or coma. Low-grade to moderate fever is not uncommon in acute pancreatitis. Tachycardia and hypotension, mild jaundice, and pleural effusion may be found.
In the instant case the patient did not show such symptoms or signs.
14.    Based on the medical references from standard books and the discussion above it was the case of acute abdomen. Initially, the patient did not show symptoms or signs of acute pancreatitis. Therefore, OP-2 advised relevant blood and radiological investigations.  Before arriving to the diagnosis of Acute Cholecystits and Cholelithiasis, theOP-2 ruled out the other possibilities like Gastric Perforation, Acute M.I. or Hepatitis.  Thus, in our view it was a reasonable standard practice and duty of care from a treating surgeon. It was neither deviation from standard practice nor breach of duty of care. It is pertinent to note that post cholecystectomy pancreatitis is an uncommon and rare complication. In the instant case the patient developed pancreatitis after one week of cholecystectomy operation. There appears no fault or negligence while performing the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As per medical text, patient developed pancreatic abscess as sequel of acute pancreatitis, which has no relation with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
","15.    Based on the foregoing discussion, in the given facts and the entire evidence adduced before us, it is not feasible to attribute negligence / deficiency on the OP-1 hospital and OP-2 doctor, it is difficult to conclusively establish medical negligence / deficiency on the said OP hospital and OP doctor; as such, the State Commission erred to hold the OP-1 hospital and the OP-2 doctor liable for medical negligence / deficiency. The impugned order dated 01.06.2011 of the State Commission is set aside. The appeal FA 465 of 2011 is allowed and the appeal FA 297 of 2011 is dismissed. Resultantly the complaint is dismissed.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, MEMBER
","1.      These Revision Petitions have been filed against a common Order dated 30.04.2013 of the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in First Appeal No. 130, 109 & 126 of 2007, whereby FA/109/2007 was partly accepted and the Order of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Bathinda (hereinafter referred to as the “District Forum”) was modified, and FA/126/2007 & FA/130/2007 were dismissed and the order of the District Forum was affirmed.
2.      For convenience, the Parties are placed in their respective position as stated in the original Consumer Complaint before the District Forum.
3.      Brief facts are that, the Complainant’s wife, Smt. Sukhpal Kaur, (hereinafter referred to as the ‘patient’) on 07.09.2005 underwent hysterectomy by Dr. Sanjay Garg, (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 1) in Delhi Nursing Home, Bathinda. After surgery she was made ambulatory (to walk within 12 hours of surgery) and oral feeds within 24 hours, the urinary catheter was put for 48 hours of surgery. She was discharged on 10.09.2005 in satisfactory condition. However, on the next day due to swelling and numbness in her left leg, she was taken to Opposite Party No. 1 in emergency. Her condition further deteriorated and she was taken to M/s Delhi Heart Institute and Research Centre, Bathinda (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 2), wherein she was diagnosed as post-hysterectomy DVT with anemia and septicemia. After short treatment, she was referred to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana (hereinafter referred to as the “DMC”) (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 3). There she was diagnosed as post hysterectomy DVT with septicemic shock with DIC and MOF. The doctors therein informed that the condition of patient was due to the negligence of the Opposite Party No. 1. The patient died in DMC on 12.09.2005. The Complainant alleged that the operation was performed negligently by the Opposite Party No. 1 and no post-operative tests were conducted to rule out complications such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and septicemia. Being aggrieved a Consumer Complaint before the District Forum, Bathinda was filed by the husband of the deceased.
4.      The Opposite Parties filed their written versions and denied allegations of negligence. The preliminary objection on maintainability of the Complaint was raised as the Complainant had no locus standi. The Complaint was frivolous and filed with intention to blackmail the Opposite Parties. The Opposite Party No. 1 contended that the surgery was successfully conducted with due care as per the standard method and the recovery was good. All required precautions were taken during operation and post-operatively. There is no nexus between DVT and the hysterectomy. The Opposite Party No. 1 admitted that the patient was brought again on 11.09.2005 and DVT was diagnosed. After initial treatment for DVT, the patient was referred to the Opposite Party No. 2 wherein she was treated for short period and referred to DMC, Ludhiana (the Opposite Party No. 3) for further management. Subsequently, the patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest on 12.09.2005. The Opposite Parties Nos. 4 & 5 also filed their respective written versions and denied medical negligence.
5.      After the appraisal of the evidence on record, the District Forum vide order dated 12.12.2006, partly allowed the Complaint against the Opposite Parties Nos. 1, 3 & 4 and passed the following Order:
35.       In the result, complaint against Opposite Party No. 1, 3 & 4 is accepted with cost of Rs.1,000/- to be shared by them equally. Complaint against Opposite Parties No.2 & 5 stands dismissed. Directions to Opposite Parties No. 1, 3 & 4 are given as under:
(i)        Opposite Parties No. 1 & 4 to pay Rs.2,35,000/- to the complainant i.e. Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation on account of death of Mrs. Sukhpal Kaur, Rs.20,000/- as compensation for cost of treatment incurred by him at the hospitals and Rs.15,000/- under Section 14(1)(d) of the Act. Their liability is joint as well as several.
(ii)       Opposite Party No. 3 to pay Rs.15,000/- to the complainant as compensation under Section 14 (1)(d) of the Act.
Compliance of this order be made within 30 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order failing which the amount of compensation under Section 14(1)(d) of the Act would carry interest @ 9% p.a. till payment.
6.      Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Opposite Party No. 1 and the Opposite Party No. 4 filed FA/130/2007 and the Opposite Party No. 3 filed FA/126/2007 before the State Commission, Punjab for dismissal of the Complaint, whereas, for enhancement of compensation, the Complainant Harjit Singh filed FA/109/2007.
7.      The State Commission dismissed the FA/126/2007 and FA/130/2007. The State Commission partly accepted the FA/109/2007 and enhanced the total award to Rs. 4,35,000/- to be paid to the Complainant.  Further in FA/126/2007, the Opposite Party No. 3 was directed to remit the amount of Rs. 7,667/- to the Complainant along with interest.
8.      Being aggrieved, New India Assurance Co. (hereinafter referred to as the Opposite Party No. 4) and Dr. Sanjay Garg (the Opposite Party No. 1) have filed these Revision Petitions.
9.      We have heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners as well as the Complainant and perused the material on record inter alia treatment records from all three hospitals where the patient was treated.
10.    We note the Complainant in para 7 of the Complaint stated that “on 11.09.2005, in the early morning, patient’s left leg got swollen and became numb. He immediately took her to the Opposite Party No. 1 at Delhi Nursing Home and got her admitted at 7.00 am. The Opposite Party No. 1 Dr. Sanjay Garg attended her, conducted some tests and examinations, and administered some medicines, but failed to control her affliction and consequently her condition got worsened. Thereafter, the Opposite Party No. 1 referred the patient to Delhi Heart Institute (Opposite Party No. 2) for further treatment. In our view, the Opposite Party No. 1 promptly attended to the  complications and made proper referral  to the higher center. In the instant case we do not find any deriliction in duty of care by the treating doctor. In Delhi Heart Institute (the Opposite Party No. 2) Pulmonary Embolism was suspected with anuria and septicemia. The initial treatment, given was Ecosprin, Clopigerel, injection Heparin and Dopamine. Thereafter, for further treatment patient was referred to Cardiology Department at Dayanand Medical College (the Opposite Party No. 3). She subsequently, developed DIC and septicemic shock with multi organ failure. The patient died on 12.09.2005 due to sudden cardiac arrest.
11.    It is relevant to know about DVT and Pulmonary Embolism from the standard medical textbooks (Harrison’s Internal Medicine) and the medical literature on the subject, wherein it has been observed as under:-
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a condition that happens when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVT can occur when sitting or lying down for long periods of time, such as during recovery from Surgery or during a long airplane flight. The Pulmonary Embolism (PE)happens if the clot breaks off and travels through your bloodstream to the lungs. The clot can block a blood vessel leads to low oxygen levels in blood. That it can damage the lung and other organs and cause heart failure too. Depending on the symptoms the patient was treated with thrombolytic drugs. Once the diagnosis of DVT or PE made, the goal is to shrink the clot and prevent other clots from forming. An anticoagulant is a type of blood thinner that slows blood clotting. Two types of anticoagulants are Warfarin and Heparin. The doctor may give thrombolytics to break up the clot very quickly. Such type of medication be given in a hospital, often in an emergency room.
Prophylactic measure is increasing the amount of ambulatory movement for postoperative patients. Walking increases the amount of blood flow in patients, leading to a decreased probability of blood clot formation. Additionally, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) can be used for patients who are wheelchair or bed-bound. Due to a relative lack of mobility and dehydration, DVT and PE may occur among people traveling on long airplane flights.
12.    We note that post operatively to avoid infection, the Opposite Party No. 1 administered higher antibiotics viz. Augmentin, Amikacin and pain killers. Patient was also advised for early ambulation. However, the State Commission did not consider these aspects. During postopreative period  the patient was afebrile, taking oral feeds, passing the stools. On 10.09.2006 the patient was discharged in stable condition. The Pulmonary Embolism is very fatal condition developed in the instant patient and it caused multiorgan failure (MOF) and subsequently death. However, in our view, septicemia appears to be a provisional diagnosis made by the Opposite Parties Nos. 2 and 3.
13.    The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa and others versus State of Maharashtra and others (1996) 2 SCC 634, case held that  doctor is not liable for negligence if he performs his duty with reasonableness and with due care. It held that;
“The skill of medical practitioners differs from doctor to doctor. The very nature of the profession is such that there may be more than one course of treatment which may be advisable for treating a patient. Courts would indeed be slow in attributing negligence on the part of a doctor if he has performed his duties to the best of his ability and with due care and caution. Medical opinion may differ with regard to the course of action to be taken by a doctor treating a patient, but as long as a doctor acts in a manner which is acceptable to the medical profession, and the Court finds that he has attended on the patient with due care skill and diligence and if the patient still does not survive or suffers a permanent ailment, it would be difficult to hold the doctor to be guilty of negligence.”
14.    Based on the foregoing discussion, in the given facts and the entire material on record before us, it is not feasible to attribute negligence on the  opposite parties. We set aside the Order of the State Commission and allow these Revision Petitions and dismiss the Complaint.

","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. and anr. against the order dated 23.5.2013 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.930 of 2012.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent No.1/complainant was having insurance of his truck from the opposite parties/petitioners herein with effect from 05.02.2007 to 04.02.2008.  During the currency of the insurance policy, the truck was stolen on 01.01.2008 from petrol pump.  The truck was being driven by driver Suresh Kumar.  The police was informed by the complainant and the Insurance Company was also informed.  The claim was repudiated by the Insurance Company on the ground that the ignition key was left inside the truck.  The complainant then filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum being complaint No.132 of 2011.  The District Forum vide its order dated 14.05.2012 allowed the complaint and directed the Insurance Company to pay the IDV of the vehicle Rs. 8,00,000/-.  The Insurance Company preferred an appeal before the State Commission being appeal No.930 of 2012.  The State Commission dismissed the appeal vide its order dated 23.5.2013.
3.      Hence the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the petitioners stated that intimation to police was given on 05.01.2008 and the FIR was lodged on 14.09.2008.  The learned counsel for the Insurance Company stated that the Insurance Company was informed after three months of the date of theft. The Insurance Company appointed an investigator, who recorded the statements of the driver Suresh Kumar as well as the owner of the vehicle and both of them stated that the ignition key was left in the vehicle, which facilitated the theft.  Learned counsel argued that first of all, in the cases of theft, the policy conditions required that intimation should be given to the police as well as to the Insurance Company whereas, in the present case the police was informed after four days and the Insurance Company was informed after three months from the date of theft, hence this condition is clearly violated.  Learned counsel further argued that one of the conditions of the policy is that the insured will take due care and precaution in respect of the vehicle for safeguarding the same. In the present case, the ignition key was left inside the truck and therefore, it cannot be said that due care was taken for safeguarding the vehicle.  Thus, this condition was also violated.   Both the fora below have not given due consideration to these aspects and the orders of the fora below suffer from material irregularity as well as illegality.
5.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that both the fora below have given concurrent finding that the insurance claim is payable and the scope under the revision petition is quite limited as the facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission.  Learned counsel stated that the intimation to the police was given on the next day, however, the police lodged FIR on 14.09.2008.  This is due to the prevailing practice in the State of Punjab that the police writes the FIR when the police either closes the case or there is another incident in which the case can be clubbed.  No point of delay was raised in the repudiation letter and therefore, the same cannot be raised at this stage.
6.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined the record.  Learned counsel for the Insurance Company has alleged that the intimation to the police was given on 05.1.2008 whereas, the learned counsel for the complainant states that intimation was given on the next day.  I must say that the Insurance Company has no interest in filing the present revision petition because no relevant document has been filed.  No copy of the FIR has been filed and copy of the repudiation letter is also not filed.  Learned counsel for the Insurance Company could not tell as to when the Insurance Company received the information about the theft from the complainant though he vaguely told that the intimation was received after three months from the date of theft.  In the absence of any material on record in respect of intimation received by the Insurance Company, it cannot be presumed that the intimation to the Insurance Company was delayed.  In the present case, the FIR was lodged on 14.09.2008 and the delay in registration of the FIR is not clear because learned counsel for the petitioner Insurance Company has accepted that intimation to the police was given on 5.1.2008.  No such papers have been filed by the Insurance Company to prove that the intimation to the police was given on 05.01.2008 and similarly no paper was filed by the complainant to prove that the intimation to the police was given on 02.1.2008.  Clearly, there was some delay in giving intimation to the police, which is evident that even the FIR was lodged after nine months.  The assertion of the learned counsel for the complainant cannot be accepted that the police either lodges the FIR when the FR is ready or when the other items are clubbed.  The delay in FIR is evident in the present case.  In a theft case, the delay in intimation to the police is quite relevant during the initial period as the stolen vehicle can be taken to far off places and may even be dismantled.
7.      With respect to controversy of the ignition key being left in the truck, it is seen that the statements given by the driver and the owner of the vehicle are not filed along with investigation report and hence their veracity becomes doubtful. The learned counsel for the complainant has stated that keys of the truck have been exhibited before the District Forum.  It is the assertion of the Insurance Company that each vehicle has two sets of keys and only one set is exhibited and thus, other set was inside the vehicle.  Even, if one gives benefit of doubt to the complainant in respect of leaving the ignition key inside the vehicle, it is found that there was delay in giving intimation to the police and lodging FIR.  Thus, there is a violation of condition no.1 of the policy where in matters of theft, the intimation is immediately required to be given to the police. Hon’ble Supreme Court in Amalendu Sahoo Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., II (2010) CPJ 9 (SC) has observed that in case of violation of non-intrinsic condition of the policy, the claim can be settled on non-standard basis upto 75% of the claim.
8.      Relying on this judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and considering the violation of condition requiring immediate intimation to the police and Insurance Company, I deem it appropriate to allow the insurance claim at 75% of otherwise admissible claim which is for Rs.8,00,000/-.
9.      Based on the above discussion, the order of the State Commission dated 23.05.2013 is modified to the extent that the settlement of insurance claim will be for Rs.6,00,000/- (75% of Rs.8,00,000/-).  Rest of the order of the State Commission remains unchanged.  The Insurance Company is directed to comply with the order of the State Commission as modified by this order within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt/service of this order.

","The present Consumer Complaint has been filed under Section 12(1)(c) read with Section 21 (a) (i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) by 57 persons (hereinafter referred to as the Complainants), against M/s. Orris Infrastructure (P) Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Developer).
According to the Complainants, since all the Complainants have booked their respective Apartments in the same Project of the Developer, all the Complainants have entered into identical Apartment Buyer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as Agreement) with the Developer; the issue involved in their cases is similar, inasmuch physical possession of the Apartments, booked by them, has not been handed over by the Developer within the committed period, and resultantly same Reliefs have been prayed for by all the Complainants, the present Complaint is proposed to have been filed in a Representative Capacity under the aforesaid Provision. Vide Order dated 27.07.2017, the Application to file the present Complaint in the Representative Capacity under Section 12(1) (c) of the Act had been allowed.
According to the Complainants, the Developer is engaged in the business of Construction and Real Estate.  The Developer launched a new Residential Apartment Project, i.e., ‘Orris Aster Court Premier’ located at Sector 85, Gurgaon, Haryana (hereinafter referred to as the Project). Allured by the representations and assurances given by the Developer that they have the international repute of developing and selling Residential and Commercial Complexes; they had successfully launched several Residential and Commercial Complexes in different part of the Country; they deliver high quality structures with superior functionality within the agreed time frame; necessary approvals for the Project have been arranged, the Complainants booked Apartments in the Project with the Developer between 2011 to 2014.  Identical Apartment Buyer Agreements (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement) were executed between the Complainants and the Developer.  As per terms of the Agreement, possession of the Apartments was to be delivered within 36 months plus grace period of 6 months, from the date of execution of the Agreement. As per demands of the Developer, the Complainants deposited 90% to 95% of the total consideration with the Developer.  The Complainants visited the site to see the progress of the Project but they were shocked to see that the Project was far from completion.  They found that the actual construction was inconsistent with initial representations and commitments.  The Project was to be completed by January 2015 but on enquiry the Developer admitted that out of 12 Towers, it would develop only 5 Towers first and rest of the Towers will be developed later.  The Developer cannot be permitted to hand over the possession in piecemeal and to continue construction activities at the Project site for years together. Whenever, the Complainants enquired about the actual date of possession of the Apartment, the Developer kept on giving new date of possession on one pretext or the other despite receiving 90% to 95% of the total consideration.  The Complainants had lost faith and trust on the Developer and requested the Developer for refund of the deposited amount, but in vain.  The Complainants have alleged that on account of possession of the Apartments not being handed over to the Complainants within the committed period, they are suffering extreme kind of mental distress, pain and agony. The harassment is two-fold as on one hand, they are paying huge interest on the money paid to the Developer while on the other hand, they are incurring huge cost/rent/loss of rent due to non-availability of the said residential apartments. Alleging deficiency in service and Unfair Trade Practice on the part of the Developer, the Complainants have filed the present Complaint with the following prayer:-
“a)     direct the Respondent to refund the payments made to the Respondent by the flat owners of “Orris Aster Court Premier” housing project at Sector 85, Gurgaon, Haryana along with interest @15% per annum for first 90 days and @18% p.a. from 91st day on the amounts paid, till date of actual payment;
b)       direct the Respondent to pay a sum of Rs.10 lacs to the Complainants and/or other flat owners for each Flat of “Orris Aster Court Premier” housing project at Sector 85, Gurgaon, Haryana towards undue hardship and injury, both physical and mental, caused to them due to acts of omissions and commissions on the part of the Respondent;
c)       direct the Respondent to pay a sum of Rs.5 lacs to the Complainants towards the cost of the litigation......;”
Upon Notice, Opposite Party Developer contested the Complaint and filed its Written Statement, in which preliminary objection was raised by the Developers that this Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain the instant Complaint as Clause 50 of the Agreement dated 05.06.2012 provides that any dispute between the parties shall be adjudicated under the provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996;  that the Complainants are not Consumers as the Complainants have booked multiple bookings for investment and earning profit and not end users; that the Developer is not providing any service, thus there is no relationship of Service Provider and Consumer between the Developer  and the Complainants, that the relationship between the parties is of a buyer and seller; that the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court restricted the use of ground water for construction activities and there was acute shortage of water for construction activities which led to delay in the construction of the project; that the possession of the Apartment was assured to be offered subject to Force Majeure Conditions  and therefore the delay cannot be said to be deficiency of service on their behalf.
05.     We have heard the Learned Counsel for the parties at some length and also perused the material available on record as well as the Written Arguments. The learned Counsels for the Parties referred to and relied upon the facts and the plea raised in the Complaint, Written Version/Reply filed by the respective Parties.
06.     In support of his case, Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainants has placed reliance on the decision dated 21.05.2019 rendered by a Coordinate Bench of this Commission in Ashok Kumar Taneja Vs. M/s. Orris Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Consumer Case No. 2604 of 2017)  - which relates to the same Project, i.e. “Aster Court Premier”, Sector 85, Gurgaon.
07.     We find that the defence taken by the Developer in the present Complaint is more or less similar to that taken in the abovesaid Consumer Complaints. While dealing with the similar reasons taken by the Developer for delay in handing over the possession in the afore referred Complaint, the Coordinate Bench of this Commission has observed as under:-
“10.   The first contention of the learned counsel for the Developer that the Complainant is not a 'Consumer' and that he was in the business of buying and selling properties and was an 'Investor' is completely unsustainable in the light of the judgement of this Commission in Kavita Ahuja vs. Shipra Estates: I (2016) CPJ 31, in which this Commission has laid down the principle that the onus of establishing that the Complainant was dealing in real estate is on the Opposite Parties, which in the instant case they have failed to discharge or file any documentary evidence to prove their case that the Complainant is an 'Investor' and not a 'Consumer'. Therefore we are of the considered view that the Complainants are 'Consumers' as defined under Section 2 (1)(d) of the Act. The stand taken by the Opposite Party that the delay is attributable to Force Majeure and reasons beyond the control of the Developer, and therefore no deficiency of service can be attributed to them is totally untenable as the Opposite Party could not substantiate by means of any supporting evidence that the project was delayed by Force Majeure Events. Except for stating that there was shortage of water, which viewed from any angle, cannot be said to be a ""Force Majeure Event"", the Opposite Party has not filed any material on record to prove that the reasons were beyond their control.
11.     Now we address ourselves to the objections raised by the learned counsel for the Developer that the clause of Arbitration bars this Commission from entertaining the Complaint. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/S Emaar MGF Land Limited vs Aftab Singh - I (2019) CPJ 5 (SC), has laid down the law that the Arbitration clause in the Agreement does not bar the jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora to entertain the Complaint.
12.     At the cost of repetition, as no material has been produced by the Opposite Party to prove that the completion of construction and offer of possession has been delayed on account of reasons beyond THEIR control, there is no justification for the said delay. We find it a fit case to place reliance on the judgment of this Commission in Emmar MGF Land Ltd. & Ors. vs. Amit Puri  : II (2015) CPJ 568 NC], wherein it was laid down that after the promised date of delivery it is the discretion of the Complainant whether he/she wants to accept the offer of possession, if any, or seek refund of the amounts paid with reasonable interest. In the instant case, the Complainant sought for refund of the principal amounts with interest and compensation as construction is still not complete. We are of the view that the Complainant cannot be made to wait indefinitely for the delivery of possession and the act of the Opposite Party in relying on Force Majeure clause while retaining the amounts deposited by the Complainant, is not only an act of deficiency of service but also of unfair trade practice, especially in light of the view and the fact that the Developer charges interest @ 18% p.a. for any delay in the payments made by the flat purchasers, but at the same time stipulates in Clause 11.5 of the Agreement that in the event that the project is abandoned, refund would be made with only a simple interest of 9% p.a. Additionally, Clause 11.5 further stipulates that compensation would be paid at 5/- per sq. ft. of the super area per month for the period of such delay beyond three years plus six months grace period, which amounts to only 0.117% per month. It is relevant to mention here that the Apartment Buyer Agreement evidences that the basic sale price is 4250/- per sq. ft., whereas the delay period compensation has been stated to be only 5/- per sq. ft. We are of the view that such terms in Clauses are extremely unfair and one-sided and fall within the definition of 'unfair trade practice' as defined under Section 2(r) of the Act. At this juncture, we find it a fit case to place reliance on the recent judgement of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghavan, II (2009) CPJ 34 (SC), wherein the Apex Court has observed as follows:
""6.7. A term of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat purchasers had no option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the builder. The contractual terms of the Agreement dated 08.05.2012 are ex-facie one-sided, unfair, and unreasonable. The incorporation of such one-sided clauses in an agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2 (r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of selling the flats by the Builder.
7. In view of the above discussion, we have no hesitation in holding that the terms of the Apartment Buyer's Agreement dated 08.05.2012 were wholly one-sided and unfair to the Respondent - Flat Purchaser. The Appellant - Builder could not seek to bind the Respondent with such one-sided contractual terms.""
This judgment squarely applies to the facts and circumstances of this case for all the aforenoted reasons.
13.     Learned counsel for the Developer submitted that before the RERA the time given for completion of the Project was 30.06.2020 and that the Project would be completed as on that date. On a pointed query, learned counsel appearing for the Complainant submitted that he is not willing to wait till 30.06.2020 for taking possession as promised date of delivery of possession was way back in the year December 2015, even after taking into consideration the grace period of six months. The Agreement date was 04.06.2012, three years stipulated period as per Agreement ended on 04.06.2015 and the grace period of six months ended on 04.12.2015. Regarding the submission of the Counsel with respect to the fact that the Developer has registered its project with RERA on 13.10.2018, we are of the considered view that this Complaint was instituted much prior to the Registration, and is therefore maintainable specially keeping in view that Section 71 of the RERA does not expressly bar any person from invoking the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. It has also given a liberty to the person whose Complaint is pending before the Consumer Fora to withdraw it and file before the RERA Authorities.
14.     We find it a fit case to place reliance on the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Devasis Rudra, II (2019) CPJ 29 (SC), in which the Hon’ble Apex Court has observed as hereunder:
“……….It would be manifestly unreasonable to construe the contract between the parties as requiring the buyer to wait indefinitely for possession. By 2016, nearly seven years had elapsed from the date of the agreement. Even according to the developer, the completion certificate was received on 29 March 2016.  This was nearly seven years after the extended date for the handing over of possession prescribed by the agreement. A buyer can be expected to wait for possession for a reasonable period.  A period of seven years is beyond what is reasonable. Hence, it would have been manifestly unfair to non-suit the buyer merely on the basis of the first prayer in the reliefs sought before the SCDRC. There was in any event a prayer for refund.
In the circumstances, we are of the view that the orders passed by the SCDRC and by the NCDRC for refund of moneys were justified.”
15.     In the instant case also the Complainant cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the unit, as the construction is yet to be completed even after a period of more than 7 years has lapsed from the date of Agreement. Therefore we are of the considered view that the Complainant is entitled for refund of the principal amount with reasonable interest.
16.     Now, we address ourselves to the percentage of interest that has to be awarded to meet the ends of justice. Learned counsel for the Developer relied on Clause 11.4 of the Agreement, in which it is stated that the Complainant should elect for seeking refund and only then the refund can be paid. For better understanding of the case Clause 11.4 of the Agreement is reproduced as hereunder:
“11.4. Failure to deliver possession by company: Remedy to Allottee
If for any reason other than those given in Clauses (11.1) (11.2) (11.3) supra and clause (38), the company shall be unable to or fails to deliver possession of the said Apartment to the Allottee within 36 months plus grace period of 6 months from the date of execution of the Apartment Buyer Agreement by the Company or Sanction of Plans or Commencement of Construction or within any extended period or periods envisaged under this Apartment Buyer Agreement, then in such case, the Allottee shall be entitled to give notice to the Company, within Ninety (90) days from the expiry of said period of three years plus grace period of 6 months or such extended periods, as the case may be, for terminating this Apartment Buyer Agreement. In that case the Company shall be at liberty to sell and / or dispose of the said Apartment and the allotted parking space to any other party at such price and upon such terms and conditions as the Company may deem fit without accounting for the same in respect thereof to the Allottee. Thereafter the Company shall within ninety (90) days form the date of the realization of the sale proceeds after sale of the said Apartment and the Utility Charges, if any, refund to the Allottee, without any interest, the balance from the amounts paid by him/ her in respect of the said Apartment and the parking space without deduction of Earnest Money but after deduction of any interest paid, due or payable and any other amount of a non-refundable nature. The Allottee agrees that he/ she shall have no other claim against the Company in respect to the said Apartment and parking space, under this Apartment Buyer Agreement. If the Allottee fails to exercise his/ her right of termination within the time limit as aforesaid, by delivery to the Company of a written notice acknowledged by the Company in this regard then he/ she shall not be entitled to cancel this Apartment Buyer Agreement thereafter and he/ she shall continue to be bound by the provision of this Apartment Buyer Agreement. ”
17.     In the instant case admittedly the project is still not complete and therefore the question of ‘electing’ to seek refund cannot be a substantial ground to deny refund. Be that as it may, the filing of the Complaint with this Consumer Forum itself can be construed to be an ‘electing’ to seek refund.
18.     Though it is the Complainant’s case that for any default, the Developer charged interest @ 18% p.a. from the buyers, having regard to the fact that the Banks have lowered the interest rate and the Hon’ble Supreme Court has been awarding interest keeping in view the current market situation and the recent decline in the cost of borrowing and return on the investments made with the Banks, we are of the considered view that simple interest @ 12% p.a. would meet the ends of justice. We also award costs of ₹25,000/-.
","19.     Hence, this Complaint is allowed in part directing the Opposite Party to refund the principal amount with interest @ 12% p.a.  from the respective dates of deposit till the date of realization together with costs of ₹25,000/- to the Complainant.”
08.    In the case in hand, the construction of the Project has not yet been completed by the Developer though the possession was promised to be delivered in January, 2015.  On 27.08.2020, an Undertaking has been filed on behalf of the Opposite Party Developer stating that the Opposite Party undertakes to complete and handover the Flats in question to the respective home buyers within a period of 9 months with a grace period of 3 months which means that the Project is still incomplete and it will take a further period of one year or more for the Developer to offer possession to the purchasers. We cannot ask the Complainants to wait indefinitely for the possession of the booked flats.
09.    Accordingly, following the decision rendered by a Coordinate Bench of this Commission in the aforesaid case, we dispose of the present Complaint and direct the Opposite Party Developer to refund the entire principal amount received from the Complainants alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 8% p.a instead of @12% p.a. due to unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the Opposite Party on account of pandemic Covid -19 situation, from the respective dates of deposit till the actual date of payment together with costs of Rs.25,000/- to each of the Complainants. The aforesaid directions shall be complied with within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of order failing which the amount shall carry interest @ 10% p.a. for the same period.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Classic Land Developers, a partnership firm, promoted a project namely Sree Balaji Nagar at Gowdahalli and Shivanapura villages  Dasnapura Hoobly, Bangalore North, for forming residential plots for as many as 630 persons.  Payment was collected by Classic Land Developers from the above-referred members.  However, the project having not been developed by the said firm a Memo. of Understanding was executed between the Classic Land Developers and the petitioner herein,  who was carrying business under the name and style of E.K. Land Developers, on 15.01.2004.  On behalf of Classic Land Developer the agreement was executed by its partners, respondents No. 2 & 3, Mr. A. Balaji @ D.V. Madhava Rao and Mr. H.C. Ramesh.  In terms of the MoU the petitioner Mr. E. Krishappa agred to complete the project which Classic Land Developer had initially promoted.  The MoU dated 15.01.2004 would show that a meeting at his residence was held in which two proposals were given. The majority of the allottees/members accepted one out of those two proposals whereunder the petitioner was to convert the land for residential purposes as per the plans to be approved by the concerned  authorities.  A down payment of Rs. 20,000/- was to be paid by each allottee/member.  The amount already paid to Classic Land Developers was to be adjusted out of the afore-said down-payment of Rs. 20,000/- and the balance amount was to be paid within  nine months.  All the balance payments were to be made to the petitioner by way of cheque/DD in the name of E.K. Developers.  After registration, residential conversion and demarcation etc. Allotment letters were to be issued by the petitioner and on payment of the cost of the site, the same were to be registered in favour of the members.  The cost of each site was agreed at Rs. 1,15,000/-.
2.      The case of the complainants/respondents is that payment was collected from them by the opposite parties, the same being Mr. D.V. Madhava Rao and Mr. H.C. Ramesh, partners of the Classic Land Developers and Petitioner E. Krishnappa, partner of E.K. Land Developers.  This is also their case that letters were sent to them by OP-1 and OP-2 in the consumer complaint to arrange the remaining balance amount and they had paid the remaining balance amount for which receipts were issued to them.  This was also their allegations that the sites were not registered in their name despite they having several times visited the offices of the opposite parties, the prices of land in the locality having increased in the meanwhile.  The complainants, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints seeking registration of the sale deed of the sites in their favour.
3.      The complaints were resisted by all the opposite parties including the petitioner herein.  OP-1 Mr. D.V. Madhava Rao @ Mr. A. Balaji, inter alia, stated in his affidavit filed before the District Forum that the petitioner was appointed as the President of the society formed by the allottees and the funds of the association were in his name and in the name of the petitioner as well as his nominees who were his friends.  It was also stated by him that the lay-out had been prepared by the petitioner who had been allotting sites to the members.
4.      OP-3 Mr. H.C. Ramesh also claimed before the District forum that the majority members having formed a society under the name and style of Balaji Township Welfare Association, the petitioner was elected as the President of the Association and he had undertaken to develop the site. It was further stated by him that the petitioner had  nominated his friends and registered the sale deed in their names, thereby misusing the properties.  He also maintained that the money collected from the complainants and others had been invested in the project and it was for the petitioner alone to give the site to the complainants if they were entitled to the same.
5.      In his affidavit the petitioner E. Krishnappa admitted that he had undertaken to form a lay-out and allotted sites to the members of the society.  He also admitted the execution of the MoU dated 15.01.2004.  He denied having received payment from the complainants.
6.      The District Forum vide its order dated 31.10.2015 directed as under:-
“The Ops No. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally directed to execute the registered sale deed in the name of complainants’ in complaints No. 2288/2013 to 2291/2013 and 2559/2013 to 2562/2013 in respect of sites allotted to them i.e. sites bearing No. 335, 918, 617, 618, 253, 226, 227 and 252 in favour of the complainants’ in complaints No. 2288/2013 to 2291/2013 and 2559/2013 to 2562/2013 respectively or any other alternative sites of same dimension in their project and to execute sale deed in favour of complainants after receiving the balance amount and registration charges from them as agreed between them.
The Ops No. 1 to 3 are further directed to pay Rs. 5,000/- each to the complainants of these eight cases towards cost of litigation respectively.
This order is to be complied by the Ops No. 1 to 3 within 30 days from the date of this order.
It is ordered that, the original order shall be kept in complaint No. 2288/2013 and copy thereof in complaints No. 2289/2013 to 2291/2013 and 2559/2013 to 2562/2013 (total eight cases).”
","7.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.  The said appeals having been dismissed the petitioner is before this Commission.
8.      It is evident from a bare perusal of the MoU dated 15.01.2004 that the petitioner had executed the said MoU as an agreement with the allotees/members and the partners of Classic Land Developers, whereunder, the development work was to be carried out by him after getting the plans approved form the concerned authorities and thereafter he was to get registered the sale deeds of the individual sites in favour of the allottees/members subject to receipt of the balance price of the sites.  Admittedly, the price of the site was agreed at Rs. 1,15,000/-.
9.      Admittedly, the petitioner had sent letters to the individual members/allottees, acknowledging therein the payment which they had already made to Classic Land Developers and asking them to pay the balance amount towards cost of the site within 9 months along-with an increase of Rs. 35,000/-.  The case of the petitioner is that the payment in terms of the letters issued by him having not been made, he was not obliged to register the developed sites in favour of the complainants and could have sold the said sites to third parties.
10.    As noted earlier the case of the complainants is that they had made the balance payment demanded from them.  The District Forum has directed registration of the sites in favour of the complainants only subject to payment of the balance amount, if any.  Therefore, even if some amount is outstanding against one or more complainants, the said amount will have to be paid by the complainant before the site is registered in his name.
11.    The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that since the payment was not made in terms of the letters sent to the complainants, the sites cannot be registered in their favour and the said sites may not even be available with the petitioner for being registered in favour of the complainants.  Admittedly, the allotment made to the complainants was never cancalled by the petitioner.  If there was default on their part in making the balance payment the petitioner could have cancelled the agreement/allotment.  That having not been done, the inference would be that the default, if any, was condoned by him.  Therefore, the petitioner cannot forfeit the sites which were to be registered in favour of the complainants and he must necessarily make them available to the complainants and get them registered in their name on receiving the balance amount, if any, payable to him, the District Forum having already directed registration of the sale deeds subject to payment of the balance amount, if any.  If the same sites are not available, alternative site of equal size in the same project will have to be given to the complainants.
12.    For the reasons stated hereinabove I find no merits in the revision petition and the same are accordingly dismissed with no orders as to costs.

5.       As all the four Revision Petitions involved a common question, they are being heard together and decided by a common Order.
6.       Briefly stated facts giving rise to the present Revision Petitions are as follows:
Mr. Harbir Singh (deceased) (hereinafter referred to as “the Insured”) had taken 21 life Insurance Policies from the Life Insurance Corporation through an Agent.
Insurance Policies were issued in the name of the Insured.
The Insured used to deposit the regular premium installments.
The Insured was an income tax payee.
The Insured was murdered on 28.09.2015.
In the Insurance Policies the Insured has declared Smt. Rani Devi, his mother as nominee.
Smt. Rani Devi filed Application claiming the amount of Insurance in respect ofInsurance Policies taken by her son, Harbir Singh (deceased) (the Insured), who had died on 28.09.2015.
The Life Insurance Corporation had repudiated the claim of the Complainant/ Respondent herein on the ground that the 20 policies of ₹1,00,000/- each had been taken by the Insured on misrepresentation of the facts as in 20 Policies the Insured had declared to be an Employee, whereas, in one Policy he had declared himself to be a Businessman.
7.       In Revision Petition No. 433 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹5,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹25,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹4,75,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 175 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹4,75,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
8.       In Revision Petition No. 434 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹6,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹30,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹5,70,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 176 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹5,70,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
9.       In Revision Petition No. 435 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹4,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹20,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹3,80,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 177 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹3,80,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
10.     In Revision Petition No. 436 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹7,30,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹25,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹7,05,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 178 of 2018.

","11.     Feeling aggrieved by the Orders of the District Forum, the Petitioners herein preferred four separate First Appeals before the State Commission being First Appeal Nos. 885 to 888 of 2019, which have been dismissed by the State Commission vide four separate Orders dated 16.12.2019. The State Commission while dismissing the Appeals in paragraph 10 of the impugned Order has recorded the following findings of facts:
“10.    After hearing learned counsel for the appellant and careful perusal of the evidence available on the record of the District Forum, I am of the view that there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned District Forum.  Perusal of the impugned order reveals that “upon close perusal  of the two proposal forms for the four complaints filed in this forum in complaint Nos. 178/2018, 177/2018, 176/2018 and 175/2018, it is observed that both are dated 10.01.2015 and the agent is common for both. In one proposal form, the occupation is shown as employee, whereas in the another, it is shown as business/property dealer. The same agent got two proposal forms filled on the same day and did not take note of the variation shown in occupation in the two forms. This is highly unlikely.  It is evident whatever was filled in the forms was filled with the connivance of the agent.”
12.     Feeling aggrieved by the Orders dated 16.12.2019, passed by the State Commission, the Petitioners have preferred four separate Revision Petitions before this Commission.
13.     We have heard Mr. Arvind Kumar, learned Counsel for the Petitioners and perused the impugned Orders passed by the State Commission. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that Mr. Harbir Singh (deceased) had submitted 21 Proposal Forms on the same day, out of which in 20 Proposal Forms he had declared himself as an employee of M/s. Ansal Ltd., whereas in one Proposal Form he had shown himself to be Businessman  and therefore there was a fraud committed by the Insured and Life Insurance Corporation was perfectly justified in not giving the insured amount to the Claimant.
14.     The submission is wholly misconceived. As it is not in dispute that all the 21 Proposal Forms were of the same date i.e. 10.01.2015, it is presumed that the Agent must have submitted all the 21 Proposal Forms to the  Branch Office of Life Insurance Corporation on a single day itself because the Life Insurance Corporation (Petitioners) have not taken any such ground either in the repudiation letter or before the foras below. When all the Proposal Forms have been submitted on the same day, it was obligatory and also a duty of the Life Insurance Corporation to verify the same and not blindly accept the Proposal Forms. As the Life Insurance Corporation in the present case had issued 21 Insurance Policies to the Insured, this itself shows the act of acceptance of the Proposal Forms submitted by the Insured. As already referred to above the State Commission in Paragraph 10 of the impugned Order had examined the various Proposal Forms submitted by the Insured and had recorded a finding that the same Agent got two Proposal Forms filled on the same day and did not take note of the variation shown in occupation of the two Forms, which is highly unlikely and appears to have been filled with the connivance of the Agent.
15.     In our considered opinion the findings recorded by the State Commission are based on appreciation of evidence and material on record and do not suffer from any material irregularity or error. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the “Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd.”,  (2011) 11 SCC 269,  the jurisdiction of this Commission, while exercising its powers under Section  21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is very limited and we cannot appraise the evidence afresh.
16.     In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not find any merit in these Revision Petitions and are accordingly dismissed in limine.

","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Future Generali India Life Insurance Co. Ltd., against the order dated 14.09.2016 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra passed in FA No.A/16/239.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the deceased wife of the complainant had availed Insurance Policy No.00633433 from opponent by paying the premium amount on 15/10/2010.  She had paid two premiums of the policy.  The complainant’s name was entered as ‘nominee’ of the insured in the policy.  As the deceased wife of the complainant felt uneasy she was admitted to L.T.M.G. Hospital, Sion.  According to the complainant, she was diagnosed of having a kidney stone and jaundice.  It is also stated that the hospital has given her blood of A +ve group whereas her blood group was B +ve.  Because of giving the blood of different blood group the wife of the complainant succumbed to death on 10/10/2011.  The complainant submitted the death claim to the opponent insurance company on 20/12/2011.  The opponent insurance company has repudiated the insurance claim by their letter dated 02/02/2012. Alleging that not sanctioning the claim of the complainant amounts to deficiency in service on the part of the opponent, the complainant filed consumer complaint praying that the opponent be directed to pay an amount of Rs.3,19,600/- as the claim, Rs.1,50,000/- as compensation for mental agony and costs of Rs.20,000/-.
3.      The complaint was admitted and the opponent was issued with a notice.  However, despite of service of notice the opponent failed to appear before the Forum and hence, the complaint was proceeded ex-parte against the opponent.  The District Forum after going through the complaint, the evidence filed by the complainant on affidavit and the pleadings of the Advocate came to the conclusion that there is deficiency in service on the part of the opponent and partly allowed the complaint directing the opponent to pay an amount of Rs.3,19,600/-, compensation of Rs.25,000/- for mental agony and costs of Rs.15,000/- to the complainant within a period of one month failing which the amount will carry an interest @6% per annum till realisation by order dated 30.11.2015. The opponent Insurance Company preferred an appeal before the State Commission, however, the appeal was dismissed vide order dated 14.09.2016.
4.      Hence the present revision petition.
5.       Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that there was suppression of material information in the proposal form and that is why insurance claim was repudiated.  Learned counsel stated that the complainant filed first complaint being 112 of 2012 on 07.05.2012 alleging medical negligence against the hospital.  The Insurance Company was not made party in that complaint case. After some time, another complaint being 309 of 2012 was filed on 25.07.2012 against the insurance company where the hospital was not made a party. Thus, the respondent/complainant has filed two complaints for the same cause of action.  Learned counsel for the petitioner also argued that if one complaint/suit is pending in any court, another suit involving any of the issues which are being considered in the first complaint, cannot be filed as per the provision of Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC).  Hence, the present complaint was not maintainable.
6.      The District Forum passed an ex-parte order against the petitioner herein and in appeal, the State Commission dismissed the appeal by observing that the transfusion of blood of wrong blood group was an accident.  Learned counsel argued that there was a suppression of material information while filling the proposal form.  The proposal form was filled on 01.10.2010 whereas the life assured was admitted in the hospital on 31.03.2010 for few days as evident from the certificate given on 01.04.2010 by Manah-Sneh Maternity & Medico Surgical Hospital.  In this certificate it has been clearly stated that the life assured was admitted on 31.3.2010 as she was suffering from obstructive jaundice.  The life assured had not given this information in the proposal form and therefore, the insurance was ab initio void, hence the claim was not payable.  Learned counsel further argued that the life assured has taken leave for treatment of her disease.
7.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that the first complaint was filed for medical negligence on the part of the hospital as wrong blood was transfused. Instead of B+ blood, A+ blood was given which ultimately caused the death of the life assured.  The second complaint has been filed against the insurance company for the insurance claim.  These are two different causes of action and hence two separate complaints have been filed.  The compensation granted in one complaint cannot affect the compensation to be granted in the second complaint.  The insurance claim will be governed by the insurance policy.  The policy is for Rs.1,59,800/- along with accidental benefit for the same amount.  Accordingly, the District Forum has allowed the claim of Rs.3,19,600/-.
8.      It was further argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that jaundice is not a permanent disease and it may be caused by water contamination. Once the person is cured from jaundice, the person is just like any other person.  As this was a temporary disease for some time, it was not necessary to report in the proposal form.  The life assured took leave on many counts and therefore, if one application is given for leave for on account of illness, it cannot be said that the life assured has taken all the leaves for treatment of the disease.  Hence, the leave record submitted by the insurance company does not prove anything.
9.      It was also argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that the fora below have given concurrent finding of facts and scope under the revision petition is quite limited in such cases.  The facts cannot be reassessed by this Commission in the revision petition.
10.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the material on record.
11.    The present complaint was filed before the State Commission solely against the Insurance Company for the insurance claim as per the policy taken by the deceased life assured (DLA).  The first complaint was filed against the hospital for medical negligence and therefore, I do not see any violation of Section 10 of the CPC as the issue involved in both the complaints are different, even though the cause of action may be the same i.e. the death of the DLA by wrong transfusion of blood.
12.     So far as the present complaint is concerned, the petitioner has filed this revision petition on the ground that the DLA was suffering from jaundice and admitted in a Hospital.  The certificate dated 01.04.2010 given by the hospital Manah-Sneh Maternity & Medico Surgical Hospital does not clearly specify as to for what period DLA was in the hospital.  In the leave record also, there are a few applications where the leave has been taken on the ground of some illness.  I agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the complainant that jaundice is not such a disease, which was required to be mentioned in the proposal form because a person becomes completely fit after the disease is cured.  This is all the more important because the death has not occurred due to jaundice.  If the cause of death is different from the alleged pre-existing disease, the issue of pre-existing disease has to be considered in this light.  Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sulbha Prakash Motegaonkar And Ors. Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India, Civil Appeal No.8245 of 2015, decided on 05.10.2015 (SC) has held the following:-
“We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
It is not the case of the Insurance Company that the ailment that the deceased was suffering from was a life threatening disease which could or did cause the death of the insured.  In fact, the clear case is that the deceased died due to ischaemic heart disease and also because of myocardial infarction.  The concealment of lumbar spondylitis with PID with sciatica persuaded the respondent not to grant the insurance claim.
We are of the opinion that National Commission was in error in denying to the appellants the insurance claim and accepting the repudiation of the claim by the respondent.  The death of the insured due to ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction had nothing to do with this lumbar spondylitis with PID with sciatica.  In our considered opinion, since the alleged concealment was not of such a nature as would disentitle the deceased from getting his life insured, the repudiation of the claim was incorrect and not justified.”
13.    The petitioner Insurance Company has alleged suppression of material information in respect of answers given by the life assured under column No.9.3, 9.5 and 9.6 of the proposal form.  The question and answers are mentioned below:-
“Q No.9.3:  In the past 3 years, have you undergone or been advised or are likely to undergo within next 30 days any medical investigation?
Answer: No.
Q No.9.5:  Have you ever been treated for symptoms of cancer/ tumour/cyst, diabetes, heart related disease, high blood pressure, urinary or kidney disorder, liver or gastrointestinal disorder, epilepsy, psychiatric or nervous system disorder, respiratory or blood disorder, any physical deformity, partial or complete blindness, any eye disorders or hearing abnormality, mental retardation, AIDS, or tested positive for HIV?
Answer: No.
Q No.9.6:   Have you ever met with an accident or any other diseases not mentioned above which required treatment or hospital care for more than 7 days or undergone any surgical operation at a hospital or clinic or undergone any investigations with other than normal or negative results?
Answer: No. ”
14.    In respect of question No.9.3, the question relates to investigations got done in previous three years.  The Insurance Company has not come up with any specific allegations that a particular investigation was got done by the life assured during the previous three years.  It is quite possible that the jaundice may have been diagnosed on the basis of the blood test, however, if the blood test was not reported in the proposal form, it cannot disentitle the complainant from the whole insurance claim.
15.    Similarly in respect of question no.9.5, the life assured could have given information in respect of the disease of jaundice as the same can be covered as a disease of liver disorder. As has already been observed that jaundice is not a permanent disease and if the information in respect of the jaundice was not given by the life assured after being cured, the same cannot disentitle the complainant for the total insurance claim in the light of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sulbha Prakash Motegaonkar And Ors. Vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India (supra).  Coming to the third question No.9.6, I find that the answer given for this question is correct as the Insurance Company has not filed any proof that the life assured was admitted in any hospital for about seven days.  The certificate given By the Manah-Sneh Maternity & Medico Surgical Hospital is only for two days and therefore, it is not required to be mentioned against this column.
16.    The State Commission and District Forum have treated the death of the life assured from transfusion of blood of wrong blood group as an accident.  I agree with the view taken by the fora below.  From the above examination, it is found that the information of jaundice was not given in the proposal form.  However, it was not that material as could disentitle the complainant to get the total insurance claim.   In this background, the interest awarded by the District Forum @6% p.a. is set aside and the compensation of Rs.25,000/- awarded by the District Forum is also set aside.  The order of the District Forum and the State Commission stand modified accordingly.  The order of the District Forum as modified by this order be complied by the petitioner Insurance Company within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt/service of this order, failing which, an interest @9% p.a. shall be paid by the Insurance Company from the date of this order till actual payment.

The complainant purchased yarn from M/s Bukwang Woolen Textile Co. Ltd. of South Korea. The aforesaid consignment was got insured by the seller with respondent No.2 - Shindongah Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., through a Marine Cargo Insurance Policy. The goods arrived at IGI Airport, New Delhi on 16.8.1996 but the consignment according to the complainant could be traced only on 24.10.1996 and 25.10.1996. The consignment was short in quantity and was in damaged condition when it was traced. The complainant having intimated the loss and damage to the seller, they asked the complainant to contact the insurer at New Delhi. The surveyor appointed by the appellant assessed the quantity of the damaged goods at 880.895 kg. According to the complainant, the price of the damaged goods was Rs.758020.25. They claimed to have paid Rs.76945.30 as clearing charges, Rs.539787.79 as Custom Duty and Rs.880.66 as freight. The claim having not been paid, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking an amount of Rs.1705786/- from the appellant which included Rs.330152/- as interest @ 12% p.a. and compensation quantified at Rs.50,000/-.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the appellant primarily on the ground that there being no contract between the appellant and the complainant and the complainant not being their consumer, they were not liable to reimburse the complainant. The appellant also pleaded that the insurance policy taken by the seller of the goods had not been issued by it and the remedy of the complainant lied against the company which had issued the insurance certificate.
3.      Vide impugned order dated 8.11.2010, the State Commission disposed of the consumer complaint with the following directions:-
“75. Therefore all the three grounds on which the insurance claim has been repudiated are totally baseless and the complainant is entitled to the insurance claim.
76.  So far as the amount of insurance claim is concerned the complainant has assessed the claim in accordance with the loss of goods/damage to the goods found in the survey report dated 17.1.1997 (Annexure C-14) which was duly approved by respondent No.3 vide their letter dated 22.1.1997 (Annexure C-13) by which respondent No.3 had forwarded the survey report to the complainant. However the complainant has added the freight from Delhi to Ludhiana to the tune of Rs.880.66P to which he is not entitled. He has also claimed interest at the rate of 12% per annum with effect from 17.1.1997 which will be decided in the later part of this judgment. If these two amounts are taken out of the claim of Rs.17,05,786/-, the remaining insurance amount comes to Rs.13,74,754.34P (Rs.17,05,786/- minus Rs.880.66P minus Rs.3,30,152/-) rounded off to Rs.13,74,754/-.
77.   The complainant would also be entitled to interest on this amount of Rs.13,74,754/- at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of final repudiation i.e. 14.7.1997 till the date of payment. The complainant would also be entitled to costs of Rs.20,000/-. Consumer Complaint No.27 of 1999. 28
78. Keeping in view the discussion held above, the complaint of the complainant is accepted.
79. The original insurers i.e. Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., respondent No.2 and respondents No.1 and 3 are liable to pay the insurance claim to the complainant jointly and severally. If the amount is recovered from respondents No.1 and 3, they will be at liberty to recover the amount from the original insurers i.e. M/s Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., respondent No.2.
80. Compliance of this order shall be made within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.”
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellants are before this Commission by way of this appeal.
5.      The insurance policy taken by the seller of the goods, namely, Bukwang Woolen Textile Co. Ltd., purports to be issued by respondent No.2 - Shindongah Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd.  The Policy Certificate, to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of deciding this appeal, reads as under:-

THE CLAIMS UNDER THE POLICY SHOULD BE PAYABLE IN INDIA AND IT MUST PROVIDE THE COMPLETE ADDRESS OF SURVEYORS IN INDIA.”
6.      The submission of the learned Sr. Counsel for the appellants is that the appellant M/s Tata Tea Ltd. being only an agent of respondent No.2 - Shindongah Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. and the name as well as address of the Principal having been disclosed in the insurance certificate itself, the appellants are not liable to reimburse the complainant for the loss suffered by it and it is only for respondent No.2 to reimburse the complainant for the loss alleged to have been suffered by it. Reliance in this regard is placed upon the provisions contained in Section 230 of Indian Contract Act and the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Virender Khullar Vs. American Consolidation Services Ltd. & Ors. (2016) 15 SCC 308.
7.      Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act reads as under:-
“230.  Agent cannot personally enforce, nor be bound by, contracts on behalf of principal""
In the absence of any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts entered into by him on behalf of his principal, nor is he personally bound by them.
Presumption of contract to contrary -Such a contract shall be presumed to exist in the following cases:-
(1) Where the contract is made by an agent for the sale or purchase of goods for a merchant resident abroad;
(2) Where the agent does not disclose the name of his principal;
(3) Where the principal, though disclosed, cannot be sued.”
8.      Under the common law, an agent is not liable to pay damages / compensation arising out of a contract executed by his principal.  In other words, if an agreement is executed by the principal and compensation to the third party becomes payable in terms of such an agreement, the agent is not liable to pay such a compensation, there being no privity of contract between him and the concerned third party.  Even where an agreement is executed by an agent on behalf his principal, he is not bound to pay any damage / compensation, arising out of such an agreement unless he has assumed such a liability by way of special contract making himself liable to pay compensation / damages arising out of such a contract.  This common law principle is embodied in Section 230 of Indian Contract Act.  However, there is a statutory presumption of the existence of such a special contract, where the contract is made by the agent either for sale or for purchase of goods for a merchant who is abroad, the name of the merchant who is abroad is not disclosed or even if it is disclosed, the merchant resident abroad cannot be sued.  If the contract by the agent is made for a merchant who is resident abroad, the name of the agent is disclosed and it is possible to sue the merchant who is resident abroad, the special contract envisaged under Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act cannot be presumed to exist.  In such a case it will be for the person seeking to enforce the contract against the agent to prove that the agent had agreed to be personally bound by the contract executed by him on behalf of his principal.
9.      In Virender Khullar (supra), the complainant / appellant before the Hon’ble Supreme Court entrusted a consignment to the order of the respondent No.2 Central Fidelity Bank to respondent No.1 American Consolidation Services Ltd.  The Respondent No.1 handed over the said consignment to respondent No.4.  Alleging changes in the Bill of Lading issued by the Shipping Carriers, including change in the name of the consignee, the complainant / appellant filed a consumer complaint before this Commission.  The complaint was resisted by respondent No.1, which inter-alia pleaded that it had received the consignment on behalf of the buyer / consignee, as its agent and no payment had been made to it by the complainant, nor was there any contract between the complainant and respondent No.1.  This Commission allowed the complaint only against respondent No.1.  Being aggrieved the complainant approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of an appeal.  The order passed by this Commission however was set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in an appeal filed by respondent No.1 and the matter was remitted back to this Commission with liberty to the complainant to implead the consignee as well as the carrier.  The consumer complaint was thereafter, allowed by this Commission only against respondent No.3, intermediate consignee of the goods.  Being aggrieved on account of the other respondents having not been held liable, the complainant approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of an appeal. Dismissing the appeal, filed by him, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:
“14.   Since Respondent No.1 was simply acting as an agent of Coronet Group Inc., as such, in view of Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it cannot be held personally liable to enforce the contract entered between its principal and the appellants.  This Court, in its order dated 10.9.2009, has accepted the plea of respondent No.1 that respondent No.1 is not a consignee but only an agent of the intermediate consignee.  That being so, respondent No.1 cannot be held to be liable in respect of claim made by the appellants.  We think it relevant to mention here that in Marine Container Services South (P) Ltd. Vs. Go Go Garments, this Court has already made clear that defence under Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 is available in the cases under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 by the agents of the principal with whom the complainant had the agreement.”
10.    In the present case, the contract of insurance was executed by respondent No.2 and not by the appellant, as is evident from the certificate of insurance itself.  The contract of insurance was thus not made by the appellant.  Moreover, not only the name of the insurer was disclosed in the insurance policy itself, there was not legal bar to the complainant suing the principal which in any case was later impleaded as an opposite party in the consumer complaint.  Therefore, the statutory presumption in terms of Section 230 of the Indian Contract Act cannot be drawn in this case.
11.    Though, it was noted in the insurance policy that the claim, if any, was payable at New Delhi by Tata Tea Limited, the said note, in my opinion, cannot be interpreted to mean that the appellant Tata Tea Limited had taken it upon itself to personally reimburse the complainant for the loss suffered on account of risk covered under the insurance policy issued by the respondent No.2 Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd.  The aforesaid Note, in my opinion, would mean that if the claim under the insurance policy was approved by the insurer, the payment to the insured would be disbursed at New Delhi, by the appellant Tata Tea Limited.  This note cannot be interpreted to mean that the appellant had assumed a legal liability to reimburse the complainant even if the liability in terms of the insurance policy issued by it was disputed by the insurer.  In other words, the complainant was to reimburse for the loss suffered by it only if the claim were to be approved by the insurer Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd.
12.    A perusal of the letter dated 06.2.1997 sent by the appellants to the complainant would show that the insurer M/s. Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd., had after examining the claim, taken a stand that there was no proof of the damages having occurred during transit of the goods and that the insurance had terminated on expiry of thirty days after unloading from the aircraft on August 16, 1996 whereas, the damages were found and the certificate was requested on November 20, 1996.  This letter clearly shows that the appellants were acting as the agents of the insurer and as per the instructions received from the insurer.  There is no communication form the respondent No.2 to the complainant stating therein that the claim was payable by the appellants and not by them, the stand taken by the insurer being that the claim was not payable at all in terms of the insurance policy issued by it.   The same stand was reiterated by the insurer and conveyed to the complainant vide Fax dated 18.3.1997 sent by the appellants.  The aforesaid Fax dated 18.3.1997 conveyed the decision of the insurer and not of the appellants to the complainant.
13.    Admittedly, the insurance premium was paid by the complainant to respondent No.2 M/s. Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. and not to the complainant.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the complainant had hired or availed the services of the appellant for consideration.  The complainant therefore, cannot even be said to be a consumer of the appellants.
14.    The communication sent by the appellants to the complainant clearly shows that the claim was not rejected by the appellants as their own decision, and they were only communicating the decision of the insurer, as received by them from time to time.
","15.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order to the extent it is directed against the appellants cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside.  However, the order passed by the State Commission against the insurer M/s. Shindongah Fire & Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. remains unaltered.  The Appeal stands disposed of, with no order as to costs.

The complainant/appellant is a Public Limited Company running a multi-specialty hospital in Thrissur in Kerala.  The petitioner company has availed loan facilities comprising term loan, over draft and cash credit facility from Punjab National Bank, for running its business.  The appellant filed a Consumer Complaint before the State Commission alleging several deficiencies on the part of the respondent Punjab National Bank in rendering services to it.  The deficiencies alleged by the petitioner/complainant can be summarized as under:
Dishonour of cheques issued by the appellant company, on the ground of want of sufficient funds, despite sufficient funds being available in the account of the complainant.
Unauthorized transfers from the account of the complainant company.
Recovery of cheque return charges despite the cheque having been cleared.
Unauthorized debits in the account of the complainant.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the respondent Punjab National Bank on several grounds stated in its written version.
3.      The State Commission, vide impugned order dated 06.04.2018, dismissed the Consumer Complaint solely on the ground that the complainant is not a Consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission by way of this statutory appeal.
4.       The term ‘consumer’ has been defined in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, which to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of this petition means a person who buys goods or hires or avails services for consideration but does not include a person who obtains goods for resale or who purchases goods or avails services for any commercial purpose.  As per the explanation, inserted with effect from 15.3.2003, for the purpose of the above referred clause, commercial purpose does not include use of the goods or services exclusively for the purpose of the earning livelihood by means of self-employment.
5.      The term ‘Consumer’ used in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act came up for consideration of a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in Revision Petition No.2833 of 2018 decided on 06.01.2020 and after considering several decisions on the issue, including Synco Textiles Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Greaves Cotton & Company Ltd. I (1991) CPJ, 499 (NC), Cheema Engineering Services Vs. Rajan Singh (1997) 1 SCC 131, Madan Kumar Singh (Dead) through L.R. Vs. District Magistrate, Sultanpur & Ors. (2009) 9 SCC 79 and Paramount Digital Colour Lab & Ors. Vs. Agfa India Private Limited & Ors. (2018) 14 SCC 81, the larger Bench inter-alia held as under:
(a)     Only a person engaged in large scale commercial activities for the purpose of making profit is not a consumer;
(b)     There should be a direct nexus between the large scale commercial activities in which a person is engaged and the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by him, before he can be excluded from the purview of the term ‘consumer’.  Therefore any goods purchased or the services hired or availed even by a person carrying on business activities on a large scale for the purpose of making profit will not take him out of the definition of the term ‘consumer’, if the transaction of purchases of goods or hiring or availing of services is not intended to generate profit through the large scale commercial activity undertaken by him and does not contribute to or form an essential part of his large scale commercial activities.
(c)     What is crucial for the purpose of determining whether a person is a ‘consumer’ or not is the purpose for which the goods were purchased or the services were hired or availed and not the scale of his commercial activities.
6.      It would thus be seen that a person engaged in large scale commercial activities intended to make profit, is not a consumer and what is crucial for the purpose of deciding whether a person is a consumer or not is the purpose of which the goods are purchased or the services are hired or availed, as the case may be.
7.      The complainant/appellant hired the services of the respondent Punjab National Bank by opening a current account with the said bank and availing term loan, overdraft facility and Cash Credit facility.  Admittedly, the Overdraft facility and the Cash Credit facility were linked to the current account which the appellant company had opened with the respondent Punjab National Bank.  It is also not in dispute that the cheques dishonored by the bank, were issued from the said current account.  Similarly, it is also not in dispute that the transfers and debits subject matter of the Consumer Complaint, were also made from the current account which the appellant company had opened with Punjab National Bank and to which the Overdraft facility and Cash Credit facility had been linked.  Since the bank account was opened and the Overdraft facility as well as the Cash Credit facility were availed by the complainant company for the purpose of its business of running a multi-specialty hospital, it can hardly be disputed that the services of the respondent bank were hired or availed by the appellant for its commercial purpose.  Therefore, the complainant company cannot be said to be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
","8.      It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that no objection in the written version has been taken disputing the locus standii of the complainant to maintain a Consumer Complaint on the ground that it is not within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The aforesaid factor, in my view, would not be much material since the issue involved is purely a legal issue determination of the said issue does not depend upon the disputed question of fact otherwise arising in the Consumer Complaint, and the matter was at an initial stage, when the complaint was dismissed.
9.      The learned counsel for the appellant has referred to the decision of this Commission in State Bank of India Vs. U.P. Cooperative Federation Ltd. and Others First Appeal No.826 of 2015, decided on 23.04.2019.  The aforesaid decision however, is not applicable at all to the present case which pertains to the deficiencies alleged in the services hired by a company for the purpose of running its business.  The learned counsel for the complainant/appellant also refers to the decision of this Commission in FA No.42 of 2014 M/s Metco Export International Vs. Federal Bank Ltd. & Ors. decided on 06.02.2018.  The aforesaid decision also would be of no avail to the complainant, which is a company which had hired the services of the respondent purely for a commercial purpose.  On the other hand, the question as to whether a company taking credit facility from a bank can be said to be a  consumer within the meaning of the C.P. Act has come up for consideration of this Commission in several decisions including Revision Petition No.1750 of 2017 – Union Bank of India & Anr. Vs. M/s Learning Spiral Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., decided on 30.7.2018 and the following was the view taken by this Commission:-
If the business activities of a company cannot be conveniently undertaken without the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by a company, such purchase or hiring/availing as the case may be, would be for a commercial purpose, because the objective behind such purchase of goods or hiring or availing of the services would be to enable the company to earn profits by undertaking and advancing its business activities.
6.       In Subhash Motilal Shah & Ors. Vs. Malegaon Merchants Co.-op Bank Ltd., R.P.No.2571 of 2012 decided on 12-02-2013,  the petitioner which had a current account with the bank  had alleged deficiency in service on the part of the bank. The State Commission dismissed the complaint, holding inter alia as under:
""Admittedly, since Rainbow Corporation is a firm of Ajay Subhash Shah (HUF), i.e., juristic person, there arise no question of self-employment so as to cover the case under explanation to section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 ('Act' for brevity). It is a case relating to an action related with services given while operating the Current Account of Appellant Rainbow Corporation which was admittedly opened and used for business purpose, of the business of 'commission agent' and business of 'yarn sale'. Therefore, since the account itself is connected and related to the business transactions and such banking activity is required for the functioning of a given business enterprise of the appellant/complainant, services hired for that purpose would fall within the category of hiring services for commercial purpose. A useful reference can be made to free dictionary by FARLEX (on Internet) which defines the 'Business Activity' as the activity undertaken as a part of commercial enterprise.  Further, reference can be made to an article available on the internet Website Wise Geek (copyright protected 2003-12 by Conjecture Corporation) and which is written by Alexis. W, edited by Heater Bailey.  Under the circumstances, prima facie appellant/complainant Rainbow Corporation cannot be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act"".
Being aggrieved from the order of the State Commission, the complainant in the said case approached this Commission by way of a revision petition and it was contended by the complainant that considering the aims and objectives behind enactment of the Act, the expression 'consumer' and 'service' as defined under the Act should be construed in a comprehensive manner so as to include the services of commercial and trade oriented nature. In other words, the contention was that any person who hires services for consideration shall be deemed to be a consumer, even if the services were obtained in connection with a commercial activity. However, relying upon the amendment made in the Act with effect from 15-03-2003 the revision petition was dismissed by this Commission thereby upholding the view taken by the State Commission.
7.    In M/s. Sam Fine O Chem Limited Vs. Union Bank of India, C.C.No.39 of 2013, decided on 12-04-2013, the complainant had availed credit facility from Union Bank of India. Alleging deficiency in the services provided by the bank he preferred a complaint before this Commission. Rejecting the complaint this Commission inter alia noted that the complainant had availed the credit facility service of the bank for expansion of its manufacturing activity which was a commercial purpose and, therefore, the complainant did not fall within the definition of 'consumer' given in Section 2(1)(d) of the Act.
In CC No.11 of 2007, Samkit Art & Craft Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State Bank of India & Ors., decided on 14-10-2014, the complainant which was engaged in the business of export had obtained cash credit limit and term loan facility from the State Bank of India. He filed a complaint alleging deficiency on the part of the bank in the services rendered to him. It was held by this Commission that obtaining cash credit facility for the purpose of export of goods was a commercial purpose and, therefore, the complainant company was not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
10.      The complainant/appellant had opened a current account with the respondent bank for the purpose of carrying out its business activities. The purpose behind opening the said account therefore was to serve the commercial interests of the company.  The business activities of the complainant could not have been conveniently carried out without hiring or availing the services of a bank.  Therefore, it can hardly be disputed that the services of the bank were hired or availed by the complainant for a commercial purpose.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no merit in the appeal which is accordingly dismissed, with no order as to costs.

The complainants booked a residential flat with the opposite party in a project namely “Prateek Edifice”, which the OP was to develop in Sector 107 of Noida on the land allotted by Noida Authority.  Unit No.
F-212 in Tower F of the project was allotted to the complainants on 27.11.2012 for a total consideration of Rs.1,97,68,637/-.  As per clause-43 of the terms and conditions of allotment, the possession was proposed to be delivered to the complainants in December, 2016 though a grace period of five months was also available to the OP for this purpose.  Even after taking benefit of the grace period, the OP was required to deliver possession by 31.5.2017.  Since possession as not delivered to them even by May, 2017, despite they having paid Rs.1,86,24,859/- to the OP, the complainants approached this Commission seeking possession of the allotted unit, with compensation etc.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the OP, which admitted the allotment made to the complainants as well as the payment received from them.  It was inter-alia stated in the written version filed by the OP that the a Writ Petition being WP-66604 of 2009 was filed by some land owners whose land had been acquired by the Government, challenging the acquisition of their land.  The Writ Petition was dismissed by the High Court but was allowed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  Thereafter, some more writ petitions were filed in Allahabad High Court.  Towards end of July, 2014, Noida banned the construction in the above referred project, on account of some misunderstanding.  The misunderstanding on the part of the Noida was that they were under an impression that the part of the land of the aforesaid project was covered under the stay order passed by Allahabad High Court, whereas in fact, no part of the land of the said project was actually covered under the said stay order.  This, according to the OP, had prevented a full-fledged construction on the site from July, 2014 to July, 2016.  This is also the case of the OP that in the event of delay in delivery of possession, the allottee is entitled only to the agreed compensation of Rs.5/- per sq. ft. of the area as per Clause, 46 of the terms and conditions of the allotment.  It is also stated in the written version that the complainants were all along aware about the aforesaid developments and they were given an option vide email dated 27.7.2014 to pull out of the project.  It is however, an admitted position that the complainants were offered refund only of the principal amount and no interest was offered to them.
3.      The possession of the allotted flat has been delivered to the complainants during pendency of this complaint, pursuant to the offer made on 05.11.2018.  The possession was taken on 02.3.2019.
4.      The main question which needs adjudication in this complaint is as to whether the complainants are entitle to any compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flat to them and if so, to what compensation they are entitled.
5.      It is evident from a careful consideration of the written version that this is not the case of the OP that it had altogether stopped  construction on this project pursuant to the letter which it received from Noida Authority, requiring it to stop construction in the aforesaid project.  The case of the OP is that the construction had slowed down during the period from July, 2014 to July, 2016.  I fail to appreciate how the direction issued by Noida Authority on 24.7.2014 could have slowed down the pace of construction.  If the OP was seeking to comply with the said direction, it would have altogether stopped the construction in the project till the order stopping construction came to be recalled by the Noida Authority.  The OP did not stop the construction, obviously because it was the case of the OP that no part of the land of the above referred project was covered under the stay order passed by the Allahabad High Court.  This is evident from the representation which the OP had made to Noida Authority in this regard.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the letter issued by the Noida Authority had resulted in delaying the construction of the flats in this project.
6.      Moreover, during the period from July, 2014 to July, 2016, the OP continued to collect the construction linked payments from the complainants, without any deductions from the amount of the installments, which were payable during the aforesaid period.  This is also an indicator that the construction had continued during the period from July, 2014 to July, 2016 and that is why the OP continued to demand and accept the installments from the allottees during the aforesaid period.  No other justification for the delay in offer of possession having been given by the OP, I have no hesitation in holding that the OP has failed to prove that the construction was delayed on account of the reasons beyond its control.
7.      Though, the complainants have also claimed refund of the parking charges, the learned counsel for the complainants, on instructions from the complainant No.2 Saurabh Sindwaani states that the said prayer is not being pressed by the complainants.
8.      The complainants have also disputed the demand raised by the OP on account of the payment of enhanced compensation to the farmers.  The learned counsel for the OP has not been able to draw my attention to any term of the allotment letter, which entitles the OP to charge the said enhanced compensation from the complainants.  It is also pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainants that a Full Bench of Allahabad High Court had directed payment of enhanced compensation to the farmers vide its order dated 21.10.2011 whereas, allotment letters to the complainants was issued much later on 27.11.2012.  The OP therefore, must have factored the aforesaid additional compensation while fixing the price of the apartment.
The learned counsel for the OP relies upon Clause 21 of the terms and conditions of allotment in support of the demand on account of payment of enhanced compensation to the farmers.  The said clause, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
21. SERVICE TAX, CESS PROPERTY TAX ETC.: The Allottee agrees to pay promptly in addition to the consideration, the applicable Service Tax, Cess etc. levied/to be levied by the Government on services undertaken/to be undertaken by the Promoter while constructing or developing the said Unit/Complex.  The Allottee further agrees to pay directly or if paid by the Promoter then reimburse to the Promoter on demand any Govt. levies, Property Taxes, other charges etc. leviable in future on the said Land and/or Project developed/constructed on the said Land, as the case may be, as assessable/applicable in respect of the said Unit and the same shall be borne and paid by the Allottee in proportion to the area of the said Unit to the area of all the units as determined by the Promoter.  If such charges are increased/made applicable (with retrospective effect) after the Indenture of Conveyance has been executed then such charges shall be treated as unpaid sale price of the said Unit and the Promoter shall have the first charge/lien on the said Unit for recovery of such charges from the Allottee.  Further, any additional expenses borne by the Promoter for any reason for Promoter to the Allottee of the same, the Allottee shall make prompt and due paymjent of such additional sums within 15 days of such demand by the Promoter.
In my opinion, the additional compensation to the farmers cannot be construed as any Government levy, property tax or other charge within the meaning of Clause 21 of the terms and conditions of the allotment.  In any case, the High Court having already passed an order for payment of additional compensation to the farmers on 21.10.2011, the builder knew it very well that it may have to pay additional compensation if the said order was upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in an appeal against the said order.  Therefore, the said order must necessarily have been taken into consideration before fixing the price, and that is why there was no independent clause, entitling the builder to recover the additional compensation if paid to the farmers, from the allottees.  The learned counsel for the builder submits that the High Court passed an order on 11.07.2016 in several Writ Petitions directing payment of additional compensation though the said order was based upon the earlier decision of the same High Court in Gajraj Singh Vs. State of U.P. passed on 21.10.2011 and therefore, the demand cannot be said to have been factored in by the builder while fixing price of the flats.  I however, find myself unable to accept the contention.  A perusal of the demand letter issued by NOIDA Authority to the builder on 25.05.2017 clearly refers to the order of the High Court dated 21.10.2011.  There is no reference in this demand letter to the subsequent decision dated 11.07.2016.  Therefore, it is evident that the demand was based upon the decision of the Hon’ble High Court dated 21.10.2011 and not on the subsequent decision dated 11.07.2016.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the complaint is disposed of with the following directions:
The OP shall pay compensation to the complainant, in the form of simple interest @ 8% per annum w.e.f. 01.06.2017 till 05.11.2018 when the possession was offered.
The OP shall pay a sum of Rs.25,000/- as the cost of litigation to the complainants.
The amount which the complainants had deposited with this Commission pursuant to an interim order passed by this Commission, shall be refunded to the complainants alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount.  The balance amount, if any, payable to the complainants by the OP, after adjusting the balance sale price of the flat, shall be paid within three months from today.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
Heard for about two hours.
In all these matters the consumer complaints instituted against Parsvnath Developers Ltd., hereinafter referred to as the ‘Developer’ and Chandigarh Housing Board were allowed by the State Commission with direction to them to refund the principal amount paid by the complainants alongwith interest, compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement and the cost of litigation. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the Developer preferred appeals before this Commission. The appeals are stated to have been disposed of in view of the order dated 21.4.2015 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in SLP(C) No.17133-17134 of 2013. The Developer sought some clarification on certain findings of the Arbitrator in the award made by him in the arbitration proceedings between the Chandigarh Housing Board and the Developer. This Commission refrained from making any observations on the applicability of the award.
2.      Execution applications were filed by the complainants seeking execution of the orders which the State Commission had passed in the consumer complaints. The State Commission held that the complainants were entitled to compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement from the Developer but if the Developer had any claim in terms of the arbitration award against Chandigarh Housing Board, it could take recourse to other legal proceedings. Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the Developer is before this Commission by way of these appeals.
3.      Admittedly, the principal amount as well as the interest in terms of the order of the State Commission has been paid to the complainants/allottees. The only issue involved in these appeals is as to whether the compensation awarded by the State Commission in terms of the Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement is payable solely by the Developer or it is to be shared between the Developer and the Chandigarh Housing Board  in the ratio of 70:30. The learned counsel for the Developer has drawn my attention to the following decision of the Arbitrator appointed to adjudicate upon the disputes between the Developer and Chandigarh Housing Board:-
“Decision : The claimant and respondent are directed to bear the liability towards residential unit buyers, for refund of advances (payment of sale price or part thereof), interest and compensation as awarded by any consumer fora or any court, in the ratio of 70:30 respectively. For this purpose, the parties may take note of the payments, if any, already made by them and pay the balance so that the ratio of liability is maintained at 70:30.”
4.      Relying upon the above-referred decision of the Arbitrator, the learned counsel for the Developer submits that any amount including any compensation whatsoever awarded by a Consumer Forum is to be shared between the Developer and Chandigarh Housing Board in the ratio of 70:30. The learned counsel for the Chandigarh Housing Board, on the other hand, submits that Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement obligates payment of compensation in terms of the said Clause solely by the Developer and, therefore, there is no reason why Chandigarh Housing Board should share the compensation awarded by the State Commission in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement.
5.      Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement reads as under:-
“9.(c) In case possession of the built up area is not offered to the buyer within a period of 36 months or extended period as stipulated in sub-clause (a) above, the buyer shall be entitled to receive from the developer compensation @ Rs.107.60 per Sq. Mtrs. (Rs. 10/- per Sq. Ft.) of the super area of the unit per month and to no other compensation of any kind. In case the buyer fails to clear his account and take possession of the unit within 30 days of offer, the buyer shall be liable to pay to the developer holding charges @ Rs.107.60 per Sq Mtrs. (Rs.10/- per Sq. Ft.) of the super area of the unit per month in addition to the liability to pay interest to the sellers and other consequences of default in payment.”
It is evident from a bare perusal of the Clause that the compensate  @ 107.60 per Sq.mtr., if otherwise made out was payable solely by the Developer.
6.      In Civil Appeal No.10748 of 2016 - Chandigarh Housing Board  Vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd. & Anr. decided on 17.12.2019,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court dealing with several appeals filed by the Chandigarh Housing Board   against the order of this Commission in respect of the allotments made in this very project interalia observed and held as under:-
From the above, it is evident that the Developer and CHB agreed to complete the construction of the residential units within a period of 36 months from the date of signing of the Development Agreement on 06.10.2006. In the event that such construction was not done, Clause 9(c) would come into operation and the Developer would become liable to compensate the buyer at Rs.107.60 per sq metre of the super area of the unit, per month.
10. A close reading of Clause 9(c) of the Tripartite Agreement indicates two salient features– first, the liability to pay compensation under this Clause can only be affixed on the Developer if it fails to fulfill the condition under Clause 9(a) and perform its obligations under the Development Agreement, i.e. if it does not hand over the possession of the flat to the buyer within a period of 36 months from the date of signing of the Development Agreement. The second feature of Clause 9(c) is that it envisages a fixed compensation of Rs.107.60 per sq metre per month to be paid to the flat buyer.
10.1 When the facts of the instant case are examined in light of these observations, it becomes clear that Clause 9(c) is not attracted in the present case at all. First, there has been no fulfilment of the condition under Clause 9(a) for Clause 9(c) to come into operation. This is because the Developer never even began construction at the project site due to the dispute with CHB about the encumbrances on the allotted land. Thus, the question of finishing such construction within the period mentioned under Clause 9(a) does not even arise. Consequently, Clause 9(c), which is concerned with the non-fulfilment of this obligation, is also not attracted. It is notable that the arbitrator has also arrived at a finding to this effect in his award dated 09.01.2015 as follows:
“296. Consequently, if any amount is payable on account of refund of price, interest, or compensation (if and when finally determined), respondent is liable to bear and pay 30% thereof, the balance of 70% being payable by the claimant (PDL). Article 14.2.5 no doubt makes the developer solely and exclusively responsible to residential unit buyers, but that is only in regard to non-performance of its obligations. The said provision does not make claimant responsible for the breaches committed by the respondent, nor absolve the respondent from liability for the consequences of its defaults/breaches, which contributed to the non-performance of the obligations by the developer towards the residential unit buyers.”
(emphasis supplied)
Thus, given that the breach of the Development Agreement is attributable to both, CHB and the Developer, the failure to hand over possession of the flat to the buyer cannot be said to be on account of the non-performance of the obligation of the Developer alone. Consequently, Clause 9(c) is not applicable to the present case. This reading of Clause 9(c) has also been affirmed by this Court in its order dated 21.04.2015, and for the reasons mentioned supra, we do not
deem it fit to interfere with the same.
7.      It would thus be seen that even the Hon’ble Supreme Court took the view that the compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement if otherwise payable has to be paid only by the Developer, though the Hon’ble Supreme Court was of the view that the compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) was not payable at all,  because the Developer did not begin construction at the project site, due to dispute with Chandigarh Housing Board  about encumbrances on the allotted land and, therefore, the question of finishing the construction within the period mentioned in Clause 9(a) did not even arise.
8.      The Hon’ble Supreme Court  felt that (i) the liability to pay compensation, if any,  in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Agreement would be only of the Developer and (ii) no compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) was payable, the Developer having not even commenced construction.
","9.      In the cases before this Commission, the order passed by the State Commission awarding compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement in addition to interest at the rate specified in the order of the State Commission has become final, the appeal filed by the Developer having been dismissed.  Therefore, even if such a compensation was not payable, it is  not permissible for this Commission to revise or modify the order awarding compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Agreement, in the execution proceedings. The State Commission in its wisdom having awarded compensation under  Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement and the said order having become final, the complainants are entitled to the said compensation even if the order passed by the State Commission is found to be contrary to the view later on taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 10748 of 2016, decided on 17.12.2019.
10.    As far as the award given by the Arbitrator is concerned, the said award, in my opinion, has to be read in the light of the obligation of the Developer contained in Clause 9(c) of the Agreement and the view taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 10748 of 2016. Thus, the award has to be read to mean that any compensation payable to an allottee except the compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Agreement has to be shared by the Developer and the Chandigarh Housing Board in the ratio of 70:30, but this would not apply to the compensation awarded under Section 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement. There is nothing on record to show that while passing the award, the Arbitrator had even gone into the question as to who would be liable to pay compensation in terms of Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement in case the compensation under that Clause is awarded by a Consumer Forum. Therefore, it would be difficult to say that in view of the said award, the Developer is required to pay only 70% of the compensation awarded by the State Commission under Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement and the balance 30% of such compensation is payable by Chandigarh Housing Board .
11.    It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Developer that since the Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held that compensation under Clause 9(c) of the Flat Buyers Agreement is not payable because the development work in this project did not at all commence, the said direction should be set aside by this Commission. I am afraid such an order cannot be passed by this Commission in execution proceedings. An Executing Court cannot go behind the order passed in the civil suit. Similarly, even a Consumer Forum cannot go behind the order passed in a consumer complaint in the proceedings seeking execution / enforcement of the said order.
12.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no merit in the appeals filed by the Developer, which are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
This commission vide its order dated 01.06.2016 allowed this Revision Petition and set aside the orders of both the fora below (State Commission and the District Forum), consequently dismissed the complaint.  Being aggrieved   the Complainant challenged the order of this commission before Hon’ble Supreme Court by filing Special Leave Petition(Civil) No.27633 of 2016.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court remanded this Revision Petition vide order dated 28.3.2018 with the following observations:
“The matter has been called out twice.
No one present on behalf of the respondent despite service.
We find that the Bench hearing the case of medical negligence did not have any Doctor as a Member of the Bench.
In our opinion, since there are concurrent findings of medical negligence, it would have been appropriate Bench which includes medical Doctor.
The special leave petition is disposed of.
","Pending application, if any, are disposed of.”
Briefly stated facts are that on 5.10.2006, the complainant Ms. Mosamat Kanchan Devi took her husband late Naresh Ram Rajak (for short “the patient”) to the clinic of Dr. Manoj Kumar Bhagat (OP).Malaria was diagnosed and OP prescribed the medicine for malaria, but, there was no relief to the patient. Therefore on 9.11.2006 complainant again took her husband to the OP who prescribed few medicines on the same previous prescription letter and told that the patient will be all right. But, in spite of consuming medicinesthe condition of patient went on deteriorating. Then on 25.11.2006 and 29.11.2006 complainant went to the OP with a request to refer the patient to somewhere, but the OP doctor told that no need of any referral. He prescribed some other medicines and advised to eat milk, egg etc.Being not satisfied, on 29.11.2006 she took the patient to Dr. N. N. Mandal, wherein Hepatitis was diagnosed and Dr. N. N. Mandal referred the patient to RIMS, Ranchi on the same day but on way to Ranchi the patient expired. Being aggrieved due to the alleged negligent treatment causing death of her husband, she filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum, Chatra in Jharkhand. She also registered an FIR and filed a protest petition before CJM, Chatra.
The OP/Petitioner filed written version and denied the negligence. He submitted he is qualified as M.D. and employed as Medical Officer at additional primary health center, Gidhour, Chatra. He uses to do consultations in the evening at Bala Jee Medical Shop at Awal Muhalla. On 5.10.2006 the patient came to him with complaints of fever and cough. His blood test for malaria was positive, therefore the patientadvised to take medicines for malaria. Then, the patient came to him on 9.11.2006 and stated that he is feeling better, therefore petitioner advised vitamin (cobadex forte) for eight days. Thereafter, the complainant visited the OP on 25.11.2006 and 29.11.2006. OP further stated that the prescriptions dated 25.11.2006 or 29.11.2006 were false and fabricated; manufactured by the complainant.
On hearing the parties the District Forum allowed the complaint and awarded Rs.1 lakh with 12% interest per annum as compensation to the complainant to be directly by the OP. The OP- doctor appealed before the State Commission, it was dismissed and the order of District Forum was affirmed.
Heard the learned counsel on both the sides and perused the material on record inter alia the Orders of the District Forum, State Commission and this Commission.
The medical prescriptions revealed that, admittedly from 05.11.2006 the patient was treated antibiotic and cough syrup with at 4 PM Tab. Queenolar (300) 1x3 after meal (the antimalarial drug) for 8 days. On the same prescription on 09.11.2006 the OP prescribed Cobadex forte (multi-vitamin) for further 8 days. On careful perusal of prescriptions it is evident that the patient again approached OP on 25.11.2006 with complaints of body ache and pain in abdomen below umbilicus. The prescription shows medicines inj. Cefrine plus and Anafortan. The OP’s contention was those medicines are usually prescribed for Meningitis, Septicemia, Typhoid and UTI etc. and the patient never suffered those ailment. However, I note that “Cefrine” is an antibiotic; routinely the doctor prescribe antibiotic for the patient with fever. The drug Anafortan is used for abdominal pain, which the patient suffered here. Moreover, the clinical findings of patient were not recorded by OP in its prescription. Thus, it appears the medicines without were prescribed by OP without examining the patient and he missed the signs of hepatitis-jaundice to the patient. It was the failure in duty of care. On bare perusal of prescription that on both the days (25.11.2006 and 29.11.2006) the OP neither examined the patient nor made proper diagnosis. On 29.11.2006 itself, the patient approached another physician Dr.N.N.Mandal who examined, investigated the patient and diagnosed it as a case of severe jaundice – Hepatitis-B.
It is vital to go through the prescription of Dr.Mandal dated 29.11.2006. The history is recorded as:
“Yellow eye & urine – 3 days, fever -7 days, vomiting, pain in abdomen, loss of appetite” the Clinical findings of patient as “Icterus ++, BP 120/80, Per Abdomen - Ascites +, liver 2 finger”. The investigations revealed “Australia Antigen: + ve, Serum Bilirubin   Total: 25 mg%  [Normal: 0.2.to 1 mg%], SGPT- 199 U/L[ Normal up to 35 U/L].” Therefore, Dr.N.N.Mandal immediately referred the patient to RIMS, Ranchi but it was too late, the patient died on the way. Thus, in my view the act of Dr.Mandal was a reasonable standard of medical practice and the reference to RIMS was the proper decision.
To determine negligence, a three-stage test must be satisfied. (i) A person is owed a duty of care. (ii) A breach if that duty of care is established. (iii) As a direct result of that breach, legally recognized harm has been caused. The procedure therefore relies on establishing fault on the part of the doctor, hospital, etc. The person making the claim (the complainant) must establish on the balance of probabilities that negligence has occurred by the hospital or doctor.
At this juncture I would like to rely upon decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court which discussed about the duties of doctor towards the patient and the elements of medical negligence. In the case of Laxman Balkrishna Joshi vs Trimbak Bapu Godbole & Anr [1969 AIR 128], the Hon’ble Supreme Court, regarding duties of doctor, observed as:
The duties which a doctor owes to his patient are clear. A person who holds himself out ready to give medical advice and treatment impliedly undertakes that he is possessed of skill and knowledge for the purpose. Such a person when consulted by a patient owes him certain duties, viz., a duty of care in deciding whether to undertake the case, a duty of care in deciding what treatment to give or a duty of care in the administration of that treatment. A breach of any of those, duties gives a right of action for negligence to, the patient. The practitioner must bring to his task a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence judged in the light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law require: (cf. Halsbury's Laws of England 3rd ed. vol. 26 p. 17).
In the instant case, there was the deficiency in service and failure in the duty of care from OP towards the patient. The patient was under treatment of OP since 05.11.2006, OP was aware that patient suffered malaria and he treated with antimalarial drugs.It is true that, malaria will not cause viral Hepatitis-B, but OP should aware that the antimalarial drug may cause drug induced hepatitis- jaundice. If OP would have examined the patient on 25.11.2006, the diagnosis of jaundice was so evident and treatment of jaundice would have started, but he prescribed Cefrime and Anafortan without examination of the patient. The clinical history recorded by Dr.Mandal, the high levels of serum Bilirubin(25 mg%) and SGPT(199 U/L)clearly indicate the patient was already suffering from severe hepatitis on 25.11.2006, which remained undiagnosed and untreated by the OP. Patient continued to deteriorate further and died on 29.11.2006 due to uncontrolled jaundice. It was failure to diagnose and failure of duty of care, not an accepted medical practice. It was neither standard practice nor a reasonable practice, thus negligence.
The OP cannot take shelter that, the alleged prescription dated 25.11.2006/ 29.11.2006 was fabricated. The onus was upon OP to prove the same. OP failed to produce any cogent evidence before the lower fora.
Based on the foregoing discussion, there was breach in duty of care from the OP and the medical negligence is established. I do not find any error apparent in the concurrent findings and no ground for any interference.
The revision petition is dismissed.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
Vide its order dated 23.04.2018, passed in three separate Consumer Complaints, the State Commission directed refund of the amount which the complainants had paid to the appellant against allotment of residential flats to them, alongwith interest @ 12% per annum, compensation quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- for mental agony and harassment and litigation expenses.   The order passed by the State Commission was to be complied by the appellant within one month from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the order.
2.      The certified copy of the order, as per the endorsement of the State Commission, was dispatched on 06.09.2018.  The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the said certified copy was received by the appellant sometime in November 2018, though the submission of the learned counsel for the complainants is that the said certified copy would have been received within a few days from the date on which it was dispatched.  The appellant did not comply with the order of the State Commission even within one month of receiving the certified copy.  Three separate appeals were instituted by the appellant before this Commission against the order which the State Commission had 23.04.2018.  The said appeals, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, were instituted some time in December 2018 but since some defects were found by the Registry in the said appeals, they came to be listed before the Bench on 31.05.2019 when this Commission stayed the above referred order dated 23.04.2018 subject to the appellant depositing the amount payable in terms of the order of the State Commission with this Commission.  The appeals came to be finally disposed of by this Commission on 26.11.2019 and the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the copy of the order of this Commission was received by them on 11.01.2020, but even the order passed by this Commission is yet to be complied.
3.      In the meanwhile, a petition u/s 7 of the IBC was admitted against the appellant company and a moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the Code was declared against it on 24.01.2019.  The said moratorium came to be lifted on 24.03.2019.
4.      Since the order passed by the State Commission had not been complied, the said Commission, vide impugned order dated 11.03.2019, convicted the appellant company u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act and sentenced it to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- in each case.  Being aggrieved from the above referred order of the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission by way of these three separate appeals.
5.      The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that a moratorium against the appellant company having been declared on 24.01.2019, the order of conviction passed on 11.03.2019, during the subsistence of the said moratorium, was illegal.  He also submits that even the execution proceedings could not have continued after 24.01.2019 when the moratorium was declared.
6.      Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, to the extent it is relevant, provides that where a person against whom a complaint is made, fails or omits to comply with any order made by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, such person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month but which may extend to three years, or with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.
7.      It is not in dispute that the order passed by the State Commission in the Consumer Complaints on 23.04.2018, was not complied by the appellant company within one month of receiving its certified copy.  Though an appeal had been preferred by the appellant company against the orders passed by the State Commission on 23.04.2018, in the absence of exact date of receipt of certified copy of the order dated 23.04.2018 by the appellant company and the exact date of institution of the appeals before this Commission against the order dated 23.04.2018, it cannot be known whether the said appeal had been preferred within one month of receiving the certified copy of the order of the State Commission dated 23.04.2018 or not.  However, the fact remains that the said order was not complied within 30 days of receiving its certified copy despite there being no stay against execution of the said order.  In my opinion, the appellant company was under a legal obligation to comply with the order passed by the State Commission on 23.04.2018 after one month of receiving its certified copy, there being no stay against the said order either by this Commission or by any other Court/Forum.  The appellant company having failed to comply with the said order dated 23.04.2018, within one month of receiving its certified copy, the offence punishable u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act stood committed by it.  A reference in this regard can be made to the decision rendered by a Three-Members Bench of this Commission on 08.01.2019 in EA/80/2016 Rajnish Kumar Rohtagi & Anr. Vs. M/s. Unitech Ltd. & Anr. & connected matters whereby the larger Bench interalia held as under:
(1)     A company, or a partnership firm, which fails or omits to comply with any order made by a District Forum, State Commission or National Commission, as the case may be, will be liable to the penalty prescribed in Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act.
(2)     The date on which the order is passed by the District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be shall be deemed to be the date on which the offence under Section 27 of the C.P. Act is committed.  The said offence will be deemed to continue till the order passed by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission is complied in all respects.
8.      The question as to whether the proceedings u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be initiated against a company in respect of whom a moratorium in respect of Section 14 of the IBC has been declared or not, came up for consideration of a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in E.A. No. 25 of 2018 Lotus Panache Welfare Association Vs. M/s Granite Gate Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. decided on 06.09.2019 and the following view was taken:
(i)     The proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be instituted and continued against a corporate debtor, which has failed or omitted to comply with an order passed by a Consumer Forum and in respect of whom a moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is declared by the Adjudicating Authority;
(ii)    The proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be instituted and continued against the persons incharge of and responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business as well as against a person referred in Para (13) hereinabove, even after a moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is declared by the Adjudicating Authority against the corporate debtor.
9.      In a recent decision in Crl. OP(MD) No.34996 of 2019, Mr. Ajay Kumar Bishnoi Vs. M/s Tap Engineering, a petition u/s 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was filed seeking quashing of the proceedings initiated against the petitioner u/s 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on the ground that a moratorium in terms of IBC had been declared against the concerned company namely Tecpro Systems Limited.  Relying upon the decision in Indorama Synthetics (I) Ltd. Nagpur Vs. State of Maharashtra and others reported in 2016 (4) Mh. L.J. 249 and upon the order dated 02.04.2019 in Crl OP No.8869 of 2018 (M/S. Nag Leathers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. J.L. Sobhana), the Hon’ble High Court interalia held as under:
16.     Now, the question is whether by operation of the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, the criminal prosecution initiated under Section 138 r/w.141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 r/w. 200 of Cr.Pc, can be terminated.  The categorical answer is “No”.  In JIK Industries Limited vs. Amarlal V.Jumani (2012) 3 SCC 255, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that  sanction of a scheme under Section 391 of the Companies Act, 1956 will not lead to any automatic compounding of offence under Section 138 of the Act without the consent of the complainant. Neither Section 14 nor Section 31 of the Code can produce such a result. The binding effect contemplated by Section 31 of the Code is in respect of the assets and management of the corporate debtor.   No clause in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Plan even if accepted by the adjudicating authority/appellate Tribunal can take away the power and jurisdiction of the criminal court to conduct and dispose of the proceedings before it in CRL OP(MD). Nos.34996  of 2019 and etc., batch accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
17.     It is true that by virtue of Section 238 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. the provisions of the Code shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. But, no provision of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code bars the continuation of the criminal prosecution initiated against the corporate debtor or its directors and officials.
10.    It would thus be seen that declaration of the moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC did not come in the way of the State Commission continuing with the proceedings which the complainant had instituted against the appellant company u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act on account of the appellant company having failed to comply with the order of the said Commission dated 23.04.2018.
11.    The learned counsel for the appellant relies upon an order dated 01.11.2019 passed by a single Hon’ble Member of this Commission in AE/27/2019, Emaar MGF Land Ltd. Vs. Dalwinder Singh Atwal, whereby it was held that the State Commission could not have proceeded against the appellant company, during the subsistence of the moratorium declared u/s 14 of the IBC.  The said decision being contrary to the above referred decisions rendered by the larger Benches of this Commission and Madras High Court, is per incuriam, does not constitute a binding precedent and therefore, cannot be followed.
12.    The learned counsel for the appellant submits that in view of Section 238 of the IBC, the provisions of the Code have an overriding effect upon the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act.  The said submission, in my opinion, has no bearing on the issue involved in these appeals, the matter being fully covered by the above referred decisions rendered by the larger Benches of this Commission.
13.    The learned counsel for the appellant submits that though the appellant had expressed willingness to deposit the entire amount before the State Commission subject to decision of the appeal pending before the National Commission, no order by the State Commission was passed on the aforesaid offer though it was recorded in the order of the State Commission dated 11.01.2019.  The said submission, in my opinion, has absolutely no bearing on this case, the issue involved herein being as to whether the conviction of the appellant company was justified or not.
","14.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no merit in the appeals which are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.

IA/2196/2014 (For c/delay)
The delay is condoned.  The application stands disposed of.
RP/1196/2013 & RP/3071/2013
The complainant who is petitioner in RP/3071/2013 and respondent no.1 in RP/1196/2013, purchased a Tata Indica car, model DL from the petitioner in RP/1196/2013 and respondent no.1 in RP/3071/2013.  The delivery of the vehicle was taken on 14.12.2005 and the vehicle was got duly registered with the Registering Authority.  The vehicle met with an accident after three years and the case of the complainant is that the claim lodged by him with the insurer was rejected on the ground that the vehicle which met with the accident was Tata Indica model DLE and not model DL whereas the insurance cover had been taken in respect of the model DL.  The complainant therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner which specifically stated in its written version that they had shown and delivered Tata Indica model DL to the complainant.
","3.      The District Forum having dismissed the Consumer Complaint, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 01.02.2013, the State Commission allowed the appeal only against the petitioner while maintaining its dismissal against the manufacturer of the vehicle.  Being aggrieved, the seller of the vehicle is before this Commission by way of RP/1196/2013.  Since the complainant is also dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation, he is also before this Commission by way of RP/3071/2013.
4.      It would thus be seen that it is an admitted position that the complainant had booked a Tata Indica car model DL.  The only question which arises for consideration is as to whether the model DL or DLE was delivered to him by the seller.  As noted earlier, the case of the complainant is that the claim for reimbursement on account of damage to the vehicle was rejected by the insurer on the ground that the vehicle which the complainant had got insured with them, was model DL whereas the vehicle which had met with the accident was model DLE.  This, according to the complainant, was based upon the report of a surveyor appointed by the insurer.  However, neither the report of the surveyor nor the repudiation letter of the insurer has been filed by the complainant to prove that the claim was rejected on the above referred ground.
5.      The complainant, in support of his case, has relied upon the photograph of the vehicle.  I have perused the photograph which has a monogram of model DLE.  The case of the complainant is that the seller had tampered with the monogram by removing the letter ‘E’ thereby making him believe that the vehicle being delivered to him was model DL.  In my opinion, the photograph filed by the complainant is not sufficient to prove that the vehicle delivered to him was model DLE & not DL.  Ordinarily, if such a tampering is done on a new vehicle, the purchaser would certainly notice it while taking delivery of the vehicle.  It is very easy for anyone to replace the monogram and then tamper with it.  More importantly, if the car sold to the complainant was model DLE, as his case is, the Registering Authority would not have registered it as model DL.  A perusal of the Registration Certificate clearly shows that the vehicle in question was registered as model DL.
6.      The Registration Certificate coupled with the failure of the complainant to file the survey report and the repudiation letter of the insurer clearly indicates that the vehicle delivered to him was model DL and not model DLE.  In any case, the photograph which the complainant filed, was not adequate to prove that the model delivered to him was DLE and not DL.  This has to be seen in the light of the failure of the complainant to prove either the surveyor report or repudiation letter of the insurer and the registration of the vehicle as model DL.
7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order cannot be sustained and the same is accordingly set aside.  The complaint is consequently dismissed with no order as to costs.  RP/1196/2013 stands allowed accordingly whereas RP/3071/2013 stands dismissed.

This revision petition is directed against the order of the State Commission dated 9.4.2008 whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner bank against the order of the District Forum dated 19.12.2001 was dismissed on the ground that the petitioner bank had not impleaded the legal representatives of the complainant who had expired after the order of the District Forum and during pendency of the appeal before the State Commission.
2.      On merits, the case of the complainant/respondent is that he had purchased debentures of a company, namely, M/s Alpic Finance Ltd. which were not redeemed on their maturity. Since the petitioner bank was the trustee appointed by the company for the purpose of the debentures issued by it, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint impleading the petitioner bank as the sole opposite party.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner bank which interalia stated in its reply that it had not guaranteed the redemption of the debentures and its duty was only to hold and if required sell the security offered by a company, as a trustees for the benefit of the denture holder.
","4.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the petitioner bank approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. The said appeal having been dismissed in the manner stated hereinabove, the petitioner bank is before this Commission.
5.      The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner bank is that in its capacity as a trustees, the bank had filed a Civil Suit in Bombay High Court and had been able to realize more than Rs.30 crores by  sale of assets of the company,  which the bank had deposited that the Official Liquidator attached the Hon’ble Bombay High Court and the orders had been passed for disbursal of the said amount to the debentures holder. However, no order of the High Court has been placed on record.
6.      It is an admitted position that though the deceased respondent expired on 15.9.2002  intimation of the death was not given to the bank prior to 12.7.2007. Therefore, the bank did not come to know of his death and that resulted the bank having not been able to seek impleadment of his legal representatives.
7.      The legal representatives of the deceased complainant have already been impleaded in this revision petition.
8.      Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, the respondents are impleaded in the appeal which the petitioner bank had filed before the State Commission. The impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the State Commission for deciding the appeal of the petitioner bank on merits, subject to the petitioner bank paying a sum of Rs.35,000/- as cost to the respondents within four weeks from today. The parties shall appear before the State Commission  on 21.9.2020. Considering the age of the case, the State Commission  shall decide the appeal within three months of the parties appearing before it.

The present Revision Petition, under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short “the Act”) has been filed by the Petitioner against the order dated of the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Panchkula (for short “the State Commission”) in First Appeal No.1017/2016 dated 01.06.2017.
2.       The Complainant stated that he purchased a car Tata Indica Aura Quadra, with registration No. HR-20S-0773 for Rs.3,70,000/. He took an insurance policy with the Opposite Party for his car on 26.09.2011 valid upto 25.09.2012. On 28.01.2012, his car was stolen. He immediately informed the police and FIR No.113 was lodged on 05.02.2012. Thereafter he informed the Opposite Party/Insurance Company. As the Opposite Party, Insurance Company repudiated his claim, he filed a Complaint Case before the District Forum with the following prayer: -
“It is therefore prayed with this complaint that the complaint, of the applicant/consumer may kindly be accepted and a direction may kindly be issued to the respondent that the respondent to a sum of Rs.3,70,000/- insured amount alongwith interest of 24% annually and Rs.50,000/- as damage for mental harassment and Rs.11,000/- as litigation expenses. Any other relief to which the applicant is found entitled may also be granted in his favour.”
3.       In reply to the Complaint, the Opposite Party contended that, though the theft of the car took place on 28.01.2012, FIR was lodged only on 05.02.2012 i.e. 8 days after the car was stolen and the intimation of theft was given to the Insurance Company on 11.06.2012 i.e. after 4 months and 14 days. The Respondent/Opposite Party, therefore, repudiated his claim on 14.12.2012, on the ground that there was a delay of more than 4 months & 14 days in intimation of the loss. The District Forum after hearing both the parties allowed the Complaint, vide order dated 20.07.2016 and directed as under: -
“Resultantly, this complaint is hereby allowed, with a direction to respondent to pay insured amount of Rs.3,70,000/- to complainant with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of institution of this complaint i.e. 30.07.2013, till payment. Complainant is also hereby awarded compensation of Rs.5,000/- for his harassment, mental tension etc. This order be complied with by the respondent within 30 days, from the date of passing of this order.”
4.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Opposite Party/Insurance Company preferred an Appeal before the State Commission. The State Commission set aside the order of the District Forum, allowed the Appeal.
5.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the present Revision Petition has been filed by the Complainant. Heard the learned Counsels for the parties and carefully perused the record. The Petitioner/Complainant had taken insurance for his car Tata Indica Aura Quadra, with registration No. HR-20S-0773, vide policy No.25331031116100030248 dated 26.09.2011 for an amount of Rs.3,70,000/- valid upto 25.09.2012. On 02.08.2012 when the Petitioner went to attend a function and had parked his vehicle outside the venue, his vehicle was stolen. He lodged FIR with the police after about 8 days i.e. on 05.02.2012. The police submitted final report on 21.05.2012, declaring the vehicle untraceable. The Petitioner informed the Insurance Company about the theft on 11.06.2012 and raised his claim. The Insurance Company repudiated the claim on the ground of delay and violation of terms & condition No.1 of the insurance policy.
","6.       No evidence had been led by the Petitioner about informing the police immediately on the occurrence of the theft. FIR was lodged only on 05.12.2012 i.e. about 8 days after the theft had occurred. Had he lodged the complaint with the police immediately, the chances of tracing the vehicle would have been higher and the very fact that only after 8 days the police was informed raises some doubt, in the absence of adequate explanation for the delay in informing the police. The police submitted their final report on 21.05.2012 that the stolen vehicle could not be traced. Even then the Petitioner had not bothered to inform the Respondent/Insurance Company about the theft of his vehicle till 11.06.2012. He again waited for about 21 days to report the loss of the said vehicle. Again no explanation has been offered for the delay in informing the Insurance Company, even after the police had closed the case declaring the vehicle not traceable. As per the terms & conditions of the policy, the Petitioner/insured was to intimate the theft of the vehicle immediately without any loss of time. In the present case, the delay in intimating the police has not been sufficiently explained with evidence.  There is an inordinate delay in intimating the Respondent/Insurance Company. No sufficient explanation has been given for the same. The State Commission had rightly allowed the Appeal of the Respondent and dismissed the Complaint.
7.       In view of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any illegality or irregularity in the impugned order passed by the State Commission warranting interference under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Revision Petition is therefore dismissed with no order as to costs.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. K.P. Sundar Rao, Advocate 
with Mrs. A. Subhashini, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :NEMO 
","(ORAL)
1.      The present revision petition has been filed challenging the Order dated 17.12.2008 of the State Commission in Appeal No. 2232/2008 of the petitioner. Vide its impugned Order, the State Commission had dismissed the two appeals, one filed by the petitioner and the other by Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd., i.e. O.P. No. 2 in the complaint before the District Forum.
2.      It is an admitted fact that despite service of the notice of the complaint, the petitioner did not appear before the District Forum and did not dispute the contentions of the complainant in his complaint. Thereby, the petitioner had admitted the contentions in the complaint. It was only the O.P. No. 2 i.e. Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd. who had contested the complaint and led evidences. The complainant i.e. the respondent no. 1 had examined four witnesses namely Krishan Mohan Singh, Susheel Purohit, Subash Rao and Johny Khan. Out of these, Mr. Subhash Rao was in the business of repair of Maruti Vehicles and he, in his evidence, had clearly deposed that the kind of defects that were found in the subject vehicle of the complainant were of the nature of manufacturing defects and could not be rectified by repair. There is no counter evidence shown to be on record by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Mr. Johny Khan, another witness was also mechanic by profession for the last 13 years and he also deposed in favour of the complainant. Mr. Ghanshyam Porwal, another witness working as a Customer Care Manager with Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd. had deposed that due to change of the vehicle into LPG system, the claim of the complainant was not covered under warranty. He, however, has made no statement regarding the nature of defect found to exist in the vehicle. Mr. Yogesh Kamwe, another witness of Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd. confirmed that the vehicle was developing defects of and on and those were rectified. He only gave his assumptions and presumptions and conjectures for the development of the defects shown to have been found in the subject vehicle at that time. It was after perusing evidences led by the complainant as well as Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd. and after examining the documents C - 1 to 24 that the District Forum concluded that there were manufacturing defects in the vehicle.
3.      Before the State Commission in appeal, the plea taken was whenever any defect had appeared in the vehicle, it was removed to the satisfaction of the complainant. It was also contended that the steering gear box was replaced. After re-appreciating and re-assessing the evidence on record and hearing arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner, the State Commission vide impugned Order, dismissed both the appeals including the appeal of the petitioner, maintaining that there were several evidences on record to prove that there were manufacturing defects in the vehicle. Before this Commission, the same plea has been taken that there were no manufacturing defects. It is argued that the vehicle had been erratically run by the complainant and that he had already run the vehicle for more than 19000 kms in nine months and that is the reason that the defect in the vehicle had developed. He had not used the vehicle as per the instructions of the user manual. It is also argued that accepting the State Commission’s Order, a letter dated 16.02.2009 had also been written to the complainant to produce the vehicle for rectification of the defects but he did not produce the vehicle.
4.      I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of the learned counsel.
5.      It is a settled proposition of law that this Commission has a very limited jurisdiction under section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act. It is not required to re-appreciate or reassess the evidences on record and substitute its own opinion on the facts of the case.  Specifically so if here are concurrent findings on the facts. Unless it is shown that the evidence are perverse or the fora below have exceeded its jurisdiction or has passed an Order without a jurisdiction, this Commission can’t interfere in the concurrent findings of the fora below under Section 21(b) of the Act. It has been so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in “Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. – (2011) 11 SCC 269”, which is as under:
“23. Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said  power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums. The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal principle that was ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts. This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed. It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two Fora”.
6.      Again in “Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286,” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has reiterated the same principle and has held as under:
“17.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
7.      In a recent judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has further reiterated this principle. Hon’ble Court in T.Ramalingeswara Rao  (Dead) Through L.Rs. and Ors. Vs. N.Madhava Rao and Ors. decided on 05.04.2019 passed in Civil Appeal No. 3408 of 2019, has held as under:
“12.    When the two Courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact against the Plaintiffs, which are based on appreciation of facts and evidence, in our view, such findings being concurrent in nature are binding on the High court. It is only when such findings are found to be against any provision of law or against the pleading or evidence or are found to be perverse, a case for interference may call for by the High Court in its second appellate jurisdiction.”
8.      In the present case, as stated above, the petitioner has not put any evidence before the District Forum and thereby has not disputed the facts in the complaint.
9.      The fora below have based their findings on the evidences led by the respondent - complainant and the respondent no. 2 i.e. Jeewan Motors Pvt. Ltd. and the documents produced before it and reached to the conclusion. Learned counsel has failed to bring to my notice any piece of evidence which shows that the concurrent findings of the fora below as regards the deficiency in service, are perverse. There is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order.
","10.       This revision petition is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.

                                        In person 
","These two revision petitions have been filed by the petitioner Divya Ashirwad Properties Pvt Limited challenging two separate orders of the State Commission dated 20th August 2015 passed in two separate appeals 1615 of 2012 and 1516 of 2012.
2.      Brief facts leading to these revision petitions are given below:
RP 2378 of 2015
The complainant Prakash Chand Chajard booked a kiosk No. SKF-23 in the proposed project of the petitioner company after making payment of Rs.11,000 as advance in the name of his wife Smt. Umed Kumari and the said kiosk was allotted in the name of Smt. Umed Kumari on 5th May 2007. On 15.12.2008, after the death of the wife of the complainant, the complainant got the booking canceled and requested the petitioner to refund the amount deposited but the amount was not refunded despite repeated requests. Aggrieved, the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum being complaint No. 244 of 2012. The petitioner/opposite party contested the complaint by filing the reply stating that the kiosk was booked in the name of wife of the complainant under easy installments/ construction linked plan in which she had to deposit the entire amount in 11 installments. Clearly all the installments were not deposited and therefore the complainant was asked by the petitioner to fill the surrender form. As the terms and conditions of the surrender form were not acceptable to the complainant, the surrender was not accepted. The kiosk was booked for commercial purpose with a view to earn profit. Accordingly it was stated that the complainant was not a consumer and moreover complainant had no privity of contract with the petitioner opposite party until the complainant brought a succession certificate from the competent court for which the complainant was advised by the petitioner.
3.      The District Forum after hearing both the parties allowed the complaint vide it's older dated 30th October 2012 and directed the petitioner opposite party to refund Rs.3,09,000/- along with 10% p.a. interest from the date of issue of notice i.e. from 30th September 2009 till actual payment. The opposite party was also directed to pay Rs.20,000/- as compensation and Rs.2,000/- as cost of litigation.
4.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the opposite party preferred an appeal before the State Commission being appeal No. 1615 of 2012. The complainant also preferred appeal bearing No. 1516 of 2012 before the State Commission. The State Commission dismissed both the appeals vide it's older dated 20th August 2015.
RP 2379 of 2015
5.      The respondent complainant booked shop No. LG-17 in the proposed project of the petitioner/opposite party and paid advance amount of Rs. 11,000/- and the shop was allotted to the complainant. After paying few installments, the complainant decided to withdraw from the project and sought refund of the amount paid by her to the opposite party as the progress of construction was not good and development under the project was incomplete. The complainant had paid a total sum of Rs.9,07,200/-. The opposite party asked the complainant to complete the surrender form, however, as the terms and conditions of the surrender were not acceptable to the complainant, the surrender form was rejected by the opposite party. Aggrieved by the actions of the opposite party, the complainant filed a consumer complaint No. 293 of 2012 before the District Forum. The complaint was resisted by the petitioner opposite party by filing the written reply stating that the complainant had booked the shop for commercial purpose with a view to earn profit. Due to downturn of the real estate market, the complainant is seeking refund as the purpose of investment has not been fulfilled. Thus, the complainant is not a consumer. The complainant is also a defaulter as out of 11 installments she has paid only a few installments and as per the conditions of the allotment, these installments are to be forfeited by the opposite party. It was requested to dismiss the complaint.
6.      The District Forum, however, allowed the complaint vide it's order dated 30th October 2012 and directed the petitioner opposite party to refund the amount of Rs.9,07,200/- along with interest @10% per annum from the date of notice that is from 30th September 2009 till actual payment along with Rs.50,000/- as compensation and Rs.2000/- as cost of litigation.
7.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner opposite party preferred an appeal bearing No. 1616 of 2012 before the State Commission. The complainant also preferred appeal bearing No. 1517 of 2012 before the State Commission. The State Commission dismissed both the appeals vide it's older dated 20th August 2015.
8.      Hence, the present revision petitions.
9.      Heard the learned counsel for the respondents as nobody turned up for the petitioner for arguments.
10.    The learned counsel for the respondents/complainants stated that the petitioner has taken mainly three grounds in the revision petitions. The first is that the respondent complainants are not consumers as they had booked the kiosk/shop for investment purpose to earn profit. In this regard the learned counsel for the respondents stated that every purchase of an immovable property is an investment. It is wrong to say that due to slump in the real estate market, the complainants have filed applications for refund. The fact is that in revision petition No. 2378 of 2015, the complainant had to cancel the allotment and to seek refund because the wife of the complainant who was the allottee of the kiosk died in 2008 itself and then there was no purpose for keeping the allotment alive. In respect of the revision petition No. 2379 of 2015, the learned counsel stated that the petitioner opposite party had promised to give possession by December 2008, however, the construction of the shops in the mall was not complete even till the filing of the complaint in November 2009. When there was no progress in the construction of the shop, there was no hope of starting the business in the shop and therefore refund was sought.
11.    It was stated by the learned counsel for the respondents that the second point raised in the revision petitions is that Mr Prakash Chand Chajard has filed both the complaints though Mr Prakash Chand Chajard does not have any privity of contract with the opposite party and he should have brought the succession certificate in CC No 244 0f 2012.The learned counsel stated that the complainant in complaint No. 244 of 2012 is the husband of the  allottee and the allottee expired therefore, he is the natural successor of the allottee and therefore he is entitled to file the complaint on behalf of the deceased allottee to get the refund. Similarly in the other case, Mr Prakash Chand Chajard is the power of attorney holder for the complainant Rashmi Chajard who is his daughter-in-law and therefore as power of attorney he has filed the complaint. So it is wrong to say that the complaints cannot be filed by Mr Prakash Chand Chajard as there is no privity of contract between Mr Prakash Chand Chajard and the petitioner opposite party. Thus, there is no substance in the objection raised by the petitioner opposite party that Mr Prakash Chand Chajard should first bring the succession certificate to be able to seek refund of the deposited amounts.
12.    The third point raised in the revision petition is that the complainants had not paid the installments as per the demand and therefore they are defaulters and they cannot claim any interest on the amount of refund. In this regard, the learned counsel for the respondents stated that the State Commission has given a finding that no provision could be shown by the opposite party before the State Commission for forfeiture of the installments paid, rather, the State Commission has mentioned that as per condition No. 8 of the allotment letter if the installments are not paid, the allotment will be canceled and the amount will be refunded. In the revision petitions, the petitioner has not countered the finding of the State Commission that there was no provision for forfeiture of the installments paid by the complainants. Thus, clearly the amount paid by the complainants cannot be forfeited by the petitioner opposite party. In fact, the amount should have been refunded as per condition 8 of the allotment letter because the installments were not paid and therefore the allotment should have been canceled. The complainants are entitled to get interest on the amount of refund because the amounts remained with the petitioner opposite party for quite some time.
13.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents and examined the record. I have also seen  the revision petitions filed by the petitioner. The learned counsel for the respondents has argued on the three main points raised in the revision petitions.
","14.    In both the cases the District Forum has only allowed refund of the paid amounts by the complainants along with interest of 10% per annum. A nominal compensation and cost of litigation has also been ordered in both the cases. The orders passed by the District Forum in both the cases are reasonable so far they relate to refund and that is why the State Commission has also dismissed the appeals filed by the petitioner herein.
15.    The complainants in their complaints have stated that their case is a consumer dispute and is covered under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 though there is no specific averment that the booking  has been made for earning livelihood by means of self-employment. They have also not given any specific reason for purchase of the kiosk or shop except that in the complaint of Rashmi Chajard it is mentioned that due to delay in possession they could not start the business. Thus averments  in the complaints only indicate that the complainants had booked these units for being used by them. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Paramount Digital Color Lab & Ors. etc., Vs. Afga India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. etc. III (2018) CPJ 12 (SC) has observed the following:-
“13. Thus, in our considered opinion, each case ought to be judged based on the peculiar facts and circumstance of that case. Whether the assistance of someone is required to handle the machine, is a question of fact and necessity? Ultimately, if it is purely for a “commercial purpose” and not for “self-employment”, the complainant may not get the benefit of the Explanation to Section 2 (1)(d) of the Act. The buyers of the goods or commodities for “self-consumption” in economic activities in which they are engaged would be “consumers” as defined in the Act. Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show that the appellants wanted to use the machine in question for purposes other than “self-employment”.
Therefore, the point to be considered is whether the appellants have purchased the machine in question for “commercial purpose” or exclusively for the purposes of earning their livelihood by means of “self-employment”. There cannot be any dispute that the initial burden is on the appellants to prove that they fall within the definition of “consumer”. It is pertinent to mention that respondent No. 4, who is a contesting party, did not choose to file a counter affidavit before the State Commission. In other words, he did not deny any of the claims made by the appellants. None of the parties have led their evidence. Based on the material on record before the State Commission, it proceeded to decide on merits. As the litigation is being fought since 2006 in different Forums, we do not wish to remand the matter, particularly, when there is sufficient material available on record for arriving at the conclusion.”
16.    In the light of the above observation of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and keeping in view that even the opposite party has not placed any documentary or oral evidence to prove that the units were purchased for investment purpose and not for their own use and as no contrary evidence is on record, the benefit of doubt can be given to the complainants that they booked these units for earning their livelihoods by means of self-employment.
17.    It has been objected by the petitioner that Mr Prakash Chand Chajard has no privity of contract with the petitioner and he has filed both the complaints. In complaint No. 244 of 2012 he has filed complaint as husband of the allottee and in the second complaint 293 of 2012 he has filed complaint on behalf of the allottee as power of attorney holder and also being the father-in-law of the allottee. In fact, it is mentioned in the revision petition that the petitioner had asked him to bring the succession certificate  so that the amount could be refunded. The objection raised in the complaint No. 244 of 2012 seems to be a valid objection however, keeping in view the fact that the amount of refund is only about Rs.3 lakhs and the complainant is the husband of the deceased allottee and no other person has come forward to claim this amount, the State Commission has rightly ignored the objection and has allowed the refund to the complainant. In respect of the complaint No. 293 of 2012, it is clear that the complaint has been filed on behalf of the complainant by Mr Prakash Chand Chajard on the basis of the power of attorney. Clearly if the complaint has been allowed, the amount of refund will be given by way of demand draft in the name of the actual complainant and not in the name of the power of attorney holder.
18.    An argument also has been raised in the revision petition that the complainants are defaulters as they have not paid installments as per the demand by the petitioner given in the allotment letter and therefore they are not entitled to any interest even if the amount is refunded to them. The State Commission has mentioned that nothing could be shown by the petitioner that there was a provision in the allotment letter for forfeiting the installments paid or the booking amount. The State Commission has also mentioned that condition No. 8 of the allotment letter states that if the installments are not paid, the allotment will be canceled and amount will be refunded. Based on this provision, the amount paid by the complainants has been ordered to be refunded by the State Commission. Even in the revision petitions, no ground has been taken that the finding of the State Commission is wrong and there is some provision for forfeiture of the installments or the booking amount. Therefore it is certain that there is no provision for forfeiture of the installments or the earnest money in the form of booking amount. If the installments were not paid by the complainants, the petitioner opposite party should have cancelled the allotment as per condition No. 8 of the allotment letter and should have refunded the amount, however this has not been done rather, the surrender form has also not been accepted by the opposite party. In these circumstances, the State Commission is right in ordering refund of the amounts paid by the complainants.
19.    The question now arises for the rate of interest to be given on this amount of refund. The agreement between the parties in the form of allotment letter does not provide for any interest as per condition 8 of the allotment letter. The position in respect of the deficiency in service on the part of the opposite party is also not clear. In the complaints, it is only mentioned that the opposite party had promised to complete the construction by the end of December 2008 and to give the possession however, no such document is on record. The date of completion of the construction and the date of handing over the possession is not clear and the complainant has not provided any information in this regard which is based on documentary evidence. It has not been made clear in the complaints as to which provision of the agreement has been violated. Thus, in my view, the only deficiency on the part of the opposite party is that the opposite party has not refunded the amount as per condition No. 8 of the allotment letter after the installments were not paid and there was a request for refund of the amount. The opposite party should have disposed of the application for surrender/refund as per the provisions of the allotment letter which has not been done by the opposite party. The booking has been made in the month of May 2007 and the application for surrender/refund was filed by the end of the year 2008 on the ground of slow progress in the project. The ground is not something that is easily palatable. In these circumstances, there seems to be no justification for award of interest at the rate of 10% per annum. If one strictly goes by the agreement, no interest is payable to the complainants, however, as the amount has remained with the opposite party, the complainants deserve some interest on the deposited amount in the light of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Alok Shanker Pandey Vs. Union of India &Ors., II (2007) CPJ 3 (SC) where the following has been observed:-
“9.  It may be mentioned that there is misconception about interest.  Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but it is the normal accretion on capital.  For example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10 years ago, but he offers that amount to him today, then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount.  Had A paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B would have invested that amount somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on it for this period.  Hence equity demands that A should not only pay back the principal amount but also the interest thereon to B.”
20.    On the basis of the above examination and in the facts and circumstances of the case, I deem it appropriate to allow an interest of 6% per annum on the amount of refund instead of 10% as awarded by the District Forum and confirmed by the State Commission.
21.    Based on the above discussion, the revision petitions are partly allowed and the orders of the fora below are modified to the extent that the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum instead of 10% per annum. Rest of the order passed by the District Forum in both cases is maintained. The orders of the District Forum as modified by this order be complied by the petitioner opposite party within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

1.       The present Appeal is filed by the Appellants under Section-19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against Order passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the “State Commission”) in Complaint No.216/2007 dated 21.01.2009.
2.       The case of the Complainant is that he purchased a Ford Endeavour Sports Utility Vehicle for Rs.13,57,000/- from Respondent No.2/Opposite Party No.2, who was the authorized dealer of Ford India Pvt. Ltd. The vehicle was insured with the Appellant/Opposite Party No.1 ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. at a premium of Rs.50,550/-, vide covering note No.PC1534231 dated 28.02.2006 from 28.02.2006 to 27.02.2007. The said vehicle met with an accident near Ludhiana on 08.12.2006. The vehicle was badly damaged and the police was intimated about the accident. The front body of the vehicle was crushed like paper. The Complainant contended that the air bag also failed to inflate. The wind screen was broken and injured the Complainant. On 11.12.2006, the vehicle was towed to the workshop of Respondent No.2 for inspection and assessment of loss. The vehicle was inspected by the technical staff and the cost of repair was assessed at Rs.14 lakhs. The body shell was damaged and chassis was cracked and needed replacement. Insurance claim for the same was lodged with the Appellant-Insurance Company to pay the sum assured, as the cost of repair was estimated to be more than the cost of the new vehicle, treating it as a total loss. The Appellant in collusion with Respondent No.2, however, approved a sum of Rs.3 lakhs for carrying out the repair rather than pay the sum assured. As late as on 31.03.2007 Respondent No.2 informed the Complainant that the vehicle had been repaired and would be released on payment of Rs.4,81,148/- towards repair charges. In May, 2007 he was further informed to pay Rs.1,91,000/-, as the balance amount was to  be paid by the appellant Company. The Complainant upon inspection noticed that the brakes were not working and hence the vehicle could not be taken on a test drive. Respondent No.2 was also unable to give any assurance regarding the safety of the vehicle, and that the vehicle had been restored to its original condition. It was also admitted by Respondent No.2 that “The Accidental deformities can be removed only by replacement of the body of the vehicle.” Refusal of the Appellant and Respondent No.2 to get the vehicle fully restored to its original condition, thus, amounted to deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. A Complaint was, therefore, filed before the State Commission with the following prayer: -
“(a)   Direct the OP1 to pay the claim to the complainant to the extent of the IDV i.e. Insured’s declared value of Rs.13,03,400/- as it is a case of total loss and the vehicle cannot be made roadworthy again to its condition at the time of accident;
In the alternative, to relief (a)
Direct the OP1 and OP2 to repair the said vehicle to the fullest as per original estimate of OP2 to make it roadworthy by replacing the broken chassis and the damaged body shell etc. to restore the vehicle to its original condition to remove all the deformities from the vehicle;
Direct the OP1 to bear all expenses of repair without deducting/disallowing expense for any of the parts; and,
Direct the OP1 and OP2 to extend the warranty to the so repaired vehicle and ensure its safety and roadworthiness owing to the broken chassis and damaged body shell;
(b)     Award a sum of Rs.500,000/- towards distress, harassment, mental agony, loss of work, tax cost and out of pocket expenses;
(c)      Award a sum of Rs.4,90,500/- on account of loss of use of vehicle by the complainant since 08.12.2006 the day of accident till 31.10.2007 and thereafter at the rate of Rs.1500/- per day for each day;
(d)     Award the crane charges amounting to Rs.12,000/-;
(e)      Award the cost on account of the depreciation of the vehicle due to its non-use amounting to Rs.1,30,340/- calculated @ 10% being the rate prescribed by OP1.
(f)      Award a sum of Rs.97,843/- being the interest paid by the complainant on the loan amount despite the fact that the vehicle could not be used from the date of accident till October, 2007;
(g)     Allow the cost of the complaint alongwith interest @ 18% per annum on the amounts claimed.
Any other relief which the Hon’ble Commission may deem fit and proper under the circumstances of the case may also be awarded in favour of the complainant and against the Respondents.”
3.       The Appellant contested the case that though the vehicle did suffer damages, the estimate of Rs.14 lakhs was highly exaggerated. Surveyor Mr. J.K. Sharma was appointed, who submitted his report on 04.06.2007. He found that the vehicle was in repairable condition and after discussing with the representative of Respondent No.2 did not recommend the vehicle for total loss. The Appellant had approved a sum of Rs.3 lakhs for carrying out the repair of the vehicle on the recommendation of the surveyor and that the Complainant had agreed to the same. The estimate of Rs.14 lakhs was prepared at the insistence of the Complainant and the same was not binding on the Appellants. Repair work was started only after seeking consent of the Complainant.
4.       Respondent No.2/Opposite Party No.2 denied all liabilities stating that the contract was basically between the Complainant and Respondent No.1. The vehicle was brought to its workshop and it was found that the body as well as the chassis of the vehicle were badly damaged and both of them required replacement. The entire replacement cost was worked out to Rs.14 lakhs but the Appellant rejected the estimate and advised for its repair. Respondent No.2 undertook repair of the vehicle as per the direction of the Complainant and there was no deficiency on its part. The Complainant had not paid the bill amounts to Respondent No.2 and therefore recovery suit had been filed in Tis Hazari Court, which was still pending. The delay in executing the repair work was due to the fact that parts of the vehicle had to be sourced from different places and the Complainant was kept informed of the entire process. The vehicle was fully repaired and there was no deficiency on the part of Respondent No.2.
5.       The State Commission after going through the evidence and documents placed on record and hearing the arguments of both the parties directed as follows:-
“(i)    OP No.1 shall pay to the Complainant the insured value of the vehicle in question less 5% depreciated value as the vehicle was only ten months old at the time of accident. The complainant shall on payment of the said amount take necessary steps to transfer the registration in the name of the OP No.1 Insurance Company and hand over the keys etc. In the circumstances no further compensation is called for.
(ii)     Op No.1 shall also pay the cost of litigation to the extent of Rs.10,000/- to the Complainant.
(iii)    OP No.1 shall pay the entire amount of Rs.4,81,148/- to OP No.2 for the repairs of the vehicle.
(iv)    On payment of the said amount, OP No.2 shall hand over the vehicle to OP No.1 Insurance Company without claiming any further charges either from the OP No.1 or from the Complainant.”
6.       Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the Appellants filed the present Appeal. Heard the learned Counsel for the parties and carefully perused the material on record.
7.       Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the State Commission passed the impugned order without properly appreciating the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the extent of indemnification. The impugned order was passed ignoring the report of the surveyor that the vehicle had been repaired. The delay in repair by Respondent No.2 was on account of the manufacturer’s lukewarm attitude for which the Appellant was not responsible. It was submitted that the State Commission passed the impugned order without jurisdiction and interfered with the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.
8.       Learned Counsel for Respondent No.1/Complainant submitted that the vehicle was insured with the Appellant and the accident occurred during the currency of the insurance policy. After repair of the vehicle neither the Insurance Company nor the Dealer gave any assurance as to the safety of the vehicle and that the vehicle had been restored to its original condition. The Appellant Insurance Company was, therefore, liable to pay the sum assured to the Complainant. None appeared on behalf of Respondent No.2/Dealer.
9.       Admittedly a Ford Endeavour SUV was purchased by Respondent No.1/Complainant for Rs.13,57,000/- with registration No.DL-3C- AN 0889 from Respondent No.2. Complainant had also taken an insurance policy from the Appellant/ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. by paying premium of Rs.50,550/-, vide cover note No.PCI534231 dated 28.02.2006, valid from 28.02.2006 to 27.02.2007. During the validity of the insurance the vehicle met with an accident near Ludhiana on 08.12.2006, while the Complainant was returning from Jalandhar to Delhi alongwith his daughter. The vehicle was damaged and injured the Complainant, who also suffered minor injuries. Originally an estimate of Rs.14 lakhs was prepared by Respondent No.2 which involved replacement of several parts. Based on the Surveyor’s report, however, at the behest of the Appellant/Insurance Company the vehicle was taken up for repair by Respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 after repairing the vehicle sought payment and delivery of the vehicle. The Complainant, however, did not pay the amount demanded nor took delivery of the vehicle. Suit was filed by Respondent No.2 for recovery of the amount.
10.     Originally the Complainant and the dealer prepared an estimate of Rs.14 lakhs for repair of the vehicle. The dealer found the body and chassis fully damaged and held that both needed replacement. Its cost was assessed at Rs.14 lakhs. The insurer, however, rejected the estimate and on his advice repair was undertaken and accordingly the Complainant ordered for repair of the vehicle. As the cost of the vehicle or the Insured Declared Value was more than the cost of repair, the Complainant claimed the sum assured in the policy. The Appellant, Insurance Company, however, appointed a Surveyor and based on his report got the vehicle repaired, despite the contrary view held by the Complainant and Respondent No.2. Though the vehicle was badly damaged and needed replacement, the Insurance Company insisted on repair of the vehicle by Respondent No.2.
11.     Complainant upon inspection of the vehicle did notice that the brakes of the vehicle were not functioning and this fact was not denied by Respondent No.2. Respondent No.2 also refused to give any assurance as to the roadworthiness of the said vehicle after the repair. Respondent No.2 could not admit that the vehicle was restored to its original condition and take the responsibility for the smooth running of the vehicle and safety of the occupants. He also admitted that the accidental deformities could only be removed by replacing the body of the vehicle. It is, thus, seen that though the vehicle got damaged badly in the accident, the Appellant- Insurance Company was not willing to concede to declare total loss of the vehicle and give the sum assured to the Complainant. The State Commission, therefore, rightly held that the Appellant shied away from their obligation under the contract of insurance.
","12.     In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion that the impugned order passed by the State Commission was justified. Appellant failed to point any illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the State Commission, warranting interference in exercise of Appellate jurisdiction under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to cost.

  For the Petitioner     :Mr. Prasanta Banerjee, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Surojit Banerjee, Advocate 
","1.       Revision Petition has been filed by the Petitioner under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the order passed by the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in First Appeal No.537/2015 dated 15.03.2017.
2.       Case of the Respondent/Complainant is that he had made a payment of Rs.25,050/- out of the total consideration amount of Rs.7,06,000/- and booked a flat with the Petitioner/Opposite Party. The Petitioner did not complete the flat despite several requests made by the Respondent for completion of the same. Aggrieved by the delay in completion of the pending works, the Respondent filed a complaint case before the District Forum with following prayer: -
“A     An order for directing the opposite parties jointly or severally to execute and register the deed of conveyance in respect of the flat of the petitioner more fully and specifically described in schedule below in favour of the petitioner, failing which the deed of conveyance may be registered through court/forum; and
B.      An order for  directing all the opposite parties jointly or severally to deliver the peaceful vacant physical possession of the said flat of the petitioners more fully and specifically described in schedule below in favour of the petitioner, failing which the deed of conveyance may be registered through court/forum; and
C.      An order for directing all the opposite parties jointly and/or severally to bear/pay the enhanced cost of registration if and as to be determined by the Ld. Forum and
D.      An order for directing all the opposite parties no. 1 to 2 jointly and/or severally to pay Rs.7,00,000/- compensation for harassment, mental agony and also for negligent act and conducting the deficiency in service; and
E.      An order for directing all opposite parties jointly and/or severally to take the completion certificate with regard to said multistoried building including all facts as per sanctioned plan from the local Municipality and to hand over the same to the representative petitioner; and
F.      An order for directing the all opposite parties jointly and/or severally to provide the all sorts of common facilities in respect of the suit flat and building, in favour of the petitioner; and
H.      All cost of the proceeding; and
I.       All other relief/reliefs as the petitioner is entitled to get in law and equity.”
3.       The District Forum allowed the Complaint ex-parte against the Petitioners, imposing a cost of Rs.5,000/-. The District Forum ordered as follows: -
“That the case be and the same is allowed ex-parte against the O.P. no. 1 & 2, with the cost of Rs.5,000/- only.
That the O.P. no. 1 & 2 are jointly and severally directed to hand over the actual vacant possession of the said three bed rooms flat in question, on payment of balance consideration money of Rs.6,81,000/- only, within a period of one month from the date of payment of balance consideration money.
That the O.P. no. 1 & 2 are jointly and severally directed to execute and register appropriate Deed of Conveyance, in favour of the complainant in respect of the said flat within a period of one month from the date of payment of the balance consideration money.
That the O.P. no. 1 & 2 are jointly and severally directed to pay a sum of Rs. 5,000/- only as compensation for harassment and mental agony, within one month from the date of this order.
In the event of non-compliance of any portion of the executable order by any of the O.Ps within the above specified period, the said O.Ps shall have to pay a sum of Rs.200/- per day from the date of this order till its realization, as punitive damages, which shall be deposited by the O.Ps in the State Consumer Welfare Fund.”
","4.       Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the Petitioners filed an Appeal before the State Commission. The State Commission heard both the parties and dismissed the Appeal as it was bereft of any merit to be entertained. Against the concurrent findings of both the Fora below, the Petitioners have filed the present Revision Petition before this Commission.
5.       Heard learned counsel for the parties. This is a case where the Complainant made part payment of Rs.25,050/- out of a total consideration of Rs.7,06,000/- for purchase of a flat whose construction got delayed. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the payment of instalment was withheld by the Respondent/Complainant, which led to the cancellation of the booking in terms of clause No.13 of the terms and conditions of the allotment. The reason for non-payment of the balance amount within the time schedule was non-sanction of funds by the Bank for want of required papers which were supposed to be supplied by the Petitioners/Opposite Parties. The State Commission observed that this averment was not controverted by the Appellants/Opposite Parties and, therefore, could be relied upon. Further the learned Counsel for the Respondent/Complainant at the time of argument before the State Commission referred to a letter issued by the Appellants/Opposite Parties to the Respondent/complainant, after the orders of the District Forum were delivered, requesting the Respondent/Complainant to take possession of the flat and get the conveyance deed registered. This indicated the inclination of the Petitioners for carrying out the orders passed by the District Forum. Keeping in view the above, the State Commission did not find any necessity to interfere with the order of the District Forum and dismissed the Appeal on contest without any cost and confirmed the order of the District Forum.
6.       Jurisdiction of this Commission under Section 21 (b) is very limited. This Commission is not required to re-appreciate and reassess the evidences and reach to its own conclusion. The Court can intervene only when the petitioner succeeds in showing that the Fora below has wrongly exercised its jurisdiction or there is a miscarriage of justice. It was so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta Vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd. (2011) 11 SCC 269  has held as under: -
“13.        Also, it is to be noted that the revisional powers of the National Commission are derived from Section 21 (b) of the Act, under which the said power can be exercised only if there is some prima facie jurisdictional error appearing in the impugned order, and only then, may the same be set aside. In our considered opinion there was no jurisdictional error or miscarriage of justice, which could have warranted the National Commission to have taken a different view than what was taken by the two Forums.  The decision of the National Commission rests not on the basis of some legal  principle  that  was  ignored by the Courts below, but on a different (and in our opinion, an erroneous) interpretation of the same set of facts.  This is not the manner in which revisional powers should be invoked.  In this view of the matter, we are of the considered opinion that the jurisdiction conferred on the National Commission under Section 21 (b) of the Act has been transgressed.  It was not a case where such a view could have been taken by setting aside the concurrent findings of two fora.”
7.       Same principle has been reiterated by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H & R Johnson (India) Ltd. and Ors. (2016 8 SCC 286 wherein Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:-
“23. The  National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in their or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity. In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
8.       The State Commission was perfectly justified in dismissing the Appeal. I see no reason to disagree with the concurrent findings of both the Fora below. There is no infirmity or illegality in the impugned order, warranting interference under Section 21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Revision Petition is therefore dismissed with no order as to costs.

4)         That the SECOND PARTY will adjust these Intending Allottee(s), as mentioned in the “Annexure-C” of this MoU, in case any of these intending Allottee(s) wish to retain/buy plot(s)/unit(s) in the said PROJECT, subject to the condition that their prevailing plot/unit rate(s),  Basic Sale Price (BSP), in the Agreement to Sell with the FIRST PARTY should not be less than Rs. 12,000/- psy (Rupees Twelve Thousand only per sq. yard) and also subject to the availability of plot(s)/unit(s) in the said PROJECT.
6)         That the SECOND PARTY will have the rights to execute a fresh Agreement to Sell & Purchase with these Intending allottee(s) who wish to retain their Unit(s)/Plot(s).  And will receive the balance payment from them, as and when demanded as per their new payment terms and conditions in the Agreement to Sell & Purchase executed with the SECOND PARTY.
9)         That the sale amount received by the FIRST PARTY from those Intending Allottee(s) as mentioned in “Annexure-C” of this MoU, who do not wish to retain their Plots/Units in the said PROJECT, then it will the Sole responsibility of the FIRST PARTY to either refund them or adjust that amount in any of their (FIRST PARTY) other Projects.  Under no circumstances the SECOND PARTY will be responsible for the amount received from those intending Allottee(s), as mentioned in Annexure-C’ of this MoU, who do not wish to retain their Plots/Units in the said PROJECT.”
3.      No fresh agreements were executed by the Complainants with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and no payment was made by them to the afore-said firm.  Since the plots allotted to them by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. were not developed, the Complainants approached the concerned District Forum/State Commission by way of separate complaints.  In two cases the complaints were instituted before the District Forum whereas in one case the complaint was instituted before the State Commission.  The complainants sought refund of the amount which they had paid for the plots along with interest, compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted both by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  and Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  As noted by the State Commission it was stated in the written version filed by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. that no assured allotment had been made by them and the Complainant was only an investor.  The said written version, it is informed, was filed only in Consumer Complaint subject matter of FA No. 760/2016. The complaint was resisted by the petitioner/appellant Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company primarily on the ground that there was no privity of contract between them and the complainants and in terms of the MoU, it was for UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. to refund the amount received from such allottees who did not switch over to them and did not execute agreements with them.
","5.      The consumer complaints having been allowed by the District Forum in Revision Petition No. 495 and 496 of 2017, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The said appeals having been dismissed the aforesaid petitioner is before this Commission by way of Revision Petitions No. 495 and 496 of 2017. The consumer complaint subject matter of FA No. 760 of 2016 having been allowed by the State Commission against the appellant herein namely Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company as well as UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the afore-said firm is before this Commission by way of FA No. 760 of 2016.
6.      It is an admitted position that no payment whatsoever was made by any of these complainants to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  It is also an undisputed position that none of them executed any agreement with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of clause 6 of the MoU.  It is evident from a bare perusal of  clause 4 of the MoU that the Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company was required to adjust the persons to whom allotment was made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. in case any of them wished to retain the plots subject to the condition that the price in that case was not to be less than ₹12,000/- per sq. yd. and such adjustment was to be subject to the availability of the plots/units in the afore-said project.  The total number of the allottees who were to be adjusted by  Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company was not to exceed 75 and for every allottee retaining their plot/unit with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company a sum of  ₹50,000/- was to be paid to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  It is also evident from clause 9 of the MoU that if an allottee did not wish to retain plot/unit in the project with Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company, the refund to such allottee was to be made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. and not by Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company.  It was expressly made clear in clause 9 of the MoU that under no circumstance Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company will be responsible for the amount received from such allottees who did not wish to retain their plots/units in the project.
7.      Even as per annexure B to the MoU, if any allottee to whom allotment was made by UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. wanted to retain his plot/unit, the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. received from such an allottee was to be adjusted in the payment which Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company had to make to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. by 15.084.2017 and in that case, the amount paid by the allottee retaining the plot/unit in the project was to be taken as the payment made by Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.
8.      Since the allottees did not write to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company seeking to retain their allotment on the terms and conditions mentioned in the MoU, it is only UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. which remained liable to make refund of the amount which it had received from them along-with appropriate interest/compensation and no such liability can be imposed upon Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company particularly in view of clause 9 of the MoU executed on 13.01.2015.
9.      The learned Counsel for the Complainant has drawn my attention to clause 15 of the MoU which reads as under:-
“That complete sale process, w.e.f. date of Signing of this MoU by both the Parties, for the Plot(s)/Unit(s) in the said PROJECT including Agreement/Sale documents and payments collection will be executed sole by the SECOND PARTY.  Under no circumstances, the FIRST PARTY will be able to sell and/or execute any documents pertaining to the Sale of the Plot(s)/Unit(s) in the said PROJECT directly to any third party, without the written consent from the SECOND PARTY.”
The aforesaid clause, in my opinion, is wholly irrelevant for the purpose of deciding these matters since the said Clause deals with the completion of the project but obviously would apply only in respect of those allottees who switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of clause 14(I4) of the MoU and not to the allottees  who did not switched over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and the entire payment by whom was made only to UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  In fact, even UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. did not claim in its written version filed before the State Commission that it was the obligation of Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company to refund the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. had received from the Complainants.  In fact, in an affidavit dated 17.084.2015 Mr. Udai Raj Singh Brar, Director of UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. has clearly stated that any amount received by the Company UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. jfrom any party/individual against the booking/sale etc. of any part/unit/plot in the project Capital Greens will be the responsibility of UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. including refund etc., and under no circumstance Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company or its assignees or employees will have any responsibility for the refund of the said amount.
10.    It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the complainants that after executing MoU with UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company did not write any letters to the complainants informing them of the execution of the MoU and giving them an option to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of the MoU executed between the parties.  However, no such obligation on Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company is found in the MoU.  Primarily, it was for UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the said company having collected money from the complainants to inform the allottees of the said MoU and given them an opportunity to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company in terms of the MoU executed between Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  No doubt UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. could not have compelled the allottees to switch over to Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company on the terms and conditions agreed between Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company and UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., but then if such terms and conditions were not acceptable to the allotees, the appropriate course of action for them was to take recourse to legal proceedings against UK Homes Pvt. Ltd., the said company having taken money and having made allotment to them.
11.    For the reasons stated, hereinabove, the impugned orders to the extent Urban Umbrella Development and Management Company has also been directed to refund the amount which UK Homes Pvt. Ltd.  received from the Complainants cannot be sustained and to this extent the impugned order is set aside.  However, the impugned orders to the extent they are directed against UK Homes Pvt. Ltd. and its Directors remained unaltered.  The appeal and the revision petitions stand disposed of accordingly.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
1.     The present First Appeal is preferred under Sec. 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the order dated 11.07.2018 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow (for short “State Commission”).
2.     Brief facts relevant for disposal of the case are that the complainant had taken an electric connection of 130 KVA in the year 2013. The complainant had been regularly paying the bills. It is stated that after a long gap of four years, the OP sent a demand notice vide letter No. 3752 dated 22.12.2017 for Rs. 37,25,673/-, wherein it was mentioned that the previous bills were on the basis of MF- 2 instead of MF – 4 . So, the difference amount as mentioned above was demanded.  Being aggrieved by the act of demanding dues after two years, which was against Sec. 56 (2) of Electricity Act 2003, the complainant filed a complaint in the State Commission.
3.     The State Commission, vide order dated 11.07.2018, dismissed the complaint with the following observation:
In view of averments made in complaint it is apparent that the complainant M/s Sheetla Granite Daharra is firm having partners and the electric connection in question has been obtained by it for commercial purpose to run machine for crushing stones. As such the complainant is not a consumer as defined in Section (2)(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act , 1986 .
In complaint the complainant has simply said that it has started crushing of rocks through the machine for earning its livelihood. It has not been stated in complaint that the business of crushing of rocks through machine has been started for the purpose of earning livelihood by means of self employment. In complaint it has also not been averred that complainant firm and its partners were unemployed and business of firm has been started for self employment. As such the explanation of Section 2(1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 is not applicable on complainant in view of averments made in complaint. The view expressed above finds support from the judgment of Hon’ble National Commission rendered in the case of Shweta Sharma V/s M/s BPTP Limited reported in 2018 (1) CPR 244 (NC).
Learned Counsel for the complainant has referred following case laws.
Kerala State Electricity Board and another V/s Yeshu Adimandar (Died) Thr. Legal Heir – II (2016) CPJ 238 (NC).
Sri Venkateswara Syndicate V/s Oriental Insurance Company Limited and another – II(2010) CPJ I (SC) .
In view of discussion made above case laws referred by learned Counsel for the complainant are not applicable on facts of present case.
In view of conclusion drawn above complainant firm is not a consumer as defined in Section 2(1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and the complaint filed by it is not maintainable under the Act. As such complaint is dismissed with liberty to the complainant to approach competent court according to law.
(extract from the State Commission’s Order)
4.     Being aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the complainant has filed the present First Appeal.
5.     We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant and perused the material on record.
6.     Multiplication factor of energy meters is a very important ingredient in the calculation of actual energy consumed. The OP had mistakenly calculated the bill on the basis of MF-2 when it was to be calculated on the basis of MF-4. So, the OP is entitled to the remaining amount. Moreover, it is seen that the complainant is not a consumer. The complainant, being a firm having partners and doing the job of crushing of rocks through a machine cannot be taken to be self- employed and doing it for livelihood. The Consumer Protect Act , 1986 specifically only excludes persons who buy goods exclusively for the purpose of earning their livelihood , by means of self- employment. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Paramount Digital Colour Lab v. Agfa India Private Limited, as reported in  III (2018) CPJ 12 (SC) held that the Court has to look at the dominant purpose for which the purchase is made in order to decide whether it was for a ‘commercial purpose’.  In the present matter, electricity was taken from the OP to run the machine for crushing the rocks. The firm was run to procure profit. This prima facie shows that the complainant was undertaking a commercial activity.
","7.     On the basis of the foregoing discussion, we hold that the complainant is not a ‘consumer’ as per the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Therefore, the present appeal is dismissed.
Per Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh, Member
8.     The complainant firm, M/s Sheetla Granite Daharra, is in the business of crushing rocks through machinery. The State Commission, vide its impugned Order dated 11.07.2018, had dismissed its complaint, filed against an electricity distribution co., holding that it was not a ‘consumer’ under the Act 1986.
9.     Here we may refer to section 2 (1) (d) (i) & (ii) of the Act 1986:
Section 2 (1) (d) (i) & (ii):
“consumer” means any person who,–
(i)      buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such use is made with the approval of such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii)      hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person who avails of such services for any commercial purpose.
Explanation.- For the purposes of this clause, “commercial purpose” does not include use by a person of goods bought and used by him and services availed by him exclusively for the purposes of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment.
10.   Section 2 (1) (d) (i) & (ii) specifically stipulate “but does not include a person who obtain such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose” and “but does not include a person who avails of such services for any commercial purpose”.
The Explanation to section 2 (1) (d) stipulates that “ “commercial purpose” does not include use by a person of goods bought and used by him and services availed by him exclusively for the purposes of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment.”
11.   The Explanation to section 2 (1) (d) is clear. “exclusively for the purposes of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment” in the Explanation has to be adjudged rationally and logically with the due understanding and significance of “exclusively” and “livelihood” and “self-employment”. Reasonable and logical interpretation has to be kept limited and confined to reason and logic, not hypothised towards anyhow allowing anyone in.
12.   A bland averment in the complaint, loosely articulated in the language of the Explanation to section 2 (1) (d), as has been made by the complainant firm in the instant case, is not sufficient to hold a person as ‘consumer’, when the facts speak otherwise. The averment has to be clear and categorical, and, in a case of the present specificities, has to be established through facts, which onus the complainant firm has failed to discharge.
13.   The State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order, and rightly determined that the complainant firm is not a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of section (2) (1) (d) of the Act 1986.
14.   We also make it clear, in the present context, that section 2 (1) (d) (meaning of ‘consumer’) and section 3 (additional remedy to consumers) have to be understood in conjunction and perspective. It has to be noted that denial to avail additional remedy in consumer protection fora to a person who is not a ‘consumer’ does not take away or affect his right to agitate his case in an appropriate forum / court as per the law. Conversely, the availability of additional remedy in consumer protection fora does not take away the option of a ‘consumer’ to agitate his case in any other appropriate forum / court.
15.   We explicitly clarify that we have not gone into the merits of the dispute between the opposing sides. The complainant firm is, thus, free to agitate its case in any appropriate forum / court as per the law (but consumer protection fora established under the Act 1986 are not for it).
16.   With this brief examination, and with observations as in paras 14 and 15 above, the appeal is dismissed.

  For the Appellant     :MR. ARVIND GARG 
  For the Respondent      :
","(ORAL)
The present appeal has been filed on 17.02.2020 challenging the order of the State Commission dated 28.12.2018 whereby the complaint of the respondent was allowed ex parte.  Since the present appeal is delayed by about 355 days, an application IA No. 2459 of 2020 seeking condonation of delay has also been filed alongwith present appeal.  Arguments on the application are heard.
IA No. 2459 of 2020 ( condonation of delay)
1.         It is argued by counsel that free copy of the impugned order was received by the appellant on 28.01.2019 and, thereafter, file alongwith supporting documents were handed over to the counsel Mohd. Shami  Ahmad at Lucknow.  He unfortunately died on 01.02.2019 but the appellant was not aware of this fact and learnt of it only on 07.01.2020. Thereafter, it applied for the certified copy of judgment and other documents, which were issued on 15.01.2020 and then  the
-2-
present appeal has been filed. It is submitted that delay had occurred due to these reasons and which were beyond the control of the appellant.
2.         I have heard the learned counsel and perused the file. As per the appellant, he had received the free copy of the ex parte judgment on 28.01.2019 and it is submitted that judgment alongwith supporting documents was handed over to advocate Mohd. Shami Ahmad.  This contention does not inspire any confidence. As per law, what the appellant would have received is free copy of ex parte judgment and not supporting documents. Admittedly while fulfilling the statutory requirement of sending free copy of the judgment, the Commissions do not send the documents and the evidences which form part of their record.  In view of this, the contention that supporting documents alongwith copy of judgment was handed over to advocate does not inspire any confidence and it seems to be false plea. Moreover, from the contention, it is apparent that till 07.01.2020, the appellant did not make any effort to find out as to whether the appeal had been filed by advocate Mohd. Shami Ahmad or not. As per the appellant, he learnt of his death which happened on 01.02.2019 only on 07.01.2020. This shows that almost for 11 months, the appellant did  not make any effort to know the status of filing of his appeal. In light of these facts, can it be said that conduct of the petitioner was such which is sufficient for condonation of delay.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in catena of judgments has held that condonation of delay is not a matter of right and sufficient causes are required to be shown and where sufficient causes are not shown, the Courts have no discretion but to dismiss the application.  It  has been so held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Ram Lal and Ors. Vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited AIR 1962 SC 361” as under:
-3-
“12. It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not
entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
3.         In the case of “R.B.Ramlingam Vs. R.B.Bhavaneshwari I (2009) CLT 188 SC”, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held that Courts are required to see whether the person had acted with reasonable diligence and where it is found missing, he fails the test.  The Apex Court has held as  under:
""5. We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
4.         The Hon’ble Supreme Court has again cautioned this Commission that while dealing with the application under section 5 of the Limitation Act, the special nature of Act has to be kept in mind.  The Hon’ble Court in “Anshul Aggarwal Vs. New Okha Industrial Development Authority (2011) 14 SCC 578”has held as under:
“5.          It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special
-4-
period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and
revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Fora.""
5.         From the above facts, it is clear that appellant had not acted with reasonable  diligence. They had a nap of about 11 months after handing over the file to advocate.  They  have failed to show the reasonable grounds which prevented them from coming to the Court for filing the present appeal within the period of limitation. Delay of 355 days is a huge delay.  Valuable right has accrued to the respondent / complainant.
","6.         For the aforegoing reasons, I found no ground to condone the delay.  Application is dismissed.
FIRST APPEAL
Consequently, thereupon, since the application for condonation of delay has been dismissed, the First Appeal is also dismissed as barred by limitation.

  For the Respondent      :For the Respondent:  
In FA/531/2019        :  Mr. Vijay Gupta, in person 
","These first appeals have been filed by the appellant Sahara Prime City Ltd. & ors against the order dated 16.10.2018, 06.12.2018, 11.10.2018 & 15.01.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Rajasthan (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Complaint No.86/2017, 119/2017, 128/2017 & 15/2018.  As the facts of these cases are similar and same issues are involved in these appeals, they are being decided together.  First Appeal No.531 of 2019, Sahara Prime City Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Vijay Gupta shall be taken as lead case.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that on 15.03.2005, the respondent applied for the booking of a unit in the project “Sahara City Homes, Jaipur”, of the appellants by transfer of a booking that had been previously made in the name of the respondent’s father. On 06.06.2008, the appellants approved the transfer of the unit booked by the respondent’s father in the name of the respondent. On 12.03.2005, booking amount of Rs.1,35,350/- was paid by the respondent to the appellants with respect to the said unit.  On 21.08.2009, the appellants issued the allotment letter confirming the booking of the unit No.C3/605 in Sahara City Homes, Jaipur in favour of the respondent for the total sale consideration of Rs.27,07,000/-.  It was stated in the allotment letter that in case of delay of payment of installments by the respondent, the respondent would be charged 15% p.a. interest on the said installment amount from the date on which such payment was due.  On 07.09.2009, the respondent requested the appellants  regarding the change of his payment plan to that of construction linked plan. The complainant has paid a total amount of Rs.24,80,375/-. As possession was not delivered, the consumer complaint No.86 of 2017 was filed by the respondent contending that possession of the flat was not handed over to the respondent within stipulated time, there is deficiency of service on the part of the appellants and a sum of Rs.24,80,375/- was prayed for refund along with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. along with the compensation for the mental, physical harassment amounting to Rs.20,00,000/-, Rs.2,00,000/- for cost of the proceedings, bank charges amounting to Rs.8,00,000/-, rent expenses amounting to Rs.20,00,000/- and for the delay in possession amounting to Rs.2,61,945/-.  The appellant filed their written statement before the State Commission contending that complaint of the respondent is baseless since the contract between the appellants and the respondent was only for the purchase of a unit/flat and not for the construction of the same by the site owner with a contractor.  The State Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because matter was to be referred to arbitration in case of any dispute.  Further, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the contempt petition bearing No.412 of 2012 in the civil appeal 9813 of 2011 titled as SEBI Vs. Sahara Real Estate Corporation Ltd. imposed ban on the appellants to part with any of the immovable properties.  However, the State Commission passed the following order:-
“In view of the above, the complaint is allowed and the complainant is entitled to get Rs.24,80,375/- along with 15% interest from the date of each deposit.  The complainant is further entitled to get Rs.2 lakhs as compensation for mental agony and Rs.50,000/- as cost of proceedings which should be paid to the complainant within one month otherwise it will carry 9% interest from the date of the order.”
3.      Hence the present appeal.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the appellants as well as respondent in person in FA/531/2019 & 532/2019 and the learned counsel for the respondent in 534/2019 and none appeared in FA/533/2019 even after service of notice, hence, hearing from respondent Surendra Singh has been dispensed with as the appeals are on similar grounds and the defence of the respondents is also similar.
5.      Learned counsel for the appellants stated that the State Commission has ordered refund of the deposited amount by the respondents/complainants along with 15% p.a. interest from the date of respective deposits till actual payment.  Apart from this, the State Commission has also awarded a compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- in each case for mental agony and Rs.50,000/- as cost of litigation in each case.  Learned counsel contended that the amount deposited by the complainants has been utilized in the construction and the amount deposited by the complainants did not earn any interest, therefore, the same should not have been ordered to be refunded along with interest.  Moreover, the rate of interest awarded by the State Commission is very high.  These days, this Commission as well as Hon’ble Supreme Court are ordering refund along with 9% p.a. interest and therefore, there was no justification for the State Commission to have ordered refund along with 15% p.a. interest.
6.      The learned counsel for the appellants further argued that the State Commission has also awarded a compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- in each case for mental agony, whereas, the same is not justified when the interest is being awarded on the amount of refund.  This is an accepted principle of law that if the interest is being awarded, then separate compensation is not justified as interest is also in the form of compensation.  The learned counsel also requested to condone the delay in filing the present appeals as the delay has happened on account of getting orders from the head office, in arranging a counsel at New Delhi and in getting the translation of all the documents as all documents were in Hindi.  The delay is not intentional.
7.      On the other hand, respondents/complainants in First Appeal No.531 of 2019 & 532 of 2019 stated that the appellant has charged interest @15% p.a. on the amount of instalment if paid with delay.  On the principle of parity, they stated that the deposited amount by the complainants with the builder should also be refunded along with 15% p.a. interest.  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent/complainant in First Appeal No.534/2019 also agreed with the arguments advanced by the respondents/complainants in First Appeal No.531/2019 & 532/2019.  The leaned counsel further stated that the reasons given in the application for condonation of delay in filing the present appeals are only administrative in nature which cannot be considered as sufficient cause for condoning the delay.  Hence the appeals deserve to be dismissed only on the ground of limitation.
8.      In respect of compensation of Rs.2,00,000/-, the respondents/complainants stated that the compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- has been awarded for mental agony that has been suffered by the complainants.  Moreover, this Commission has taken a view that if 18% p.a. interest is awarded then no other compensation is required to be given.  In the present case, only 15% p.a. interest has been awarded and therefore, the complainants are entitled to separate compensation for mental agony and harassment.
9.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the sides and have examined the record.  First of all, it is seen that there is delay in filing these appeals.  The main reasons for delay appear to be time taken in getting all the documents translated from Hindi to English, time taken in arranging a counsel at New Delhi and time taken in getting the approvals from the head office of the company.  These reasons seem to be genuine and by delaying the appeals, the appellant is not expected to be benefited.  Hon’ble Supreme Court in Manoharan Vs. Sivarajan & Ors, Civil Appeal No.10581 of 2013, decided on 25.11.2013 (SC) has observed the following:-
“9. In the case of State of Bihar & Ors. v. Kameshwar Prasad Singh & Anr., it was held that power to condone the delay in approaching the Court has been conferred upon the Courts to enable them to do substantial justice to parties by disposing the cases on merit. The relevant paragraphs of the case read as under:
“11. Power to condone the delay in approaching the Court has been conferred upon the Courts to enable    them to do substantial justice to parties by disposing of matters on merits. This Court in Collector, Land Acquisition, Anantnag v. Mst. Katiji (1987)ILLJ 500 SC held that the expression 'sufficient cause' employed by the legislature in the Limitation Act is adequately elastic to enable the Courts to apply the law in a meaningful manner which subserves the ends of justice-that being the life purpose for the existence of the institution of Courts. It was further observed that a liberal approach is adopted on principle as it is realised that:
1. Ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by lodging an appeal late.
2. Refusing to condone delay can result in a meritorious matter being thrown out at the very threshold and cause of justice being defeated. As against this when delay is condoned the highest that can happen is that a cause would be decided on merits after hearing the parties.
3. 'Every day's delay must be explained' does not mean that a pedantic approach should be made. Why not every hour's delay, every second's delay? The doctrine must be applied in a rational common sense pragmatic manner.
4. When substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against each other, cause of substantial justice deserves to be preferred for the other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because of a non-deliberate delay.
5. There is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately, or  on  account  of  culpable  negligence,  or  on account of mala fides. A litigant does not stand to benefit by resorting to delay. In fact he runs a serious risk.
6. It must be grasped that judiciary is respected not on account of its power to legalize injustice on technical grounds but because it is capable of removing injustice and is expected to do so.”
","10.    Relying on the above judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and on the grounds mentioned in the application for condonation of delay, I deem it appropriate to condone the delay in each appeal at a cost of Rs.50,000/- to be paid to the complainant in each case. The main issue relates to award of interest on the amount of refund by the State Commission against which the present appeals have been filed.  The complainants are trying to defend the award of 15% p.a. interest on the ground that the appellant is charging 15% p.a. interest on the amount of instalment, if delayed and on the principle of parity, the complainants should also be allowed interest @15% p.a.  On the other hand, the appellants have stated that presently this Commission and Hon’ble Supreme Court are awarding interest @9% p.a. on amount of refund.  The provision in respect of levying 15% p.a. interest on the delayed instalments is present in the agreement which has been signed by both the sides, whereas, there is no such agreement between the parties for payment of 15% p.a. interest, if the amount is to be refunded to the complainants in any eventuality. Clearly a builder utilizes the amount paid by the allottees in the project and generally the amount is not available for earning any interest for a long time.  However, as the amount remained with the builder and the amount has been ordered to be refunded, the builder is responsible to pay interest as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Alok Shanker Pandey Vs. Union of India &Ors., II (2007) CPJ 3 (SC) as under:-
“9.  It may be mentioned that there is misconception about interest.  Interest is not a penalty or punishment at all, but it is the normal accretion on capital.  For example if A had to pay B a certain amount, say 10 years ago, but he offers that amount to him today, then he has pocketed the interest on the principal amount.  Had A paid that amount to B 10 years ago, B would have invested that amount somewhere and earned interest thereon, but instead of that A has kept that amount with himself and earned interest on it for this period.  Hence equity demands that A should not only pay back the principal amount but also the interest thereon to B.”
11.   When there is no contract between the parties for paying interest on the amount of refund, it is the discretion of the consumer forum to award reasonable interest in the matter.  Clearly, the interest cannot be awarded on the basis of parity in such cases where there is no agreement for providing such an interest on the amount of refund.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kolkata West International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Deva Asis Rudra, II (2019) CPJ 29 (SC) has reduced the rate of interest on the amount of refund from 12% per annum as awarded by this Commission to 9% per annum.  Accordingly, I deem it appropriate to allow refund with 10% interest per annum in the facts and circumstances of the cases.
12.    When the interest rate has been ordered to be changed from 15% p.a. to 10% p.a., I do not find justification for setting aside the order of the State Commission in respect of the compensation of Rs.2,00,000/-.
13.    Based on the above discussion, these appeals no.531 of 2019, 532 of 2019, 533 of 2019 and 534 of 2019 are partly allowed and the orders of the State Commission passed in four complaints are modified to the extent that the appellants shall refund the amounts mentioned in the orders of the State Commission in each case along with 10% p.a. interest instead of 15% p.a. interest as ordered by the State Commission.  With this modification, the orders of the State Commission passed in Complaint cases No.86 of 2017, 119 of 2017, 128 of 2017 and 15 of 2018 are upheld.  The appellant shall also pay Rs.50,000/- (fifty thousand only) as cost for condoning the delay to the complainant in each case. The orders be complied with by the appellants within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.

  For the Respondent      :Ms. Ankita Chaudhary Rathi, Advocate
Mr. Gopal Shastri, Advocate
Ms. Archana Pathak Dave, Advocate 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent obtained a personal accident insurance policy from the petitioner HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd., for the period from 23.12.2015 to 22.12.2016.  Under the policy, a total sum insured of Rs.10 lac was payable to the complainant/respondent interalia in case of permanent total disability.  However, 50% of the sum assured was payable to him in case of total permanent loss of one limb.  Condition no.2 of the general conditions of the policy stipulated with the policy would be voidable in case of any misrepresentation, mis-description or non-disclosure on the part of the insured in respect of any material particular.
2.      The case of the complainant/respondent is that on 08.02.2016, he met with a road accident at Alwar Road, Rajgarh when he was hit by a car.  The complainant was admitted in Dhanwantri Hospital & Research Centre, Jaipur on the same day and was discharged on 12.02.2016.  His right leg had to be amputated and as per the certificate issued by the hospital, he suffered disability to the extent of 65%.  The compensation, in terms of the insurance policy taken by the complainant, having not been paid, he approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the insurer which inter-alia stated in its written version that the documents sought by them had not been provided by the insured.
4.      The District Forum, vide its order dated 14.06.2016, directed the insurer to decide the claim within two months and also pay Rs.10,000/- as compensation to the complainant alongwith cost of litigation quantified at Rs.5,000/-.
5.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  Vide impugned order dated 25.10.2018, the State Commission directed the insurer to pay a sum of Rs.10 lacs to the complainant alongwith 9% interest from the date of the accident and cost of proceedings quantified at Rs.30,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the petitioner insurer is before this Commission.
6.      The main submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the injury which led to amputation of his right leg was suffered by the complainant prior to taking the insurance cover with effect from 23.12.2015 and therefore, not only a misrepresentation was made by him while lodging the claim, even the injury suffered by him was not covered under the insurance policy taken by him.
7.      A perusal of the record of the Dhanwantri Hospital & Research Centre, Jaipur would show that the complainant Mr. Ramesh Chand Saini was admitted in the said hospital on 08.02.2016 and at the time of admission, he had given history of a road accident at about 11:30 am on 08.02.2016.  It was stated by him that he was hit by a moving car.  The FIR at the concerned Police Station was lodged by the nephew of the complainant who inter-alia stated in the said FIR that at about 11:30 am on 08.02.2016, when he, alongwith the complainant, was standing at Old Octroi Alwar Road, waiting for a bus, driver of car number RJ-14CC-9037 hit on the right leg of the complainant.  He however, stated that the complainant was moved to a hospital but considering the injury, he was referred to Jaipur.  The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that on enquiry at Government CHC, Rajgarh, the investigator appointed by the insurer was informed that the complainant had not been brought to the said hospital on 08.02.2016.  This according to the learned counsel, shows that the version given in the FIR was incorrect.  The contention, in my view, is mis-conceived.  Nowhere in the FIR, the nephew of the complainant claimed that they had first gone to Government CHC at Rajgarh.  The name of the hospital where they had first gone, was not given in the FIR.  The investigator appointed by the insurer did not record the statement of the nephew of the complainant or of the complainant to find out as to which hospital at Rajgarh they had visited before going to Dhanwantri Hospital & Research Centre, Jaipur.  The FIR clearly indicates that no treatment was given to the complainant in the hospital where they had initially gone at Government CHC, Rajgarh.  Therefore, the omission of name of the hospital at Rajgarh in the FIR would be inconsequential.
8.      The driver of the offending vehicle was examined by the investigator and in his statement recorded by the investigator, he maintained that the accident involving the car driven by him, had taken place in January/February when he was going to Jaipur from Alwar via Rajgarh.  Though he blamed the complainant for the accident by claiming that the complainant was crossing the road at a high speed, this was only to be expected since the driver would not admit rash and negligent driving on his part.  Though the time of the accident given by him was 2-3 pm, discrepancy in time would be inconsequential, considering that the statement of the driver was recorded quite some time after the accident.  What is material is that the driver affirmed the accident at Alwar Road, Rajgarh, from the vehicle was being driven by him.  Therefore, the statement of the driver broadly supports the case set up by the complainant.
9.      Though the case of the insurer seems to be that the complainant had got injured before taking the insurance cover effective from 23.12.2015, no evidence was collected by the investigator to show that the complainant had actually suffered injury prior to 23.12.2015.  If he had suffered injury prior to 23.12.2015, he must have taken treatment somewhere before he was admitted in Dhanwantri Hospital & Research Centre, Jaipur on 08.02.2016.  No record of the treatment of the complainant at any hospital anywhere before 08.02.2016 has been found by the investigator.  Therefore, I see no reason to disbelieve the case set out by the complainant when the said case found ample corroboration not only from the history given at the time of treatment in Dhanwantri Hospital & Research Centre, Jaipur but also from the statement of the driver recorded by none other than the investigator appointed by the insurer.  Therefore, I find no ground to interfere with the finding returned by the State Commission as regards the injury to the complainant.
10.    It is next submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the injury suffered by the complainant was only to the extent of causing 65% disability, only 50% of the sum insured was payable to him.  11.  The question as to what constitutes a total permanent disability came up for consideration of this Commission in RP No.2003 of 2018 Life Insurance Corporation of India & Anr. Vs. Mahaveer Prasad Regar decided on 02.08.2018 and the following view was taken:
In Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Suresh Chand Yadav & Ors., I (2017) CPJ 424 (NC), the complainant/ respondent was the beneficiary of a Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme taken by his employer.  The said policy provided for payment of compensation in the event of permanent total disablement of the insured for a period of 12 consecutive months.  The total and permanent disablement was defined in the policy to mean that the insured was unable to engage in each and every occupation or employment for compensation or profit, for which he was reasonably qualified by education, training or experience.  The policy also provided for payment of compensation in a case of permanent partial disablement, but the benefit payable in that case was only 50%. The bus, which the complainant / respondent was driving, he being a driver with RSRTC, met with an accident.  The complainant got seriously injured in the said accident and his one leg had to be amputated.  He lodged a claim for payment of Rs.2.00 lacs, alleging permanent disablement.
The complaint filed by the complainant in the above referred matter, having been allowed by the fora below, the insurer approached this Commission contending that the amputation of only one leg had not resulted in permanent disablement of the complainant.  Dismissing the revision petition, this Commission inter-alia observed and held as under:
“5.      Section 2(1)(l) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 defines total disablement to mean such disablement whether of a temporary or permanent nature, as incapacitates the workman for all work which he was capable of performing, at the time of accident resulting in such disablement.  The aforesaid provision came up for consideration of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pratap Narain Singh Deo Vs. Srinivas Sabata & Anr. (1976) 1 SCC 289.  In that case the employee, who was a carpenter had lost is left hand above the elbow and therefore had become unfit for the work of carpenter.  It was held by the Commissioner, he having been rendered unfit of a work of carpentry which could not be done by one hand alone had suffered total disablement.  The findings recorded by the Commissioner were accepted by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  Thus despite use of the words ‘which he was capable of performing at the time of the accident’ the test applied was whether he could despite the injury, continue to be engaged in the work which he was performing at the time of the accident.
6.     In K. Janardhan Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd. & Anr. (2008) 8 SCC 518, the right leg of the work has to be amputated above the knee.  The question which came up for consideration of the Supreme Court was as to whether he had suffered a 100% disability.  Referring to its earlier decision in Pratap Narain Singh Deo (supra) it was held that he had suffered a 100% disability and incapacity in earning his keep as a tanker driver.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court rejected the contention of the insurance company that amputation amounted to 60% reduction in earning capacity since the doctor had opined disability upto 65%.
7.     In Mohan Soni Vs. Ram Avtar Tomar & Ors. (2012) 2 SCC 267, the appellant who use to earn his livelihood as a cart puller met with an accident as a result of which his left leg had to be amputated below the know.  He filed an application before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, claiming compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.  In the identity card given to the appellant his disability was shown as 60%.  The Tribunal held that his disability could not be above 50% and fixed compensation accordingly.  Being aggrieved he approached the High Court by way of an appeal.  The compensation was enhanced by the High Court.  Being still dissatisfied, he approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of a Special Leave.  Allowing the appeal, Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia observed and held as under:
“8.    …… In the context of loss of future earning, any physical disability resulting from an accident has to be judged with reference to the nature of work being performed by the person suffering the disability.  This is the basic premise and once that is grasped, it clearly follows that the same injury or loss may affect two different persons in different ways.  Take the case of a marginal farmer who does his cultivation work himself and ploughs his land with his own two hands; or the puller of a cycle-rickshaw, one of the main means of transport in hundreds of small towns all over the country.  The loss of one of the legs either to the marginal farmer or the cycle-rickshaw-puller would be the end of the road insofar as their earning capacity is concerned.  But in case of a person engaged in some kind of desk work in an office, the loss of a leg may not have the same effect.  The loss of a leg (or for that matter the loss of any limb) to anyone is bound to have very traumatic effect on one’s personal, family or social life but the loss of one of the legs to a person working in the office would not interfere with his work/earning capacity in the same degree as in the case of a marginal farmer or a cycle-rickshaw-puller”.
“13.  Any scaling down of the compensation should require something more tangible than a hypothetical conjecture that notwithstanding the disability, the victim could make up for the loss of income b changing his vocation or aby adopting another means of livelihood.  The party advocating for a lower amount of compensation for that reason must plead and show before the Tribunal that the victim enjoyed some legal protection (as in the case of persons covered by the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995) or in case of the vast multitude who earn their livelihood in the unorganized sector of leading cogent evidence that the victim had in fact changed his vocation or the means of his livelihood and by virtue of such change he was deriving a certain income”.
8.      In Jakir Hussein Vs. Sabir & Ors. (2015) 7 SCC 252, the appellant before the Hon’ble Supreme Court who at the relevant time was working as a driver, was driving the tempo which met with an accident, causing grievous injuries to him.  He sustained grievous and compound fractures in his right arm, preventing him from performing his regular work as a driver.  He preferred a claim under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988.  Being dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded to him by the Tribunal and the High Court, he approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of an appeal and contended that he being a driver it was a case of the permanent disablement, though, the doctor had assessed his permanent disability at 55%.  Relying upon its earlier decision, in Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar (2011) 1 SCC 343, where the Hon’ble Supreme Court had given illustration of a driver who had permanent disablement of hand and had held that the loss of future earning capacity in such a case would be virtually hundred percent, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the disablement in the case of the appellant before it, may be treated as hundred percent loss, since he will never be able to work again as a driver.  The contention of the insurer that the appellant could take up another alternative employment was rejected by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  The aforesaid judgment squarely applies to this case, since the respondent / complainant being a driver, will never be able to drive the vehicles of his employer or any other vehicle.  The disability of the respondent / complainant therefore, would be permanent and hundred percent.  This is more so when there is no evidence to prove that the respondent / complainant is qualified by education, training or experience to obtain another employment where duties of the office can be performed without use of both the feet.”
12.    The complainant in this matter was working at a stone crusher lifting the stones used in the crusher.  His right leg has got amputated below the knee.  Therefore, it is not possible for him to continue as a worker at the stone crusher, since a person with only one leg cannot lift and carry stones at a stone crusher.  The complainant thus became incapable of adequately and fully performing the work which he was doing at the time of the accident.  The disability of the complainant on account of amputation of his right leg would result in total permanent disability since he was employed at a stone crusher and his disability would be 100%.  There is no evidence to prove that the complainant would get an alternative and adequate employment despite the permanent total disability in the form of amputation of his right leg.  There is no evidence of the complainant being qualified enough to obtain an alternative and suitable employment despite amputation of his right leg.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the complainant had suffered total permanent disability and therefore, he was entitled to 100% of the sum insured.
","13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the order of the State Commission to the extent the insurer was directed to pay a sum of Rs.10 lacs to the complainant cannot be faulted with.  However, interest to the complainant, in my opinion, should be given to the complainant from the date of institution of the complainant and not from the date of the accident.  The order passed by the State Commission is therefore, modified to this extent.  However, he shall be entitled to the cost of litigation awarded by the State Commission.  The Revision Petition stands disposed of.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The appellant/complainant which is a company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act  had taken cash credit facility from the respondent State Bank of India. The grievance of the appellant/complainant is that though the CC  Account was closed by it on 1.10.2011, a sum of Rs.3 crore was being shown as outstanding against the complainant/appellant in CIBIL as a result of which, the complainant/appellant was not able to get cash credit facility from other financial instructions etc. This is also the case of the appellant/complainant that on account of the aforesaid outstanding shown against the complainant, it was not able to submit government tenders. Alleging deficiency on the part of the respondent bank in rendering services to it, the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking the following directions:-
“to return the original documents, such as Original PAN
card of the Company; Original Incorporation certificate
	of the Company and Sale Deeds for 4.25 AC of land of
	Sulthanpur village;
to grant an amount of Rs.90,00,000/- towards
compensation and damages to the complainant for
	mental agony, pain, suffering and inconvenience
	caused by the opposite party by showing false remark
	in CIBIL stating that an amount of Rs.3,23,02,618/- is
	due to the opposite party which ultimately disqualifies
	the complainant from getting future CC account from
	other financial Banks which tantamount to deficiency
	of services and unfair trade practices”
2.      The complaint was resisted by the respondent bank.
3.      The State Commission vide impugned order dated 22.4.2015  dismissed the consumer complaint. Being aggrieved, the appellant/complainant is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
3.       The term ‘consumer’ has been defined in Section 2(1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, which to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of this petition means a person who buys goods or hires or avails services for consideration but does not include a person who obtains goods for resale or who purchases goods or avails services for any commercial purpose.  As per the explanation, inserted with effect from 15.3.2003, for the purpose of the above referred clause, commercial purpose does not include use of the goods or services exclusively for the purpose of the earning livelihood by means of self-employment.
4.      The issue involved in this complaint came to be considered by this Commission in F.A. No.1264 of 2018 -  West Fort Hi-Tech Hospital Limited –Vs- Punjab National Bank decided on 7.1.2020  and the following view was taken:
‘The term ‘Consumer’ used in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act came up for consideration of this Commission in Revision Petition No.2833 of 2018 decided on 06.01.2020 and after considering several decisions on the issue, including Synco Textiles Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Greaves Cotton & Company Ltd. I (1991) CPJ, 499 (NC), Cheema Engineering Services Vs. Rajan Singh (1997) 1 SCC 131, Madan Kumar Singh (Dead) through L.R. Vs. District Magistrate, Sultanpur & Ors. (2009) 9 SCC 79 and Paramount Digital Colour Lab & Ors. Vs. Agfa India Private Limited & Ors. (2018) 14 SCC 81, the larger Bench inter-alia held as under:
(a)     Only a person engaged in large scale commercial activities for the purpose of making profit is not a consumer;
(b)     There should be a direct nexus between the large scale commercial activities in which a person is engaged and the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by him, before he can be excluded from the purview of the term ‘consumer’.  Therefore any goods purchased or the services hired or availed even by a person carrying on business activities on a large scale for the purpose of making profit will not take him out of the definition of the term ‘consumer’, if the transaction of purchases of goods or hiring or availing of services is not intended to generate profit through the large scale commercial activity undertaken by him and does not contribute to or form an essential part of his large scale commercial activities.
(c)     What is crucial for the purpose of determining whether a person is a ‘consumer’ or not is the purpose for which the goods were purchased or the services were hired or availed and not the scale of his commercial activities.
5.       The question as to whether a company taking credit facility from a bank can be said to be a  consumer within the meaning of the C.P. Act has come up for consideration of this Commission in several decisions including Revision Petition No.1750 of 2017 – Union Bank of India & Anr. Vs. M/s Learning Spiral Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., decided on 30.7.2018 and the following was the view taken by this Commission:-
“If the business activities of a company cannot be conveniently undertaken without the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by a company, such purchase or hiring/availing as the case may be, would be for a commercial purpose, because the objective behind such purchase of goods or hiring or availing of the services would be to enable the company to earn profits by undertaking and advancing its business activities.”
","6.       In Subhash Motilal Shah & Ors. Vs. Malegaon Merchants Co.-op Bank Ltd., R.P.No.2571 of 2012 decided on 12-02-2013,  the petitioner which had a current account with the bank  had alleged deficiency in service on the part of the bank. The State Commission dismissed the complaint, holding inter alia as under:
""Admittedly, since Rainbow Corporation is a firm of Ajay Subhash Shah (HUF), i.e., juristic person, there arise no question of self-employment so as to cover the case under explanation to section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 ('Act' for brevity). It is a case relating to an action related with services given while operating the Current Account of Appellant Rainbow Corporation which was admittedly opened and used for business purpose, of the business of 'commission agent' and business of 'yarn sale'. Therefore, since the account itself is connected and related to the business transactions and such banking activity is required for the functioning of a given business enterprise of the appellant/complainant, services hired for that purpose would fall within the category of hiring services for commercial purpose. A useful reference can be made to free dictionary by FARLEX (on Internet) which defines the 'Business Activity' as the activity undertaken as a part of commercial enterprise.  Further, reference can be made to an article available on the internet Website Wise Geek (copyright protected 2003-12 by Conjecture Corporation) and which is written by Alexis. W, edited by Heater Bailey.  Under the circumstances, prima facie appellant/complainant Rainbow Corporation cannot be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d)(ii) of the Act"".
Being aggrieved from the order of the State Commission, the complainant in the said case approached this Commission by way of a revision petition and it was contended by the complainant that considering the aims and objectives behind enactment of the Act, the expression 'consumer' and 'service' as defined under the Act should be construed in a comprehensive manner so as to include the services of commercial and trade oriented nature. In other words, the contention was that any person who hires services for consideration shall be deemed to be a consumer, even if the services were obtained in connection with a commercial activity. However, relying upon the amendment made in the Act with effect from 15-03-2003 the revision petition was dismissed by this Commission thereby upholding the view taken by the State Commission.
7.    In M/s. Sam Fine O Chem Limited Vs. Union Bank of India, C.C.No.39 of 2013, decided on 12-04-2013, the complainant had availed credit facility from Union Bank of India. Alleging deficiency in the services provided by the bank he preferred a complaint before this Commission. Rejecting the complaint this Commission inter alia noted that the complainant had availed the credit facility service of the bank for expansion of its manufacturing activity which was a commercial purpose and, therefore, the complainant did not fall within the definition of 'consumer' given in Section 2(1) (d) of the Act.
8.      In CC No.11 of 2007, Samkit Art & Craft Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State Bank of India & Ors., decided on 14-10-2014, the complainant which was engaged in the business of export had obtained cash credit limit and term loan facility from the State Bank of India. He filed a complaint alleging deficiency on the part of the bank in the services rendered to him. It was held by this Commission that obtaining cash credit facility for the purpose of export of goods was a commercial purpose and, therefore, the complainant company was not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
9.      The complainant being a private company even the benefit of the explanation below Section 2(1)(d) of the C.P. Act is not available to it though even otherwise this benefit of the said provision has not been claimed by it in the consumer complaint. The credit facilities from the said bank were availed by the complainant company for the purpose of its business activities. Therefore, if the complainant/appellant is aggrieved on account of deficiency on the part of the respondent bank in rendering services to it, a Consumer Forum is not  the appropriate Forum for redressal of its grievances. The consumer complaint, therefore, is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.
10.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no justification to interfere with the impugned order. It is, however, made clear that since the complainant is not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the C.P. Act, the dismissal of the consumer complaint shall not come in the way of the complainant/appellant availing such remedy other than a consumer complaint as may be available to it in law.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. Bharat Arora, Advocate
Mr. Gourav Arora, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","The complainant/appellant booked a residential flat with the respondent in a project namely ‘Ekaantam’ which the respondent was developing in Sector-112/113 of Gurgaon.  The sale consideration of the flat, as per the averment made in the appeal, was Rs.2-2.5 Crores.  The complainant/appellant made an initial payment of Rs.15 lacs to the respondent. No further payment was made.  The complainant/appellant, approached the concerned State Commission by way of a Consumer Complaint which was contested by the respondent which also annexed a cheque of Rs.15 lacs to its reply.  The cheque was accepted.  The Consumer Complaint however, was dismissed by the State Commission relying upon the decision of this Commission in CC No.97 of 2016 Ambrish Kumar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ferrous Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., decided on 07.10.2016 on noticing that the cost of the flat was more than Rs.1 Crore.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission.
2.      At the time the Consumer Complaint was instituted before the State Commission, Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was in force.  In terms of Section 17 of the Consumer Protection Act, the State Commission, at that time, had pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain a Consumer Complaint where the value of the goods purchased or the services hired or availed, as the case might be and the compensation claimed in the complaint, exceeded Rs.20 lacs but did not exceed Rs.1 Crore.
3.      As held by this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), the value of the services in such a case would be the sale consideration agreed to be paid by the flat buyer to the builder.  The following extracts from Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), are relevant in this regard:
Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, to the extent it is relevant provides that this Commission shall have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any, claimed exceeds Rs.1.00 crore.  Therefore, what has to be seen, for the purpose of determining the pecuniary jurisdiction, is the value of the goods or services and the amount of the compensation claimed in the complaint.  If the aggregate of (i) the value of the goods or services and (ii) the compensation claimed in the complaint exceeds Rs.1.00 crore, this Commission would have pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.  Similarly, if the aggregate of the value of (i) the goods or services and (ii) compensation, if any, claimed in the complaint exceeds Rs.20.00 lacs but does not exceed Rs.1.00 Crore, the State Commission would have the pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.
4.      In view of the decision of this Commission in Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), the State Commission was absolutely justified in rejecting the Consumer Complaint on the ground that it lacked pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the Consumer Complaint.  The State Commission, however, could have returned the complaint to the complainant for being presented before this Commission, instead of dismissing it for want of pecuniary jurisdiction and in that case, this Commission could have proceeded with the Consumer Complaint from the stage at which it was returned by the State Commission.  Such a course of action however, cannot be adopted at this stage considering that the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since stands repealed and has been replaced by Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and under the new Act, the pecuniary jurisdiction would not vest with this Commission.  The pecuniary jurisdiction under the new Act, may rather vest with the concerned District Forum, the complainant/appellant having paid only Rs.15 lacs to the respondent.
5.      The learned counsel for the appellant/complainant submits that the Consumer Complaint before the State Commission was instituted before the decision in Ambrish Kumar Shukla (supra), was rendered by a Three-Members Bench of this Commission.  This however, would not be relevant since this Commission only declared the law as it always was.  A Court/Tribunal does not make the law.  It only interprets the law as it always stood.  Therefore, even at the time the Consumer Complaint was instituted before the State Commission, the said Commission did not have the pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.  The complaint, at the time, ought to have been instituted before this Commission, the cost of the flat being more than Rs.1 Crore.  The consideration actually paid by the complainant would not be material for this purpose since u/s 17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the pecuniary jurisdiction was to be determined on the basis of the value of the goods or the services as the case might be and not on the basis of the consideration paid by the consumer.  The position however, is different under Consumer Protection Act, 2019.
6.      The learned counsel for the complainant/appellant submits that at the time of admission of the complaint, the State Commission was of the view that it had the requisite pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the Consumer Complaint.  In my opinion, the institution of the Consumer Complaint before the State Commission, by itself, was a mistake and the complainant/appellant ought not to have instituted it before the State Commission.  The invocation of the jurisdiction of the State Commission itself being a mistake, the complainant/appellant has no option but to undergo the process open to him in law.
","7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, no ground for interference with the impugned order is made out.  The appeal is therefore, dismissed.  It is however, made clear that dismissal of the Consumer Complaint by the State Commission shall not come in the way of the complainant/appellant approaching the appropriate consumer forum for the redressal of his remaining grievances.
The appeal stands disposed of accordingly.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :In person 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Radhakrishan .R, against the order dated 03.09.2019 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.421 of 2019.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner/complainant submitted two separate complaints from his home on 02.06.2018 through speed post no. RL085280241IN & RL085280122IN before the CDRF. It has been alleged that after receiving the applications & fees, OP1 neither provided a chance to the complainant to appear before the CDRF nor rejected the complaint. The complainant also informed OP2 about the deficiency and omission of law by OP1 but as a competent authority, no positive approach or action was taken by OP2. Hence the complainant had grievance against not registering the two complaints sent by post and therefore, filed the complaint before the District Forum. The complainant impleaded the President, CDRF (OP1) and Food & Supplies Department (OP2) as the opposite parties. District Forum in its order dated 24.12.2018 stated that there is no procedure in this forum to register the complaint(s) received through internet or post.  As stated by complainant, the two complaints referred in this complaint are already received in this forum. Further, the registry was directed to register both complaints for hearing on its admission on 8.01.2019. Accordingly, the complaint was disposed of.  State Commission vide its order dated 03.09.2019 dismissed the appeal of the complainant on the ground that:
(i)  It is not permissible to array court/presiding officer against whose order the appeal has been filed as respondent.
(ii)  Appeal was barred by limitation.
3.      Hence, the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the petitioner in person at the admission stage. The petitioner stated that the State Commission has not considered the true facts causing delay in filing the appeal before the State Commission. The petitioner stated that the complaint was filed before the District Forum for not considering and registering the two complaints sent by post. Complaint has been disposed of by the order of the District Forum dated 24.12.2018 stating that there was no procedure in the District Forum to register the complaints received by post. The District Forum also ordered registration of these two complaints. The complainant preferred appeal of this order before the State Commission however, the appeal has been dismissed on the ground of delay as well as on other grounds. The petitioner stated that District Forum is also providing a service and there was deficiency in the service that they did not register the complaints sent by post. It was requested that the revision petition may be admitted.
5.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the petitioner in person and have examined the record. The appeal was filed with a delay of about 150 days as mentioned in the application filed by the petitioner before the State Commission for condoning the delay. The application for condonation of delay mentions the reasons for delay as follows:-
“2.        It is humbly submitted that this condonation for delay application is before this Hon’ble State Commission from a order against disposal of the complaint No.483/2018 of the appellants on 24.12.2018 passed by Hon CDRF New Delhi.
3.          The True Copy of the order in CC 483/2018 received this appellant on 17th  day of January 2019 through post.  In as much the appeal ought to have been filed on 17th February 2019 but unfortunately appellant failed to file the same and that was due to delay in obtaining legal information’s & delay in obtaining the information about Hon. Supreme Court orders and observations to prepare this appeal and also due to the some financial problems. Hence a delay of 150 days is caused in filing the appeal.  The said delay is not due to my willful default.”
6.      The State Commission in the impugned order has considered the application in the following manner:-
","“4.        The application is as vague as it can be.  It does not mention as to from whom the legal information was sought, what was the point on which legal information was sought, the date on which appellant got the information.  Similarly it is not mentioned which information or observation of Hon’ble Supreme Court was sought and when the same was received.  Financial problem is no ground to condone the delay.  The application merits dismissal and the same is dismissed.  With this the appeal must automatically stand dismissed as being barred by limitation.”
7.      From the above, it is clear that the reasons given by the State Commission for dismissing the application for condonation of delay are based only on the application submitted by the petitioner for condonation of delay. The petitioner’s allegation that the State Commission has not considered the true facts which caused delay in filing the appeal is not substantiated.
8.      It is not a right of any litigant to get the delay condoned in his favor. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ram Lal and Ors. Vs. Rewa Coalfields Ltd., AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361 has observed the following:-
“It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay. This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
9.      Even if there is sufficient ground for condoning the delay, a court may not condone the delay based on the other contents of the case. In the present case, the State Commission has also observed that both the complaints sent by the complainant by post were registered by the District Forum as per the order of the District Forum dated 24th December 2018 and thus, in fact, there was no grievance left for the complainant. I also agree that the complaint was filed by the complainant before the District Forum with the allegation that the complaints sent by the complainant by post were not registered by the District Forum. The District Forum vide order dated 24-12-2018 ordered for registration of these two complaints. Thus, this order was in favor of the complainant and there was no point for filing the appeal, however, the appeal was filed by the complainant and the same was filed with delay of 150 days. The State Commission has not found the reasons given in the application for condonation of delay as sufficient cause for the delay and has dismissed the application for condonation of delay. As examined above, I do not find any reason why the application for condonation of delay should not have been dismissed by the State Commission keeping the facts of the case in view.
10.    Based on the above discussion, I find that the State Commission has rightly dismissed the appeal as being time barred. Accordingly, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 03.09.2019 passed by the State Commission which calls for any interference from this commission. Accordingly, revision petition No. 2238 of 2019 is dismissed at the admission stage.

","By way of this revision petition Metropolis land holdings private limited has challenged the order dated 1st September 2016 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab (in short ‘the State Commission) in First Appeal No. 196 of 2016.
2.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the present revision petition are that the respondent complainant filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum Amritsar alleging that respondent had paid a total amount of Rs.14, 48,000/- to the petitioner out of the total consideration amount of Rs.38,25,000/- for purchase of a flat in the petitioner's project. It was alleged that the possession was to be given within one year however, the possession was not handed over to the complainant and the project was also not progressing. The District Forum first issued a notice for 26th June 2015 and again for 17th July 2015. On this day the District Forum found that despite service the opposite party was not present and therefore the District Forum proceeded ex-parte against the opposite party. Finally, the District Forum allowed the complaint ex-parte on 8th January 2016 and directed the opposite party to refund Rs.14,48,000/- along with 9% p.a interest from the date of last payment i.e. from 11th May 2012.
3.      Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the State Commission which was dismissed vide it's order dated 1st September 2016.
4.      Hence the present revision petition.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused record. The learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that though the District Forum has not recorded any reason for assuming service on the petitioner in its order dated 17th July 2015, however, it has been found out that the notice was served on one Pradeep Sharma who has been stated to be manager of the petitioner by the process server. The fact is that there was no employee by the name of Pradeep Sharma in the whole setup of the petitioner. Thus, the service has been managed by the complainant himself and the District Forum as well as the State Commission have accepted the same. It was clearly mentioned in the memo of appeal that no such employee by the name of Pradeep Sharma was ever employed by the petitioner but the State Commission has not accepted the same. The petitioner had also filed the list of its employees duly certified by the chartered accountant but even this proof has not been accepted by the State Commission. No prejudice would have been caused to the complainant, had the State Commission remanded the matter to the District Forum for deciding the complaint after hearing the defense of the petitioner. However, the State Commission dismissed the appeal and also did not consider merit of the appeal.
6.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent complainant stated that if Pradeep Sharma was not an employee of the petitioner then, the petitioner should have filed a complaint with the police against Pradeep Sharma who has also filed an affidavit confirming the service. The fact is that the project was not proceeding and the petitioner neither refunded the amount paid by the complainant nor assured any progress in the project. In such situation, the District Forum has rightly ordered the refund of the paid amount.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and examined the material on record. The basic thrust of the argument of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that the report of service by the peon of the District Forum is not correct as the notice has been served on one Pradeep Sharma who has been stated to be manager of the petitioner whereas the petitioner has never employed any person by the name of Pradeep Sharma. The State Commission has observed the following in this regard:-
“8.    In order to prove that no such Pardeep Sharma was ever employed by the opposite party, it has placed reliance upon the certificate of Sanjeev Khanna & Company, Chartered Accountants; which was annexed with the appeal, as Annexure A-5.  As per this certificate, which was certified to be true and correct, as per the Books of Accounts produced before him and other relevant information provided to him, the opposite party had employed the following persons, who had been paid the monthly salaries upto 31.01.2016:
i)  Mr. Harkanwal Singh site Engineer    Rs.24,000/- P.M.
ii)  Mr. Aman Kumar       Accountant       Rs.7,000/- P.M.
iii)   Mr. Munish Kumar  Peon             Rs.4,500/- P.M.”
","Admittedly, the opposite party is a developer and the complaint pertained to a flat in residential project; named, “Metropolis Tower”.  It cannot be believed that such a Company would be employing only three persons. The Chartered Accountant cannot be said to be the best witness to tell or disclose the names of the employees of the Company and he can only tell about the accounts thereof.  The best witness to disclose the names of the employees was the Managing Director himself; whose affidavit was annexed with the appeal.  He nowhere deposed in that affidavit that Pardeep Sharma was never employed by the opposite party, as Manager.  In these circumstances, we do not find any ground to disbelieve the endorsement made by Pardeep Sharma on the summons, as the Manager of the opposite party.  The service of summons upon him, as Manager of the opposite party, was valid service upon the opposite party.  Therefore, there is no ground for setting aside the impugned order, on the ground that the opposite party was never served and was wrongly proceeded against ex-parte by the District Forum.  There is no merit in this appeal and the same is hereby dismissed.”
8.      I agree with the observation of the State Commission that a developer cannot have only three employees in his office and moreover, the name of the manager has not been given in the list of employees. Developers generally have a manager on every site. Thus, the list of employees given by the petitioner is not believable. This whole thing casts aspersion on the story of the petitioner. Thus, I do not find any error in the finding of the State Commission regarding service on the petitioner.
9.      In the present case, the District Forum has observed that complainant has deposited Rs.14,48,000/- with the opposite party and neither the project has been completed nor the possession has been handed over to the complainant by the opposite party. The petitioner has not denied the receipt of Rs.14,48,000/- before this Commission and the order of the District Forum is only to refund this amount along with 9% per annum interest from the date of last payment i.e. from 11th  May 2012. The order is clearly not a harsh order on the petitioner and the interest rate applied by the District Forum is quite reasonable. In these circumstances, I do not find any basis to interfere with the order passed by the State Commission.
10.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any merit in the revision petition and accordingly the revision petition No. 3433 of 2016 is dismissed.

","This consumer complaint has been filed by the complainant M/s. Shri Durga Khandsari Sugar Mills alleging deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party/Insurance Company.
2.      The facts of the case are that on 06.03.2014, the complainant involved in the business of manufacturing of sugar, purchased 3 nos. of Standard Fire and Special Perils Insurance Policies from the opposite party. As per its practice for the previous 40 years, the opposite party deputed its representatives to inspect the building and the plant machinery and the nature of goods stored in order to prescribe the most appropriate fire policy that the insured should take. The opposite party issued cover notes without furnishing any other documents delineating the terms and conditions with regard to risk against fire.  On 03.07.2014, there was an explosion in the complainant’s molasses tank resulting in a short duration fire and an exothermic reaction raising the temperature of the molasses to such high levels that it foamed and frothed and overflowed out of the tank burning into charcoal solid material resulting in a loss of 2032.90 M.T. priced at Rs.7,200/- per M.T. of total value Rs.1,46,36,880/-.  The complainant filed claim with the opposite party contending that in the first place fire has occurred and the said peril is well covered under the fire policies and in the second place it was obligatory on the part of the insurer to have advised the covering of spontaneous combustion as a peril under the Fire policy because the Insurer had the expert knowledge of the kind of policy suitable for the complainant. It is alleged by the complainant that it was only after the event that the Insurer flashed its terms and conditions of policy to contend that spontaneous combustion was not an insured peril even though it fell within the definition of “fire”.  On 18.03.2015, the opposite party’s surveyor submitted its final report opining that a loss of 2032.90 M.T. of molasses has indeed taken place but the loss is not covered under the policies issued by the opposite party. On 31.03.2015, the opposite party repudiated the claim.  The complainant has filed the instant complaint submitting that the loss in question is very well covered under the fire policies having fire alone as the covered peril without the reference to spontaneous combustion that may or may not be leading to fire.  Hence the instant complaint of the deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party in as much as it could not have in the first place issued a policy by hiding the terms and conditions knowing fully well that the only peril by which molasses can perish is spontaneous combustion and then in the second place turn around upon the happening of an accident to contend that the same peril is not covered.
3.      Notice was issued to the opposite party.  The complaint has been resisted by the opposite party by filing the written statement.  It has been stated therein that the complainant has not paid any premium for the peril of spontaneous combustion, therefore, the case of the complainant cannot be covered under the policy as the fire occurred due to spontaneous combustion in the tank where the molasses were stored.  Both the parties led their evidence by way of affidavits which have been taken on record.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the complainant stated that there was pre-inspection of the factory before issuing the insurance policies by the Insurance Company. However, neither the inspecting surveyor nor the Insurance Company suggested that the complainant should pay the additional premium for spontaneous combustion when they very well knew that the molasses are prone to fire due to spontaneous combustion. Thus, the Insurance Company tried to sell the policies from which real benefit cannot be derived.  Hence, there is a clear deficiency in service on the part of the insurance company and the complainant is entitled to get the insurance claim.  Learned counsel for the complainant referred to the case of this Commission in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Krishna Devi & 4 Ors, decided on 27.02.2015 (NC), wherein it has been observed:-
“11.   …… In the instant case, while obtaining the policy, the Complainant disclosed her date of birth, which is recorded on the policy cover, extracted above. Thus, while issuing the policy, the Insurance Company as well as its agent (O.P No.4) were fully aware of the age of the Complainant and, if because of age factor the assured cover for Medical expenses etc. could not exceed US$25000, it was incumbent upon the Insurance Company to apprise her about it. But regretfully, the Insurance Company collected higher premium on coverage assured amount of US$250000. It is not the case of the Insurance Company that the insured had concealed her age at the time of filling up the proposal form. Unfortunately, even their Agent (O.P.No.4) who had been authorized by the Complainant to obtain policy on her behalf from the Insurance Company did not bother to explain to her that because of her age, her medical insurance cover would not exceed US$25000.  Obviously, had this condition been disclosed to her, the agent would have also lost some amount of commission on account of lesser premium. It needs little emphasis that if an insured is expected to read and understand the terms and conditions mentioned in a policy, in fine print, before entering into the insurance contract, the insurer and its agent is equally obliged to carefully go through the information furnished in the proposal form and advise the insured accordingly before accepting the proposal and issuing the policy. In our view, being aware of the date of birth of the insured, it was incumbent upon the Insurance Company to apprise her about its limited liability under the policy before accepting the proposal and the premium. We are convinced that collection of excess premium from the Complainant on coverage assured amount of US$250000 and earning of higher commission by its Agent, not only tantamounts to unfair trade practice, it is equally unethical. It may not be out of place to observe at this juncture that it is high time that in a consumer oriented market, the rule of Caveat Emptor (Let the buyer beware) must give way to the rule Caveat Venditor (Let the seller beware).”
5.      It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainant that from the above observation of this Commission, the advisory role of the surveyor or agent or the Insurance Company is very clear.  Thus, the claim of loss due to fire caused by spontaneous combustion in the present case would also be covered under the policy.  In support of his argument, learned counsel for the complainant referred to the judgment of this Commission in The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Taj Sugar Works and Anr., decided on 13.08.2001 (NC) wherein this Commission has treated the spontaneous combustion as under the peril of fire and had allowed the claim of Taj Sugar Factory.  This decision clearly covers the present complaint and similar order can be passed.
6.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/Insurance Company emphasised that complainant has admitted in the complaint that fire occurred due to spontaneous combustion in the tank of molasses. Therefore, the fact of fire due to spontaneous combustion in the molasses is not disputed.  Clearly fire has been caused due to spontaneous combustion and loss due to such fire is not covered under the policy.  The allegation of the complainant is that the Insurance Company did not suggest to take the cover for spontaneous combustion also, cannot be justified because every customer takes the policy which suits him best. Insurance Company is only a seller of the policy. If special policy is required by anybody, the Insurance Company gives the same.  The complainant is a sugar factory and must be knowing what kind of policy is best suited to the Sugar Factory.  If the Insurance Company starts giving advice to the customers then allegation can be made against the officer of the Insurance Company for recommending a particular policy.  Thus, no deficiency can be attributed to the Insurance Company for not advising the complainant to take policy for spontaneous combustion also.
7.      The learned counsel stated that if complainant was taking policy for 40 years, the complainant should have realised that terms and conditions of the policy are very important and if the same was not received by the complainant then they should have tried to get the same as quickly as possible. The terms and conditions were duly supplied to the complainant. Learned counsel further argued that the assessment of loss by the surveyor does not mean that the complainant deserves indemnification of that loss.  In fact, it is the duty of the surveyor to assess the loss.  However, it is for the Insurance Company to see whether loss is payable to the insured or not.  In the present case, loss was not covered under the policy and therefore, the claim was rightly repudiated.  The surveyor has also observed in his report that actually there was no fire and the temperature in molasses tank went on increasing causing overflow and damage to the molasses.  If there was no fire, then there can be no claim under the peril of fire.
8.      Learned counsel for the Insurance Company stated that the decision of this Commission in The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Taj Sugar Works and Anr. (supra) is not applicable in the present case as there was no fire in the present case, whereas in the case of The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Taj Sugar Works and Anr. (supra), there was a fire and therefore, this Commission has treated as covered under policy.
9.      It was further stated by the learned counsel for the Insurance Company that the terms and conditions of the policy are to be construed in the same terms as they are written in the policy.  Courts cannot interpret the terms on their own and cannot rewrite the contract.  The policy clearly states that the fire due to spontaneous combustion is not covered under the policy.  No separate cover is taken for spontaneous combustion as no additional premium has been paid for this.  Thus, it is not open to the court to allow the loss suffered by the complainant on account of fire due to spontaneous combustion under the policy.  In respect of his argument, learned counsel referred to the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court in General Assurance Society Ltd. Vs. Chandumull Jain and Anr., AIR 1966 SC 1644, wherein the following has been observed:-
“11.    …………In interpreting documents relating to a contract of Insurance, the duty of the court is to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties, because it is not for the court to make a new contract, however, reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves.  Looking at the proposal, the letter of acceptance and the cover notes, it is clear that a contract of insurance under the standard policy for fire and extended to cover flood, cyclone etc. had come into being.”
10.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. It has been admitted by the complainant that the damage to molasses has occurred due to spontaneous combustion which is mentioned as an exception in the policy, that the fire caused by the spontaneous combustion is not covered under the policy.  The main thrust of the complainant is that the Insurance Company or the inspecting surveyor should have advised the complainant to take the insurance cover for spontaneous combustion also.  Clearly, there was no such instructions for the Insurance Company or the surveyor for giving advice to the persons interested in taking insurance on the type of policy to be taken.  It is only recently that such a provision has been made under IRDA (Protection of Policyholders’ Interests) Regulations, 2017 which reads as under:-
“6. Point of Sale
2.  An insurer or its agent or other intermediary shall provide all material information in respect of a proposed cover to the prospect to enable the prospect to decide on the best cover that would be in his or her interest.
3.   Where the prospect depends upon the advice of the insurer or his agent or an insurance intermediary, such a person must advise the prospect dispassionately.
4.   Where for any reason, the proposal and other connected papers are not filled in by the prospect, the insurer or the distribution channel shall explain the contents of the form, and a certificate shall be incorporated at the end of the proposal form from the prospect that the contents of the proposal form and connected documents have been fully explained to him and he has fully understood the significance of the proposed contract.”
11.    As per the above Regulations, now the Insurance Company and their agents and intermediaries are required to furnish advice also to the insured to provide all the information about the products which may be applicable for the insured.
12.    There were no such directions given in the earlier Regulations which were made by the IRDA for protection of rights of policy holders.  Learned counsel for the complainant has not shown any other provision either in the Insurance Act, 1938 or Rules made thereunder or any other document, which provides for such directions to the Insurance Company.  Thus, the deficiency in service on the part of the Insurance Company for not suggesting the complainant to take insurance cover for spontaneous combustion is not proved.
13.    Moreover, It is clear that the contract of the policy is to be interpreted as it is and in terms which are expressly provided in the contract.  The learned counsel for the opposite party has rightly relied upon the judgment of General Assurance Society Ltd. Vs. Chandumull Jain and Anr. (supra).
14.    Hon’ble Supreme Court in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sony Cherian II (1999 )CPJ 13 (SC ), has observed as follows:-
“16. The insurance policy between the insurer and the insured represents a contract between the parties. Since the insurer undertakes to compensate the loss suffered by the insured on account of risks covered by the insurance policy, the terms of the agreement have to be strictly construed to determine the extent of liability of the insurer. The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy. That being so, the insured has also to act strictly in accordance with the statutory limitations or terms of the policy expressly set out therein.”
15.    In United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Harchand Rai Chandan Lal, (2004) 8 SCC 644, the Hon’ble Apex Court held as follows:-
“6. ….The terms of the policy have to be construed as it is and we cannot add or subtract something: Howsoever liberally we may construe the policy but we cannot take liberalism to the extent of substituting the words which are not intended.
9. …It is settled law that terms of the policy shall govern the contract between the parties, they have to abide by the definition given therein and all those expressions appearing in the policy should be interpreted with reference to the terms of policy and not with reference to the definition given in other laws. It is a matter of contract and in terms of the contract the relation of the parties shall abide and it is presumed that when the parties have entered into a contract of insurance with their eyes wide open, they cannot rely on definition given in other enactment.
14. Therefore, it is settled law that the terms of the contract has to be strictly read and natural meaning be given to it. No outside aid should be sought unless the meaning is ambiguous.”
16.    The argument of complainant is that the terms and conditions of the policy were not supplied by the insurer. As the complainant was taking policy from the same insurer for a long time, the terms and conditions of the policy must have been known to the complainant.  Moreover, it has been denied by the opposite party that the terms and conditions were not supplied to the complainant.  A party who wants to take insurance for any kind of risk must try to know the details of the policy and the terms and conditions of the policy so, that insured is clear as to what kinds of risks are covered and under what conditions, in the policy.  Thus, this argument of the complainant is not tenable.
17.    On the basis of the above examination, it is clear that the allegation of the complainant that the terms and conditions were not given by the Insurance Company cannot be accepted.  The contract of policy has to be construed in the same terms in which the contract is expressed.  From these two findings, it is clear that the insurance claim of the complainant is not covered under the policy.  It has also been found that no deficiency in service can be attributed to the opposite party for not advising the complainant on the issue of insurance cover for spontaneous combustion.
","18.    Based on the above discussion, it is seen that the complainant has not been able to prove his allegation against the opposite party and the insurance claim is not payable under the insurance policy.  No deficiency of service is found against the opposite party.  Accordingly CC No.1899 of 2016 is dismissed.

The petitioner Indore Development Authority invited tenders for allotment of plots in scheme number 94 which the authority was to develop in Indore. The complainants submitted tenders for allotment of residential plots in the aforesaid scheme and the bids given by them are stated to be the highest bids. The security deposit which the complainant/respondents had deposited along with the bid however was returned to them on the ground that because of a stay granted by the Hon’ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh the petitioner had cancelled the tenders and decided to return the FDR representing the security amount. The complainants, however, did not accept those fixed deposits and sent the same again to the Authority saying that they would like to wait for the plots. Subsequently, it transpired that there was no stay in respect of Khasra Number 206 of village Piplihana where the plots for which bids were given by the complainants were to be located.
2.      Subsequently, the petitioner offered plots to the complainant at the rate of 2800 per square feet but the allotments were not accepted by them. The petitioner later informed the complainants that it was not possible to allot plots to them they having not accepted the plots at the price of Rs.2800/- and, therefore, the security amount was being returned to them along with the said letter.
3.      Being aggrieved, the complainants approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.
4.      The complaints were dismissed by the District Forum. Being aggrieved the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. Vide impugned order dated 14.11.2008 passed in the matter of Durgesh Bajaj  the State Commission allowed the appeal and directed as under:-
In view of the above factual matrix, we are of the view that Indore Development Authority should be directed to charge a sum of Rs.2800/- per sq. mtr. and 9% interest thereon upto the date of final stage for allotment of this plot. We reiterate that the Indore Development Authority shall first ascertain that the plot is not encumbered by any stay order passed by the High Court. Accordingly, this appeal is disposed of with no order as to costs.
Vide impugned order dated 12.11.2008 passed in the matter of Vikram Verma the State Commission allowed the appeal and directed as under:-
In the present case, there was no  stay from the High Court or any other impediment in the transaction. Under these circumstances, we are of the view that the Indore Development Authority should reconsider the offer and if the Authority wants to sell the plot at the rate fixed by the Collector i.e. Rs.2800/- per sq.m., the Indore Development Authority should negotiate with the appellant and pass an appropriate order. The decision should be taken within three months of the offer filed by the complainant.
5.      Being aggrieved from the orders of the State Commission the Authority is before this Commission by way of these revision petitions.
6.      The submission of the counsel for the complainant is that since the bids given by the complainants were the highest bids they were required to be accepted by the Authority. However, the record would show that the bids were not accepted by the Authority or at least the acceptance of the bids was never conveyed to the complainants. A concluded contract comes into effect only when an offer is made the said offer is accepted, and the acceptance of the offer is conveyed to the person who has made the offer. Since admittedly no acceptance of the offer of the complainants was conveyed to them no concluded contract between them and the petitioner Authority came into effect. As a result there is no privity of contract between the parties and the complainants cannot be said to have hired or availed the services of the petitioner Authority. The complainants, therefore, cannot be said to be consumers within the meaning of section 2)(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
7.      Though the authority later on offered plots at a higher rate of Rs.2800/- per square meter, the said offer was never accepted by the complainants. The complainants/respondents, therefore, had no locus standi to institute the consumer complaints against the Authority and the State Commission was not justified in passing the impugned orders.
8.      The Ld. counsel for the complainants submits that the grounds raised before this Commission were never raised by the petitioner Authority before the State Commission. That to my mind would be of no consequence since the entire issue is purely an issue of law and, therefore, can be considered at any stage.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the revision petitions are allowed and the consumer complaints are consequently dismissed with no order as to cost.
10.    It is made clear that dismissal of the consumer complaints shall not come in the way of complainants availing such remedy other than the consumer complaint, as may be available to them in law, against the petitioner.

1.      The Complainant/Petitioner had taken a Marine Insurance Policy for a sum assured of Rs.3,00,00,000/- from the Respondent in respect of consignments, which the Petitioner used to send to different places. The Complainant/Petitioner allegedly sent bags of flour to two different places, through Chandra Moleshwar Cargo Movers Transport Company, vide two separate goods receipts. These bags containing flour were allegedly damaged on account of excessive rain. The Complainant allegedly gave oral intimation of the damage to the Insurer on telephone. This is also the submission of the Petitioner/Complainant that the Insurer appointed M/s. A. Dave & Co., Ahmedabad to assess the loss to the Complainant and they assessed the loss to the Complainant at Rs.76,571/-. However, the claim was declined by the Insurer which inter alia stated in its Written Version that the Report of the aforesaid Surveyor was received by them from the Complainant and thereupon they had asked the Complainant to submit the required documents including the Goods Receipts, Authority Letter from the consignee, Damage Certificate, notice given to the carrier, reply received from the carrier, statement of driver, etc.. It was further stated in the Written Version filed by the Insurer that though GR No.23 and Damage Certificate were provided by the Complainant, the Damage Certificate did not contain the requisite assessment of the damage and the other documents sought by them were not provided. It was also stated in the Written Version that the Policy had been issued on the basis of monthly declaration to be submitted by the Complainant but the said monthly declaration had not been submitted thereby committing breach of the terms of the Policy. Since the Complainant had committed a breach of the terms of the Insurance Policy by not submitting the monthly declaration and had not provided the documents required by the Insurer, despite several reminders, the claim was not payable. It was also stated in the Written Version that no explanation had been given by the Complainant for not submitting the notice sent to the carrier, the reply received from the carrier to the said notice and Authority Letters from the consignee. It was further pointed out in the Written Version that the Complainant had not given any explanation for taking the good to Ahmedabad though they had been sent to Deesa.
2.      The District Forum having allowed the Consumer Complaint, the Insurer approached the concerned State Commission by way of an Appeal. Vide impugned Order dated 10-08-2015, the State Commission allowed the Appeal and dismissed the Consumer Complaint primarily on the grounds that (i) the Complainant had not submitted the requisite declaration; (ii) no intimation in writing was given to the Insurer and (iii) it had not been proved that the Surveyor, M/s. A. Dave & Co. had been appointed by the Insurer.
3.      It is an admitted position that under the Insurance Policy taken by the Petitioner/Complainant, a monthly declaration of the consignments sent by the Petitioner/Complainant was required to be submitted to the Insurer. It is an admitted position that such monthly declarations were not submitted to the Insurer. The case of the Petitioner/Complainant is that the declaration forms were to be supplied by the Insurer and the said forms having not been supplied despite request made to the Insurer, the Complainant could not submit the same. There is absolutely no documentary evidence of the declaration form having been requisitioned by the Petitioner/Complainant from the Insurer. In response to the letter received from the Complainant after the alleged loss had happened, the Insurer maintained that the declaration forms were never requisitioned from them. Since submission of declaration form was a mandatory term of the Insurance Policy taken by the Petitioner/Complainant, they ought to have sent a written request to the Insurer asking for such declaration form. That having not been done, the inevitable inference would be that the Complainant/Petitioner did not intend to submit the said declaration form and that is why they never asked for such declaration form in writing. In any case, even if the forms were not available with them, the Petitioner/Complainant ought to have sent the information required in the declaration, on plain paper, instead of committing breach of the policy condition by not submitting the said information at all.
4.      This is Complainant's own case that one consignment was sent by them to Deesa whereas the other consignment was sent to Ahmedabad. However, the goods of both the consignments were allegedly inspected by M/s. A. Dave & Co. at Ahmedabad. The Insurer asked the Complainant to explain how the goods destined for Deesa had reached Ahmedabad. The reply sent by the Petitioner/Complainant does not explain why the goods sent to Deesa were taken to Ahmedabad. The only reason given in the reply was that the goods were damaged on their way to Ahmedabad. The submission of the Learned Counsel for the Complainant is that the dealer who was to receive the goods at Deesa refused to receive them, the goods having got damaged. However, no such letter from the purchaser at Deesa was submitted either to the Insurer or to the District Forum.  No affidavit of the purchaser based at Deesa was filed to prove that he had refused to accept the goods at Deesa, since they had been damaged. Therefore, there is no convincing explanation for the goods of both the consignments having reached Ahmedabad.
5.      A perusal of the Survey Report of M/s. A. Dave & Co. would show that they had carried out the survey on the request of M/s. Bonafide Brokers, 138/2, Kabutarkhana, Chokha Bazar, Ahmedabad. It is, thus, evident that the aforesaid surveyors were not appointed by the Insurer, and they came to be appointed at the behest of the Complainant itself. Again, there is no explanation as to why the Complainant on its own chose to appoint a surveyor of its choice instead of requesting the Insurer to appoint a surveyor to inspect the goods and assess the loss.
6.      It is an admitted position that the Report of the surveyor was submitted by the Complainant to the Insurer on 07-11-2007. The loss allegedly happened on 26-07-2007 and even the Survey Report was prepared on 06-08-2007. The submission of the Survey Report to the Insurer after more than three months of the loss and about three months of the Report being prepared, casts serious doubts on the authenticity of the Report particularly when the surveyor who allegedly surveyed the goods at Ahmedabad was appointed at the behest of the Complainant and not by the Insurer. The receipt issued by him shows that his fee was paid by the Complainant. This would create serious doubt with respect to the correctness of the claim itself.
7.      I have perused the Goods Receipts copies of which the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted during the course of the hearing. The said Goods Receipts purport to be issued by Chandra Moleshwar Cargo Movers Transport Company, Industrial Area, Barmer. Full address of the aforesaid firm is not printed on the Goods Receipts submitted by the Complainant. The number of building/plot in Industrial Area, Barmer has not been printed on the Goods Receipts. No telephone number or GST/CST/LST number of the firm has been printed on them. There is a column meant for the name of the driver and his license. The said column has been left blank. The Goods Receipts do not contain address of the consignee, only the name of the consignee is given. No explanation is forthcoming from the Complainant for the aforesaid discrepancies found in the Goods Receipts.
8.      The entire case when viewed in the light of the facts that (i) monthly declarations were never submitted to the Insurer (ii) no intimation of the loss was given to the Insurer for three months (iii) the Complainant chose to appoint its own surveyor and (iv) there are several discrepancies in the Goods Receipts filed by the Complainant, it appears that the claim submitted by the Petitioner/Complainant is not genuine. The Order passed by the State Commission, therefore, does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
","9.      The Revision Petition is, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs.

","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

                                         Ms. Rhea Dube, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Sahara India Pariwar & anr. against the order dated 09.04.2018 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Haryana, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in First Appeal No.890 of 2016.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the complainant is wife of the deceased who invested Rs.10,000/- to purchase bond on 13.08.1998 from opposite party for a maturity period of 120 months  (10 years).  Complainant’s husband died his natural death on 31.05.2007 and so she applied for death help by submitting relevant documents to opposite party.  Inspite of submitting all the documents opposite party did not sanction death help loan amount.  Legal notice was also issued to opposite party.  Complainant filed complaint and prayed to direct opposite party to pay Rs.12,00,000/- maturity amount with 18% interest + Rs.3,00,000/- as compensation.  The District Forum vide its order dated 11.08.2016 allowed the complaint as under:-
“The complainant has been able to prove her complaint in toto and complaint of the complainant is allowed and accepted and opposite parties are directed jointly and severally:-
(i)      To pay a sum of Rs.12,00,000/- in 120 equated instalments of Rs.10,000/- per month from the date of this order after having personal guaranteed/surety from complainant for repay and of loan.The repayment of loan will start after one months of receiving last and final instalment i.e. 120th instalment of Death Help Loan.The Death Help Loan will be free of interest and if the complainant makes default in repayment of three instalments in continuously, the she will be liable for payment of interest prevailing at that particular juncture and time as per guidelines of the RBI OR opposite parties are at liberty to pay Rs.12,00,000/- in lum sum within 30 days from the date the receipt of the copy of order and complainant will be liable to repay in instalment of Rs.10,000/- per month without interest after 12 months of disbursement of Death Help Loan.
(ii)    To pay compensation for harassment, financial loss, mental agony, loss of precious time to the tune of Rs.40,000/- to the complainant.
(iii)    To pay litigation expenses to the tune of Rs.5,500/-. All the above directions are to be complied within 45 days from the receipt of the copy of this order failing which the opposite parties will be further burdened to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- (Three Lakh) as this compensation will be in addition to the above mentioned awarded amount.”
3.  Aggrieved with the order of the District Forum, the opposite party/petitioner filed an appeal before the State Commission.  The State Commission passed the following order on 09.04.2018:-
","“8.   As a sequel to above discussion, impugned order dated 11.08.2016 is modified to this extent that if the same is not complied within the period mentioned therein then OPs will be liable to pay interest @9% per annum on the benefits granted by learned District Forum in clause A from the date of filing of complaint.  Complainant will be entitled for the remaining relief as directed by learned District Forum.  The appeal is disposed of with this modification.”
4.      Hence, this revision petition.
5.       Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at the admission stage and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the District Forum and the State Commission have not considered the two main objections of the opposite party that the age of the bond holder/deceased/ insured was not correctly recorded and it cannot be said with certainty that he was below 60 years of age.  The second objection of the opposite party was that the bond holder suffered from pre-existing disease of COPD about which he had not supplied any information at the time of purchasing the policy bond and therefore, the claim amount was not payable to the complainant. It was stated by the learned counsel that different documents reveal different age of the deceased/ insured. The voter ID shows that at the time of purchasing the bond the age given in the election card was 45 years, therefore, at time of death, which occurred in 2007, the policy holder was about 53-54 years old.  Similarly in the ration card his age is mentioned more or less the same.  However, in the discharge summary his age is mentioned 60 years.  It means that he may be more than 60 years also and therefore, the complainant is not entitled to get claim benefit as the claim is only payable if the insured dies between 16 years and 60 years.
6.      With respect to the disease of COPD, which is pulmonary disease, the learned counsel stated that the discharge summary clearly states that the insured died of COPD though no time is mentioned since when the insured was suffering from this disease. However, this disease takes 10-20 years to develop and therefore, it must be existing prior to 1998 when the bond was issued to the life assured.  Learned counsel argued that no information was given by the bond holder at the time of purchasing of the bond in respect of the COPD from which the complainant was suffering.
7.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and examined the record.  First of all, it is seen that even on the basis of two documents i.e. the election ID card and ration card, the age of the insured was 53-54 years at the time when he died.  Thus, there can be no basis for accepting the age of the deceased life assured (DLA) to be 60 years on the basis of the discharge summary of the hospital. Therefore, this ground taken by the petitioner/opposite party is totally frivolous. Coming to the pre-existing disease COPD, it is seen that the discharge summary only mentions that the insured was suffering from COPD and died due to COPD.  It does not give any period for which the deceased insured was suffering from COPD.  Even if the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is accepted that it takes 20 years to develop the disease of COPD, the fact remains that even if it is developing inside the body, the person may not know that this is COPD until he suffers from disease and it is diagnosed to be COPD. As no proof has been filed by the petitioner/opposite party in respect of the allegation that the insured was suffering from COPD prior to 1998, the allegation cannot be accepted only on the basis of the discharge summary, which does not give any time period for the suffering of insured from COPD.  Both the fora below have giving concurrent finding of fact that the deceased insured was not ineligible due to age and was not suffering from any pre-existing disease.  Against this concurrent finding of fact, this Commission cannot reassess the fact. Hence, the scope of the revision petition is quite limited as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Lourdes Society Snehanjali Girls Hostel and Ors. Vs. H&R Johnson (India) Ltd. and others, (2016) 8 Supreme Court Cases 286, which reads as under:-
“23.  The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.  In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.”
8.      On the basis of the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 09.04.2018 of the State Commission which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Consequently, the revision petition No.2210 of 2018 is dismissed at the admission stage.

  For the Opp.Party      :
","C.VISWANATH
1.       Complainant, sole proprietor of M/s Paramount Import and Export Corporation, was in the business of trading/export of teak logs and cashews. According to the Complainant he came into contact with Opposite Parties 2 to 8, who were providing financial and collateral securities services. At the behest of Opposite Party No.2, he opened an account with Opposite Party No.1/Scheduled Bank. He took an overdraft facility for Rs.331.74 lakhs, against his own pledged deposits/collateral securities. As he got a deal from the Forestry Commission, Government of Ghana, for which credit facilities were required, he got his limits enhanced by an additional amount of Rs.150 lakhs, against the pledged deposits/collateral securities provided by Opposite Parties 2 to 8. In March, 2009 additional credit facilities were enhanced from Rs.150 lakhs to Rs.475 lakhs, apart from renewal of the earlier overdraft limit of Rs.331.74 lakhs. The grievance of the Complainant is that Opposite Party No.1 kept him in dark about the transactions in his account and did not provide any statement of accounts, all this in conspiracy/collusion with Opposite Parties 2 to 8, though he had repeatedly sought for the same. He was totally unaware of the fact that the securities pledged by the Opposite Parties No 2 to 8 for obtaining overdraft facility had already been pledged for their own credit facilities. Further, Opposite Party No.1, without informing him or taking his consent, made payments to Opposite Parties 2 to 8 by illegally breaking his pledged deposits. At the same time, cheques issued by him to other vendors were dishonoured. Credit facilities valid upto 31.05.2010 were prematurely withdrawn. Opposite Party No.1, issued letter seeking payment of Rs.2,64,44,996.19, as being the amount allegedly withdrawn from his account, beyond overdraft limits. Another letter was issued requiring payment of Rs.2,67,35,789.92, as being the amount of allegedly overdrawn from his account. On 01.10.2010, again another letter was issued recalling the loan and demanding payment of Rs.7,82,69,327.92. During the arbitration proceedings, the Complainant stated that to his utter surprise, he received a letter from Opposite Party No.1 seeking replenishment of the amount equivalent to the term deposit in respect of Singhanias and Mrs. Anju Rustogi. The Complainant was never informed nor was aware who Mrs. Rustogi was and had no dealings with her whatsoever. Mrs. Anju Rustogi initiated civil suit alleging that Opposite Party No.1 illegally utilized her pledged deposit for making advances/loans to the Complainant without her consent. The Complainant had also been made a party as Respondent in the civil suit.
2.       Action was also initiated by Opposite Party No.1 against the Dy. Chief Officer/Manager Manager, Santacruz Branch for the irregularities committed by him, pertaining to various accounts, including that of the Complainant. A charge-sheet was issued to him on 22.12.2010. The Manager was dismissed from the Bank on 01.12.2011. Charge-sheet/final report under Section 173 Cr. P.C. was filed by EOW, Mumbai in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate consequent to FIR No.32/2014.
3.       Despite the knowledge of fraudulent activities of the Branch Manager from at least 28.11.2008, he was allowed to continue with full powers by Opposite Party No.1. Opposite Party No.1 also pledged the deposits/collateral securities of Opposite Party No.9 for the credit facilities to the Complainant, about which neither the Complainant was informed nor his consent taken. Several illegal payments were made from his account. The conspiracy between Opposite Party No.1 and Opposite Parties 2 to 8 resulted in violation of contractual obligations and constituted deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. The Complainant faced several legal proceedings and suffered mental agony which seriously affected his business. Opposite Parties 2 to 8 being in hand in glove with Opposite Party No.1, jointly and severally put the Complainant to huge financial loss. The Complainant received notices under Section 13 (2) read with Section 13 (13) of SARFAESI Act, 2002. The Complainant also could not get any relief from the Arbitrator as the award was passed on 02.08.2014 against the Complainant, without taking into account his defense, based on fraud. The Complainant was forced to approach Hon’ble Bombay High Court challenging the arbitration award. Conspiracy between Opposite Party No.1 and Opposite Parties 2 to 8 led to illegal and unprompted overdrafts, finally declaring the Complainant’s account as irregular and NPA.
4.       The Complainant was not able to seek his livelihood as a trader of teak logs, being extremely preoccupied with multifarious litigation, apart from lack of liquidity, comprising inter-alia of (a) civil suit No.405/2015 before Hon’ble Mumbai High Court (b) arbitration petition No. 1181/2019 (c) criminal case before Metropolitan Magistrate, Bandra (d) EOW investigation followed by trial before the Court (e) Dindhoshi City Civil Court Addl. CMM relating to Goregaon property CS No.296/2019 (f) Multiple cases under Section138 of NI Act (g), and arbitration before Arbitrator.
5.       Complainant suffered huge damage due to acts and omissions of Opposite Party No.1 and Opposite Parties 2 to 8. Therefore, the Complainant filed the present Consumer Complaint with the following prayer: -
(i) Award damages as per law as mentioned in para 32 with interest as mentioned herein at reasonable rate looking to facts and circumstances of the case.
(ii)         Direct the OP No.1 Bank to credit the complainant’s account by reversal of illegal interest and payments debited therein and release complainant’s collateral securities and deposit securities with interest.
(iii)        Direct OP No.1 to 8 to provide guarantee/indemnity to thereby indemnify the complainant that may arise from final outcome of civil suit No.2642/2011 in City Civil Court Room No.14 Mumbai filed by OP No.9 and that may arise from unauthorised transactions carried on the complainant’s account by OP No.2 to 8 by misusing blank signed cheques provided as part of financial services contract.
(iv)         Award cost damages and interest.
(v)          Grant such further relief as may be considered just and appropriate by this Hon’ble Commission in the facts and circumstances of the case.
6.       Heard the learned Counsels for the Complainant and carefully perused the record. Learned Counsel for the Complainant submitted that the Complainant had opened bank account with Opposite Party No.1/Bank with credit facility. Opposite Party No.1 in collusion with Opposite Parties 2 to 8 made several transactions in his bank account without his consent. When the Complainant asked for the statement of accounts, they failed to provide the same. The securities pledged by the Opposite Parties for obtaining overdraft facility had already been pledged for their own credit facilities. It was also submitted that Opposite Party No.1/Bank made several payments to Opposite Parties 2 to 8 without consent/information of the Complainant. Credit facilities valid upto 31.05.2010 were also withdrawn prematurely. On the aforesaid allegations Complainant filed the present Complaint with the prayer as indicated above.
","7.       Complainant opened an account with Opposite Party No.1/Scheduled Bank with overdraft facility of Rs.331.74 lakhs against his pledged/collateral securities. Overdraft facility was enhanced to Rs.475 lakhs pledging deposits/securities of Opposite Parties No. 2 to 8. According to the Complainant, Opposite Party No.1 did not inform about the transactions in his account and did not provide statement of account. All these transactions were done in collusion with Opposite Parties 2 to 8. Opposite Party No.1, without the consent of the Complainant, made payments to Opposite Parties 2 to 8, by illegally breaking his pledged deposits. Credit facilities valid upto 31.05.2010 were withdrawn prematurely. Opposite Party No.1 issued letters to the Complainant demanding payment of Rs.2,64,44,996.19, Rs.2,67,35,78.92 and Rs.7,82,69,327.92 respectively, as being the amounts withdrawn from his account beyond overdraft limits. Opposite Party No.1 took action against Dy. Chief Officer/Manager, for the irregularities committed by him. Manager, Santacruz Branch was also dismissed from the Bank for financial irregularities. Action was initiated under the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and arbitration proceedings initiated. According to the Complainant, despite the knowledge of the fraudulent activities of the Branch Manager, he was allowed to continue with full powers by the Bank. Opposite Party No.1 also pledged the deposits/collateral securities of Opposite Party No.9 for the credit facilities to the Complainant, about which neither the Complainant was informed nor his consent taken.
8.       In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is very essential to verify the authenticity and genuineness of the fraud/misuse of collateral securities by Opposite Party No.1. The matter gets further complicated by the allegation that the deposits/securities of Mrs. Rustogi were also pledged by Opposite Party No.1, without the consent of the Complainant. Complainant claims that he was never informed nor was aware who Mrs. Rustogi was and had no dealing with her. Manager, Santacruz Branch was also dismissed from the Bank for financial irregularities. Multiple litigations are pending in the present case. The case involves complex and complicated questions of facts and issues requiring detailed oral examination, backed by documentary evidence, which can only be appropriately adduced and adequately dealt with in a Civil Court, after all necessary parties join the proceedings. Elaborate pleadings and documents would be required to adjudicate the dispute. It is not a case to be heard and disposed of in a summary fashion.
9.       In view of the above, the Consumer Complaint is hereby dismissed as not maintainable in the Consumer Forum. Liberty, however, is granted to the Complainant to approach the appropriate Civil Court/Forum.

2.       The Revision Petition No. 434 of 2020 has been filed by the Life Insurance Corporation, Delhi and Faridabad through their Deputy Secretary (Legal) against the Order dated 16.12.2019, passed by the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Panchkula (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission), whereby the First Appeal No. 886 of 2019 preferred by the Petitioners herein has been dismissed and the Order dated 01.08.2019, passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Faridabad (hereinafter referred to as “the District Forum”) in Consumer Complaint No. 176 of 2018 has been affirmed.

5.       As all the four Revision Petitions involved a common question, they are being heard together and decided by a common Order.
6.       Briefly stated facts giving rise to the present Revision Petitions are as follows:
Mr. Harbir Singh (deceased) (hereinafter referred to as “the Insured”) had taken 21 life Insurance Policies from the Life Insurance Corporation through an Agent.
Insurance Policies were issued in the name of the Insured.
The Insured used to deposit the regular premium installments.
The Insured was an income tax payee.
The Insured was murdered on 28.09.2015.
In the Insurance Policies the Insured has declared Smt. Rani Devi, his mother as nominee.
Smt. Rani Devi filed Application claiming the amount of Insurance in respect ofInsurance Policies taken by her son, Harbir Singh (deceased) (the Insured), who had died on 28.09.2015.
The Life Insurance Corporation had repudiated the claim of the Complainant/ Respondent herein on the ground that the 20 policies of ₹1,00,000/- each had been taken by the Insured on misrepresentation of the facts as in 20 Policies the Insured had declared to be an Employee, whereas, in one Policy he had declared himself to be a Businessman.
7.       In Revision Petition No. 433 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹5,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹25,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹4,75,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 175 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹4,75,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
8.       In Revision Petition No. 434 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹6,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹30,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹5,70,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 176 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹5,70,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
9.       In Revision Petition No. 435 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹4,00,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹20,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹3,80,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 177 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹3,80,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
10.     In Revision Petition No. 436 of 2020, out of the total claim amount of ₹7,30,000/-,  the Life Insurance Corporation had paid a sum of ₹25,000/- only and the balance amount of ₹7,05,000/- had not been paid, which forced Smt. Rani Devi to file a Complaint before the District Forum being Consumer Complaint No. 178 of 2018. The District Forum vide Order dated 01.08.2019 has directed payment of ₹7,05,000/- along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the Complaint till its realization, ₹5,000/- as compensation on account of mental tension and agony and ₹3,000/- as litigation expenses.
","11.     Feeling aggrieved by the Orders of the District Forum, the Petitioners herein preferred four separate First Appeals before the State Commission being First Appeal Nos. 885 to 888 of 2019, which have been dismissed by the State Commission vide four separate Orders dated 16.12.2019. The State Commission while dismissing the Appeals in paragraph 10 of the impugned Order has recorded the following findings of facts:
“10.    After hearing learned counsel for the appellant and careful perusal of the evidence available on the record of the District Forum, I am of the view that there is no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order passed by the learned District Forum.  Perusal of the impugned order reveals that “upon close perusal  of the two proposal forms for the four complaints filed in this forum in complaint Nos. 178/2018, 177/2018, 176/2018 and 175/2018, it is observed that both are dated 10.01.2015 and the agent is common for both. In one proposal form, the occupation is shown as employee, whereas in the another, it is shown as business/property dealer. The same agent got two proposal forms filled on the same day and did not take note of the variation shown in occupation in the two forms. This is highly unlikely.  It is evident whatever was filled in the forms was filled with the connivance of the agent.”
12.     Feeling aggrieved by the Orders dated 16.12.2019, passed by the State Commission, the Petitioners have preferred four separate Revision Petitions before this Commission.
13.     We have heard Mr. Arvind Kumar, learned Counsel for the Petitioners and perused the impugned Orders passed by the State Commission. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that Mr. Harbir Singh (deceased) had submitted 21 Proposal Forms on the same day, out of which in 20 Proposal Forms he had declared himself as an employee of M/s. Ansal Ltd., whereas in one Proposal Form he had shown himself to be Businessman  and therefore there was a fraud committed by the Insured and Life Insurance Corporation was perfectly justified in not giving the insured amount to the Claimant.
14.     The submission is wholly misconceived. As it is not in dispute that all the 21 Proposal Forms were of the same date i.e. 10.01.2015, it is presumed that the Agent must have submitted all the 21 Proposal Forms to the  Branch Office of Life Insurance Corporation on a single day itself because the Life Insurance Corporation (Petitioners) have not taken any such ground either in the repudiation letter or before the foras below. When all the Proposal Forms have been submitted on the same day, it was obligatory and also a duty of the Life Insurance Corporation to verify the same and not blindly accept the Proposal Forms. As the Life Insurance Corporation in the present case had issued 21 Insurance Policies to the Insured, this itself shows the act of acceptance of the Proposal Forms submitted by the Insured. As already referred to above the State Commission in Paragraph 10 of the impugned Order had examined the various Proposal Forms submitted by the Insured and had recorded a finding that the same Agent got two Proposal Forms filled on the same day and did not take note of the variation shown in occupation of the two Forms, which is highly unlikely and appears to have been filled with the connivance of the Agent.
15.     In our considered opinion the findings recorded by the State Commission are based on appreciation of evidence and material on record and do not suffer from any material irregularity or error. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the “Mrs. Rubi (Chandra) Dutta vs. M/s United India Insurance Co. Ltd.”,  (2011) 11 SCC 269,  the jurisdiction of this Commission, while exercising its powers under Section  21 (b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is very limited and we cannot appraise the evidence afresh.
16.     In view of the foregoing discussion, we do not find any merit in these Revision Petitions and are accordingly dismissed in limine.

  For the Petitioner     :MR. KISHORE RAWAT 
  For the Respondent      :MR. VARSHAL M. PANCHOLI 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainants/respondents obtained separate Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy from the petitioner insurance company w.e.f. 19.09.2001 to 18.08.2002 in respect of the stock kept in their respective cold storage premises.  A fire broke out in the cold storage on 06.05.2002 and resulted in loss/damage of the goods kept therein.  On intimation being given to the insurer a surveyor was appointed who duly assessed the loss suffered by the complainant.  The claim, however, was repudiated vide letter dated 12.10.2003 which reads as under:-
As per intimation and survey report, the stock of imali, katri and potato wafers were damaged on account of fire which were stored at Madhukant Cold Storage. As per the proposal form your intention was to cover stock of chillies, grains, spices only and work such other goods were added only with an intention that no such other goods relating to stock of chillies, grains and spices could be left out. Whereas, upon perusing the definitions of chillies, grains and spices, the stock of imli, katri and potato wafers cannot be included as insured stock.
Thus, stock of imIi, katri and potato wafers have not been covered under the policy, therefore, we are unable to indemnify your losses due to fire and we are closing your claim file as NO CLAIM.
2.      The complainants approached the Insurance Ombudsmen for Gujarat  but their representation was rejected by the said Ombudsmen.  The complainants, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.  The complaints were dismissed by the District Forum.
3.      Being aggrieved from the order of the District Forum, the complainants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.
4.      Vide impugned order dated 24.12.2014 the State Commission allowed the appeals filed by the complainants and directed the insurer to pay the amount assessed by the surveyor with 9% interest.  Being aggrieved the insurer is before this Commission by way of these revision petitions.
5.      The relevant clause of the policy described the insured goods as “stock of chilli, grains, spices and such other goods”. The stock which got destroyed in the fire comprised katri (potato chips), potato wafers and tamarind (imli). The only disputed question involved in this case is as to whether the aforesaid would be covered under the expressed “and such other goods” since the aforesaid goods were not chili, grains or spices.
6.      I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the petitioner that the words “and such other goods” have to be read ejusdem generis with the words chilli, grains and spices.  The question which then arises is as to what kind of goods can be said to be goods such as chilli, grains and spices.  The insurance policy does not define the term “and such other goods”. It is settled legal proposition that if the terms used in an insurance policy are ambiguous the benefit of such ambiguity would go to the insured, the insurer  being the author of the said terms.  It is also a settled legal proposition that if two views of the matter are reasonably possible, the view which favours the consumers needs to be taken.
7.      In the absence of any guiding factor in the insurance policy the words “and such other goods”, to my mind, would mean the goods which do not constitute chilli, grains or spices but which are grown and are meant for human consumption.  Chilli, grains and spices are food items which are grown and are used for human consumption.  The same is the position with respect to potato which is grown in the field and is meant for human consumption in various forms including potato chips and potato wafers.  Tamarind (imli) is also a product which is grown and is meant for human consumption  to enhance the taste of the food.  Therefore, in my opinion, it is reasonably possible to say that potato and its products such as potato chips and potato wafers as well as tamarind (imli) would be covered under the expression “and such other goods” used in the insurance policy.  Even if it is possible to take a contrary view the view favourable to the consumer needs to be preferred, the said view being a fair and reasonable view.  In any case, the insurer before issuing such a policy ought to have ensured that vague expression such as “and such other goods” are not used in the insurance policy without defining the term “such other goods” and without giving any guidance as to what kind of goods said to be goods such as chilli, grains and spices.  The benefit of such omission will go to the consumer.
","8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the view taken by the State Commission does not call for any interference of this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.  Revision petitions are, therefore, dismissed with no order as to costs.
9.      The amount which the insurer had deposited with this Commission shall be released to the complainants along-with interest which may have accrued on that amount. The insurer shall be liable to pay the interest on the principal amount in terms of the order of the State Commission only till the date on which the principal amount was deposited with this Commission.

Revision Petitions
The respondent is a cooperative society registered under Karnataka State Societies Act, 1959.  The respondent society applied to the Government of Karnataka for acquiring land for making allotment to it.  The society intended to develop that land into residential sites for allotment to its members.  A notification under Section-4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued by the Government of Karnataka, for acquiring agricultural land in Arehalli Village, Uttarahalli Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk on 11.12.1986 followed by a notification under Section-6 of the Land    Act on 11.01.1988.  The award came to be passed by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on 03.12.1989.  Several land owners filed a Writ Petition in Karnataka High Court challenging the acquisition of land.  The acquisition was quashed by the Hon’ble High Court on 18.06.1991 and the Special Leave Petition against the order of the High Court was dismissed by the Hon’ble High Court on 21.02.1995.  As a result the land was returned by the Special Land Acquisition Officer to the land owners.
2. Since the residential sites were not made available to the complainants, by the society, the complainants/petitioners approached the concerned District Forum by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking refund of the amount which they had paid to the society along with compensation etc.
3. The complaints were resisted by the respondent-society which interalia stated in its written version that the acquisition of the land having been quashed and the land having been returned by the Special Land Acquisition Officer to its owners, they were not in a position to provide the residential sites to the complainants.  It was also stated in the written version that the Land Acquisition Officer had also made deduction of more than Rs.33 lacs towards audit fees etc., from the amount which the society has deposited with him.  The society expressed its difficulty in making payment to the complainants.
4. The District Forum having directed refund of the amount paid by the complainant/petitioners to the respondent society along with interest @ 12% p.a., the respondent society approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.  Vide impugned order dated 05.07.2018, the State Commission allowed the appeals to the extent that while maintaining the directions for refund of the principle amount to the complainants, the direction for payment of interest was set aside.  Being aggrieved, the complainants/petitioners are before this Commission.
5. The learned counsel for the complainants/petitioners has drawn my attention to the decision of this Commission dated 16.12.2013 in Revision Petition Nos. 1189/2011, 1190/2011 and 1191/2011—Amarjyothi House Building Cooperative Society Ltd. Vs. V.S. Pradeep, S. Shivananda and V.S. Manjunath, whereby this Commission maintained the directions for refund of the principal amount with interest @ 12% p.a. to several other members of the society, who had taken residential sites with the respondent society.
","A perusal of the decision of this Commission in Amara Jyothi House Building Co-operative Society Ltd. (Supra) would show that the respondents therein had made payments to the society for allotment of residential sites in Sarakki Layout.  Admittedly, the site subject matter of the consumer complaints in the above referred decision of this Commission was also to be developed by the respondent society out of the land which the Government of Karnataka had to acquire for the respondent vide notification dated 11.12.1986 and 11.01.1988 followed by the award dated 03.12.1989.  Admittedly, the site in those matters could not be provided to the complainants on account of the acquisition of the land having been quashed by the Karnataka High Court vide its order dated 18.06.1991.  The consumer complaints filed in that batch of matters were contested by the society on the same ground on which the consumer complaints subject matter of these petitions have been contested.  It was inter-alia stated by the society that the land acquisition having been quashed by the High Court and the Special Leave Petitions having been dismissed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the sites could not be provided to the aforesaid complaint.  It was also stated by the society that the amount collected from the members was utilised for payment of compensation to the land owners and the society had spent the entire money which it had collected from the members.  It was also submitted that it was not in a position to make allotments or to execute the sale deed, no land being available with it for allotment.  The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaints and directed refund of the principal amount, with interest @ 12% p.a., the society approached the concerned State Commission by way of the appeals.  The said appeals also having been dismissed, the society approached this Commission by way of separate petitions.  Dismissing the Revision Petitions filed by the society, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
“…
22. Even on merits, petitioner has no case at all as petitioner itself in its written statement has categorically stated:
The Society for reasons stated above is not in apposition to allot or execute the sale deed in favour of the complainant since no lands are available for formation of sites.
23. Thus, as per petitioner’s own case, if it is not in a position to allot or execute sale deed in favour of the complainants as no lands are available for formation of sites, then we fail to understand as to under what legal authority, petitioner is retaining the hard-earned money of the respondents, received by it more than 25 years ago.  The conduct of the petitioner society is admittedly deplorable.
24. Under these circumstances, we hold that present revision petitions are most bogus and frivolous one and have been filed just to harass the respondents.  To a large extent petitioner society has succeeded in depriving the respondents, the fruits of the award which was passed many years ago.  Therefore, we hold that present revision petitions are not maintainable being barred by limitation, Even otherwise, these petitions are not sustainable on merits also.”
6. The learned counsel for the respondent submits that since 1986, the money collected by the society was lying deposited with the Government and they had not received any interest from the Government on the said amount.  It is also his submission that it would be unfair to the society if it is made to pay the interest to the complainants without receiving any interest from the Government on the amount which society had deposited with the said Government.
7. Since I am bound by decision rendered by a coordinate bench of this Commission, it is not open to me to re-examine the same issue again and take a contrary view.  The order passed by the State Commission being contrary to the view taken by this Commission in the above referred case cannot be sustained and same is accordingly set aside.  The orders passed by the District Forum are consequently restored.  The Revision Petitions stand disposed of accordingly.

","This appeal has been filed by the appellant Sheetal Medicare Products Pvt. Ltd. against the order dated 29.10.2015 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra, Mumbai (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Complaint No. RBT/CC/13/82.
2.    Brief facts of the case are that on 31.05.2005 the appellant-company had taken insurance cover and the factory premises, plant & machinery, stocks lying at Wada factory were insured with the opponent under Standard Fire & Special Peril Policy bearing No. 140600/11/05/00000889.The sum assured was Rs.75 Lakhs.Under the said policy, the risk covered was for Rs. 5 Lakhs towards building, Rs.10 Lakhs towards plant and machinery and other stocks, Rs.60 Lakhs including medicines, raw material located at factory at Wada District Thane.Due to heavy rains in the area, the complainant’s factory got badly affected and the stocks stored in the basement godown were submerged in the flood water and the damage caused by the flood was immediately reported to the insurance company on 27.7.2005.On 31.07.2005 the insurance company appointed a surveyor to assess the damage caused to the complainant’s property including the plant, machinery etc. The surveyor visited the site on 10.08.2005.Surveyor assessed the loss and recommended the amount of Rs.40,89,416/- and submitted his report on 16.08.2006. Thereafter, respondent/opposite party appointed an investigator who recommended the insurance company to repudiate the claim on the ground that the bills supplied by the complainant’s supplier were fictitious and submitted his report dated 23.01.2008.On 16.04.2008 appellant/complainant received the repudiation letter wherein it was mentioned that the stocks purchased from M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma were never brought to India and stocks claimed to have been purchased from Nepal company were not in existence, therefore, invoice produced could not be said to be genuine invoice and the company had made an attempt to obtain undue benefits under the policy and it invited invocation of Condition No. 8 of the said policy.On 02.07.2009 appellant filed a consumer complaint before the State Commission and the same was dismissed by the State Commission vide its order dated 19.06.2012 on the ground of limitation and copy of same was received by the appellant on 30.07.2012.Thereafter, appellant filed an appeal bearing no. 538/2012 before this Commission and vide order dated 28.02.2013 this Commission remanded the matter back to the State Commission to decide the same on merits.The State Commission decided the complaint filed by the appellant/complainant on merits and dismissed the same vide order dated 29.10.2015.Hence the present appeal.
3.    Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the material on record.
4.     Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant have purchased the raw medicinal material from M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma and stocks were duly insured by the insurance company.After the loss, the surveyor was appointed by the insurance company and the surveyor verified the damaged material and got it tested from the expert and then reached to the conclusion that the damaged material was same for which the claim was lodged with the insurance company.Finally, after the verification of the stocks and the stock register etc., the surveyor assessed the loss of Rs.40,89,416/-.However, insurance company later appointed an investigator who gave the finding that the alleged material purchased from M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma have been found to be fake and no such material was imported from Nepal as there was no entry in the Plant Quarantine Station of Nepal or of India in this regard.Based on this, the investigator concluded that the insurance claim was “fraudulent claim”, therefore, insurance company repudiated the same under condition 8 of the policy.
5.     It was argued that the surveyor was appointed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938 and surveyor is an independent assessor of the loss and his report is to be valued and given importance for deciding the claim.Surveyor had also sent samples to the testing laboratory for confirmation that the damaged products were the same for which purchase invoices were submitted.The surveyor has stated that the same was confirmed.It was further argued that if there was no such material, how the surveyor could have sent samples to the laboratory for testing and how the test could have confirmed the same.Permission to destroy the damaged material was also obtained and all the damaged material was destroyed before the surveyor.The surveyor has clearly stated that he has verified the stocks physically and from all the documents like purchase bills, stock register etc.The insurance company has not alleged that the surveyor has given a biased report in favour of the complainant.Had this been the case, the insurance company would have black-listed the surveyor.However, nothing of this sort has been filed to prove the same.
6.    It was argued by the learned counsel for the complainant that the complainant has no connection with the exporter of the products at Nepal. They are not concerned with the import of the material and they are only concerned with the fact that the appellant/complainant has purchased the raw medicinal material from the Indian firms M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma.If any violation of law has been committed by the Indian companies M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma,then they are responsible for the same and action can be taken against them.It is clear that the material was purchased by the appellant from the Indian companies M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma, and the same was insured with the opposite party/respondent.The surveyor has also corroborated the same after physically verifying the stock and tallying it with the stock register and other relevant documents.Therefore, the claim is not based on fraudulent purchase rather, the claim is genuine and supported by the surveyor’s report.Thus, clearly repudiation under condition no. 8 is not justified, which reads as under:-
8.            If the claim be in any respect fraudulent or if any false declaration be made or used in support thereof or if any fraudulent means or devices are used by the insured or any one acting on his behalf to obtain any benefit under the policy or if the loss or damage be occasioned by the wilful act or with the connivance of the insured, all benefits under this policy shall be forfeited.”
7.     Learned counsel for the appellant contended that though the report of the investigator has been filed by the insurance company, no affidavit of the investigator has been filed and the appellant could not get any chance to cross-examine the investigator.It was further argued by the counsel for the appellant/complainant that the present appeal has been filed with delay of 36 days though Registry has reported the delay of 45 days.It was further submitted that the order was posted by the office of the Registry on 18th November, 2015 or thereafter and the appellant has received the certified copy of the same on 26th November, 2015.Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the period for filing the appeal expired on 26.12.2015 and therefore, delay of approximately 36 days in filing the present appeal has occurred.Learned counsel further submitted that the delay is unintentional and caused due to reasons beyond the control of the appellant.It was prayed that the delay may be condoned as the case of the appellant is very strong on merits.
8.     On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/insurance company stated that the appeal has been filed with delay of 45 days and the appeal is liable to be dismissed on this count as no proper explanation has been given for the delay. Learned counsel for the respondent/insurance company further stated that the investigator in its report has clearly narrated all the aspects relating to import of the raw medicinal material by two firms i.e.M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma from whom the complainant has allegedly purchased these materials.It has been found by the investigator that the material was not properly imported and in fact there is no proof of any such import.Investigator has visited the concerned exporter in Nepal and he has also taken certificates from the Plant Quarantine Stations of the exporting destination as well as of the importing destination.There is no entry of any such import in the Plant Quarantine Stations of Nepal or India, clearly implying that appellant/complainant could not have purchased these materials from Indian suppliers M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma.The investigator has clearly pointed out that it was fraudulent claim and based on the investigator’s report, claim was repudiated.When the source of the purchase is unlawful, the purchase cannot be held to be lawful and if the purchase is unlawful, no insurance claim becomes payable.It has been argued that the State Commission has already examined this matter in detail and has observed the following:-
“Complainant bought the raw material from Yogini Ayur Pharma with sale office at Dadar Mumbai amounting to Rs.16,78,560/ plus Rs.4,24,320/-, plus Rs.4,95,040/- plus Rs.25,17,840/- totalling Rs.51,15,760/- on various dates supported by tax invoice issued by Yogini Products.  The supplier, as reported by the investigator, imported the raw material from M/. Dharma Kumar Rauniyar and Madhan Rai Panchattar of Nepal.  On report of the investigator, opponent verified authenticity of import of raw material from Nepal and it was found that M/s. Yogini Products and M/s. Yogini Ayur Pharma, the suppliers have not obtained import, export, code number or license from Government of India as required under the provisions of relevant law.  This fact is confirmed by the Government of India, Ministry of Commerce (Enforcement division) by letter dated 17/01/2008.
Investigation Report further confirmed that M/s. Dharam Kumar Rauniyar and Madhan Rai Panchattar of Nepal did not have the requisite permission to export the raw material in question purchased by the complainant company through M/s. Yogini Ayur Pharma.  This fact was confirmed by letter dated 09/01/2008 of Ministry of Agriculture & Co-Op. Department of Agriculture, Bhairahawa, Rupandehi, Nepal and letter dated 17/01/2008 of Ministry of Commerce, Mumbai 400 020 from M/s. Yogini Ayur Pharma’s paid imports without legal permission deprived State Ex-chequer of receivable debt/taxes, which amounts to fraudulent transaction.  Opponent after investigating the claim arrived at a conclusion that the complainants have violated provisions of condition no. 8 and filed a fraudulent claim based on the transaction without lawful sanctity.  Opponents revoked the claim by invoking the said condition.”
9.    The investigator has also obtained information from the Director General of Foreign Trade Office and it has clearly been stated that no permission was given to M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma to import these materials from Nepal.Once the material was not imported, it was not possible by M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma to have sold these products to the purchaser/complainant.Thus, definitely the claim was a fraudulent claim and could not be allowed on the basis of investigator’s report.Investigator’s report is based on various letters which have been issued by government agencies, therefore, they have to be taken at their face value and in this perspective, there was no need to file any affidavit of the investigator.
10.     I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by both the parties and have examined the record.First of all, the Registry has reported 45 days in filing the present appeal though the appellant has stated that there is a delay of only 36 days.Be that as it may, it has been stated in the application for condonation of delay that the delay has occurred due to the fact that a law and order situation developed in the factory premises due to certain objections of the local residents though the same was pacified due to intervention of the police, which provided security to the premises. Later on, the employees of the factory joined the Maharashtra Rajya Kamgar Sangh and therefore the work suffered in the factory.As the delay is only of 36 or 45 days, and there seems to be no intention on the part of the appellant to get the matter delayed, I deem it appropriate to condone the delay in filing the present appeal.
","11.    In the present case, the appellant has taken an insurance from respondent – insurance company for certain products which were damaged in the flood and inundation.The surveyor has assessed the loss and has recommended the claim.The insurance company was not satisfied with the report of the surveyor and they appointed an investigator to re-verify certain aspects in the matter.The investigator after exhaustive examination of the records of the parties, finally gave his report dated 23.01.2008, whereby it has been claimed that the material that was supplied to the complainant by sellers of those products was allegedly imported from Nepal.However, as per official documents, no such import is verifiable, hence, on the basis of this report of the investigator, the claim has been repudiated under clause 8 of the policy treating the claim as fraudulent claim.Thus, the main question in the present case arises whether the insurance claim would still be indemnifiable even if the material that was insured was properly procured but illegally imported (or not even imported) by suppliers.So far as the contract of insurance is concerned, the same is between the complainant/appellant and the insurance company and as per surveyor’s report, the conditions of this contract are mostly met.The surveyor has even relied upon the testimony of an agricultural scientist of renowned Ayurvedic company ‘Jhandu Pharmacy Ltd.’, to verify the insured products from ashes of the burnt material.Surveyor has also verified that the burnt material has been disposed of in his presence.Thus, the surveyor has assessed loss of Rs. 40,89,416/- and has recommended the same to the insurance company.Though, there was no such condition in the policy that the material will be imported from Nepal or somewhere else, however, supplier of the material have explained before the investigator that they had imported the material to be supplied to the complainant from Nepal.Then surveyor investigated the matter in India and in Nepal and found that no such material has been imported through the official channel of import and export.There is no entry of such import in Plant Quarantine Station of either Nepal or India and hence, investigator has reached to the conclusion that these materials were not actually imported and therefore, claim was a fraudulent claim under clause 8 of the policy.
12.    Now the legal question to be answered here is that if the material imported is not rightfully or legally imported, but its insurance and physical presence is verified by the surveyor, whether the claim can be indemnifiable or not.Before considering this question another aspect of this matter needs to be looked into.The insurance claim of the appellant/complainant was repudiated vide letter dated 26.04.2008 and complaint has been filed in the year 2013.First of all, the complaint has been filed after five years of repudiation of the claim i.e. after five years of the arising of the cause of action. However, apart from this, by that time, the complainant was definitely aware of the fact that complainant’s claim has been rejected by the insurance company on the ground that so called material supplied to the complainant was not legally imported or was not even imported and due to this fact, the claim was repudiated.Despite knowledge of this fact, the complainant has not made the suppliers of the products i.e. M/s. Yogini Products and Yogini Ayur Pharma, as a party in the complaint case, though they were necessary party in the context of the repudiation letter.If the complainant wanted to dispute the report of the investigator and the decision of the insurance company, the complainant should have produced evidence from the supplier in this regard.However, neither the suppliers were made a party in the complaint case nor their affidavits or other evidence from them have been produced by the complainant/appellant.Thus, in my view, the complaint itself suffered from the misjoinder of parties as well apart from having been filed after roughly five years from the date of cause of action.In these circumstances, presumption would be made that the complainant had no counter to offer against the report of the investigator and against the repudiation by the insurance company.
13.     Now coming to the issue as raised before, that if the material was either illegally or not even imported, but its physical presence has been verified by the surveyor of the insurance company, whether the insurance claim is to be admitted or not.I feel that in an insurance contract, if the subject matter of insurance is either illegally procured or purchased from an illegal source, then the contract becomes vitiated right from the very beginning because in any case, the law of the land is to be followed at every stage of the whole chain.As there is no evidence of import of the supplied material from Nepal, two possibilities arise.First, that the material was imported wrongfully and illegally through illegal means and supplied to the complainant and second that only forged entries were made in the register of the complainant and accordingly, documents were produced.In both these possibilities, the only legal presumption from the point of view of the insurance company would be that the claim is a fraudulent claim as if no material was there to be insured.Thus, the insurance company has rightly repudiated the claim under clause 8 of the insurance policy treating the claim as fraudulent claim.In taking this view, I am supported by the decision of this Commission in the case titled as M/s. Bharat Construction Vs. Divisional Manager in F.A. No 423 of 2010 decided on 29.06.2018 wherein the following has been observed:-
“12.   Xxxx. Hence, in these circumstances, clearly the vehicle was being run without any registration in contravention of Section 39 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988.  This is a fundamental violation of the Motor Vehicle Act and also a fundamental breach of the terms and conditions of the policy because the policy contract cannot be sustained if the provisions of any other relevant law have been violated because no contract would be valid if it contravenes any law of the land.”
14.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any merit in the appeal filed by the appellant and consequently, F.A. No. 120 of 2016 is dismissed.

4.     Later, OP nos. 1-2 assured the complainant that he may approach DHFL to get the financial assistance. Then the complainant went to DHFL and they issued a loan offer letter dated 13.07.2013.
5.     The appellants/ OP nos. 1-2 neither provided the letter of allotment nor the agreement was executed, however, when complainant demanded for the same, he was informed that his allotment stood cancelled vide letter dated 07.07.2013 which has been already sent to him. Demand letter along with the above letter was sent to the address 9/839, Sector 13, Vasundhra Ghaziabad whereas the address of the complainant as mentioned in the booking was 9/620, Vasundhra Ghaziabad.
6.     Complainant no.1 felt cheated and applied for refund for his deposited amount along with interest on 10.03.2015 which was denied by OP nos. 1-2, thereafter complainant no.1 sent letter dated 14.03.2015 claiming possession of the allotted flat and interest on the deposited amount, but no effort was made by the OP nos.1-2 to redress the grievance of the complainant.
7.     Complainants filed the complaint and prayed to direct OP nos.1-2 to provide physical possession of the allotted flat or in alternative to provide similar flat in the vicinity in the same scheme, to quash the illegal interest, to pay Rs.8.00 lakh as compensation and to pay 24% interest on the deposited amount.
8.     Learned counsel of the complainant has made this prayer during the course of argument before the State Commission that since OPs are not carrying out any construction at the site and booking of the flat was made at least about 5 years before, OPs be directed to refund the deposited amount along with interest.
9.     The State Commission vide its order dated 18.03.2016 has partially allowed the complaint with cost of Rs.10,000/- and directed OP nos.1-2 to refund the amount deposited along with 18% p.a. interest.
10.   Hence, OP nos.1-2 has filed an appeal against the above order.
11.    Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The allotment of the complainant was finally cancelled as the complainant did not deposit the balance instalments despite several reminders. It was also stated that the flat was booked for commercial purpose and the complainant is not a consumer of the appellant as neither the allotment letter has been issued nor the builder-buyer agreement has been executed. It was further argued that the complainant had sought physical possession of the flat and not refund of the paid amount. However the State Commission has ordered for refund of the paid amount along with 18% per annum interest. A prayer that was not sought by the complainant cannot be accepted by a consumer forum. It was also stated that the interest awarded is @18% per annum which is highly excessive. This Commission as well as the Hon’ble Supreme Court are not awarding 18% interest on refund these days. The refund is being allowed @ 9% - 10% per annum interest.
12.   On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent nos.1 and 2/ complainant nos.1 and 2 stated that when the booking of the flat was made by the complainant it was the duty of the opposite party to have issued an allotment letter. However, in spite of several requests, the OPs did not issue any allotment letter and insisted for further payment. When sizeable part of the consideration was paid to the opposite party, the complainant requested the opposite party nos.1- 2 to execute the builder-buyer agreement, however, the same was not sent to the complainant for execution. Providing no allotment letter and non-execution of the builder buyer agreement are clearly deficiency in service on the part of the OPs. Thus, it cannot be said that the complainant is not a consumer because, there is no allotment letter and there is no builder buyer agreement. The complainant has paid the amount of Rs.4,40,293/- to OP nos.1 – 2 and therefore, the complainant is a consumer of appellant/ OP nos.1-2. OP No. 4 refused loan to the complainant stating that the scheme was not approved by OP no.3. Later on when another financial institution DHFL agreed to provide the loan to the complainant on 13.07.2013, by that time, the OP nos.1 – 2 had already cancelled the booking on 07.07.2013. Thus, the State Commission has rightly allowed the refund of the amount with interest as there was no progress in the construction of the project even after five years of booking.
13.   I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the sides and have examined the record. Clearly, there is no basis for cancellation of the booking of the complainant, as the complainant pursued the loan from OP no.4 and later on with DHFL. Clearly, there is no substance in the argument of the appellant that the complainant is not a consumer of the appellant, because there is no allotment letter and no builder buyer agreement. It was the responsibility of the appellant to have issued the allotment letter after booking was made by the complainant, however, the same was not issued by the OPs. As there was no allotment letter issued and the money paid only remains as booking amount, the complainants are entitled to refund of the same. So far as the question of refund is concerned, it is true that the complaint was filed for possession of the flat. However, at the end of the prayer in the complaint, the following has been mentioned at item no. xi:
“any other order which this Hon’ ble State Commission deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the case may also be passed”.
14.   From the above, it is clear that the State Commission was competent to pass any other order in the light of the request of the complainant and it passed an order of refund. Otherwise also, in interest of justice and for providing better protection to the consumer, the consumer forum is competent to pass any appropriate order.
15.   Thus, I do not find any illegality in the order passed by the State Commission refunding the paid amount. The only question that can be considered is in respect of rate of interest awarded by the State Commission. The State Commission has awarded 18% per annum interest which is definitely highly excessive. Keeping in view the existing interest scenario, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd., vs Devasis Rudra – Civil Appeal no.3182 of 2019 – 2019 SCC online SC 438 decided on 25.03.2019, has reduced the interest @ 12% per annum awarded by this Commission to 9% per annum. However, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, I deem it appropriate to allow interest @ 10% per annum on the amount of refund.
16.   Based on the above discussion, FA no. 344 of 2016 is partly allowed and the order of the State Commission dated 18.03.2016 is modified to the extent that the amount will be refunded along with interest @ 10% per annum instead of 18% per annum as awarded by the State Commission from the date of respective deposits till actual payment. With this modification, the order of the State Commission is upheld.

  For the Respondent      :
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Post and Telegraph Department & Anr. against the order dated 20.02.2017 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Rajasthan  (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in FA No.117/2016.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant sent speed post on 15.12.2010 and it was promised to be delivered on next date, however, the same was delivered on 20.12.2010.  The speed post contained notice to the Municipal Commissioner, Jaipur. The complainant, therefore, filed a consumer complaint before the District Forum being Complaint No.521/2013 (Old No.711/11)  and the District Forum vide its order dated 17.11.2015 directed the opposite party Postal Department to refund the speed post charges Rs.34/- along with compensation of Rs.20,000/- and cost of litigation Rs.11,000/-.  The opposite party preferred an appeal before the State Commission being FA No.117/2016.  The State Commission dismissed the appeal at the admission stage.
3.      Hence the present revision petition.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at the admission stage.  Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that this revision petition has been filed with delay of 37 days and the delay has occurred due to obtaining higher orders to file the revision petition.  The inter-departmental consultation has also contributed to this delay.  The delay is inadvertent and without any mala fide.  It was requested to condone the delay.
5.      On merits, learned counsel stated that as per Section 6 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 following is mentioned:-
“6.Exemption from liability for loss, misdelivery, delay or damage.- The [Government] shall not incur any liability by reason of the loss, misdelivery or delay of, or damage to, any postal article in course of transmission by post, except in so far as such liability may in express terms be undertaken by the [Central Government] as hereinafter provided; and no officer of the Post Office shall incur any liability by reason of any such loss, misdelivery, delay or damage, unless he has caused the same fraudulently or by his wilful act or default.”
6.      On the basis of the above, learned counsel argued that the consumer forum did not have any jurisdiction to order the compensation to the complainant.
7.      Learned counsel further informed that in the execution proceedings, all the amounts were deposited and the same have already been released to the respondent/complainant.
8.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner and examined the record.  So far as the question of delay of 37 days is concerned, delay is condoned on the ground mentioned in the application for condonation of delay.
9.      Now coming to the merits, it is seen that this Commission in RP No.2979 of 2017, Dr. Ravi Agarwal Vs. Speed Post, Rajasthan University & anr. and RP No. 3238 of 2017, Speed Post Rajasthan University  & anr. Vs. Ravi Aggarwal, decided on 13.02.2019 (NC) has observed the following:-
“15.      Moreover, Section 6 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 clearly states that the exemption provided under this Section is not applicable where the Central Government has undertaken such liability in express terms.  In the scheme of speed post, the Central Government has undertaken the liability of delivery of the speed post article within a certain period of time and has also taken the liability of refund of the speed post charges if item is not delivered or misdelivered or there is delay in delivery.  Hence, as per the provision contained in the Section itself, this Section does not seem to be applicable in the matters of deficiency in the delivery of speed post articles.
17.        In nut shell it can be said that the person who has sent the speed post is a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as he has paid the speed post charges for getting the services of the speed post delivery.  Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act provides that the remedies under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is an additional remedy available to a consumer.  As seen above, in the case of speed post, Section 6 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898 does not seem to be applicable, the remedy under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is not in derogation of any other law for the time being in force.  Hence, as observed by this Commission in Post Office, Hissar (Through Superintendent of Post Offices) Vs. Shri Dilwan Singh, (supra), the District Forum and State Commission are empowered to award compensation to the complainant.”
10.    It is further seen that the order of the District Forum has already been complied with by the petitioner/opposite party in the execution proceedings.  The respondent has also expired. Moreover, the amount involved in the case is only Rs.31,000/- and in the light of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Gurgaon Gramin Bank Vs. Khazani & Anr., IV (2012) CPJ 5 (SC), the petitioner department should have desisted from filing the present revision petition keeping in view the meagre amount.
","11.    In above circumstances and the legal position as explained above, I do not see any opportunity to interfere with the impugned order dated 20.02.2017 of the State Commission and consequently the Revision Petition No.2198 of 2017 is dismissed.

IA/19153/2019 (C/delay)
Heard. For the reasons stated in the application, the delay of 10 days in filing the appeal is condoned. The application stands disposed of.
FA/2303/2019
The complainant / appellant who is a practicing as an advocate applied to the respondent  for allotment of an office space and an office suite (virtual space) in a project which the respondent was to develop in Greater Noida and the said spacers were allotted to him. The said units were intended to be used by the complainant / appellant for his office. Separate agreements in respect of the aforesaid units were executed between the parties on 24.2.2012 and the case of the complainant / appellant is that the possession was to be delivered by April, 2016. The possession having not been delivered, the complainant / appellant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking refund of the amount which he had paid to the respondent alongwith compensation. The State Commission vide impugned order dated 11.9.2019 dismissed the consumer complaint  in limine without notice to the respondent primarily on the grounds that (i) two separate complaints ought to have been filed since two units were booked by the complainant and (ii) the complainant was not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the C.P. Act.
3.      The term ‘consumer’ has been defined in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, which to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of this petition means a person who buys goods or hires or avails services for consideration but does not include a person who obtains goods for resale or who purchases goods or avails services for any commercial purpose.  As per the explanation, inserted with effect from 15.3.2003, for the purpose of the above referred clause, commercial purpose does not include use of the goods or services exclusively for the purpose of the earning livelihood by means of self-employment.
4.      Recently a three-Members Bench of this Commission in RP No.2833 of 2018  Tosoh India Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly LILAC Medicare pvt. Ltd.) Vs. Ram Kumar & Ors. decided on 6.1.2020 had an occasion to examine the question involved in this appeal and interalia held as under:-
“(a)     Only a person engaged in large scale commercial activities for the purpose of making profit is not a consumer;
(c)     What is crucial for the purpose of determining whether a person is a ‘consumer’ or not is the purpose for which the goods were purchased or the services were hired or availed and not the scale of his commercial activities.
(d)    The explanation below Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act is clarificatory in nature.
(e)     A person purchasing goods or hiring or availing services for a consideration, for the purpose of earning his livelihood by way of self-employment is a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
(f)     It is not necessary that a person should be working alone in the commercial activity undertaken by him for earning his livelihood and his family members and / or a few employees can assist him in his commercial venture.  Such assistance by his family members or by a few employees engaged by him does not convert his business or profession into a commercial activity on a large scale, for the purpose of making profit and therefore, does not exclude him from the purview of the term ‘consumer’.”
5.      The complainant. as noted earlier, is an advocate by profession. He had specifically alleged in Para 1 of the consumer complaint that the premises were booked by her for being used as office. An advocate earn his livelihood by working in the premises which he either purchases or takes on rent/licence. Therefore, when an advocate claims that the said premises was intended to be used as his office, it can be safely construed to mean that he intended to earn his livelihood by way of self-employment since he would be working in the office which he purchases or takes on rent as the case may be. An advocate can also acquire more than one office spaces for the purpose of earning his livelihood, so long as he does not enlarge his professional activity to a commercial level. It would be difficult to say that  an advocate taking two different units for being used as his office necessarily acquires them for a commercial purpose. Whether the premises are acquired for a commercial purpose or not would depend upon several factors indicating the size of the premises, the number of advocates and staff members working with the advocate concerned and his total receipts from the professional activities. Mere acquisition of two commercial spaces would not justify inference of large-scale commercial activities by an advocate.
6.      In the present case, the office premises are not large, one of them measuring only 500 sq.ft. and the other measuring 300 sq.ft. which by itself does not justify inference of large-scale professional activities. In any case, the complainant needs to be given an opportunity to establish, by leading evidence during the hearing of the complaint, that despite he having booked two office places, he was not engaged in large-scale commercial activity and intended to use both the office spaces for the purpose of earning his livelihood by way of self-employment.
6.      As far as the second reason given by the State Commission for dismissing the complaint is concerned, the view taken by the State Commission cannot be upheld considering the order dated 9.4.2018 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal no.2610 of 2018 – Manisha Manjit Singh Vs. Pune Kondhwa Reality Pvt. Ltd. & Anr.
7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted back to the State Commission for proceeding with the consumer complaint in accordance with law.
","8.      The appellant/complainant shall appear before the State Commission on 24.2.2020. The appeal stands disposed of.

1.       This Revision Petition No.313 of 2015 challenges the order of State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, Chandigarh in F.A. No.1551 of 2012 and F.A. No.1556 of 2012.  The petitioner/appellants’ appeal had been disposed off by partly accepting F.A. No.1551 of 2012 and reducing the claim payable to the respondent/complainant from that awarded by the District Forum, from Rs.4,99,715/- to Rs.3,57,133/-, on non-standard basis.  The other appeal, F.A. No.1556 of 2012 filed by the respondent/complainant, seeking enhancement in the compensation, had been dismissed vide the impugned order of the State Commission.  In turn, the District Forum had accepted the complaint against the petitioner/OP1, setting aside the letter of repudiation of the claim and directing the petitioner/OP1 to pay Rs.4,99,715/-.  As such, this revision petition challenges the concurrent findings of the District Forum and the State Commission.
2.       Brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant (hereafter, ‘complainant’), owner of transit mixture Truck No.PB-03-T-9388, had the vehicle insured with the petitioner/OP1-United India Insurance Company Ltd. (hereafter, ‘OP1’), with effect from 9.3.2010 to 8.3.2011.  The IDV of the vehicle was Rs.17,50,000/-.  The said vehicle, while working on upgradation of Deodar to Nainawali road and link in District Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, met with an accident on the intervening night of 30/31.7.2010 at 1.30 a.m. The OP1 was intimated immediately and Mr. Sumit Goyal, surveyor was appointed for spot survey and the vehicle was removed with the help of recovery vehicle and shifted to Bathinda and thereafter to the authorized centre at Chandigarh.  All these movements involved expenditure by the complainant.  The vehicle was heavily damaged and an estimate of Rs.11,52,448/- was made for it’s repair.  Thereafter, the final surveyor was appointed by OP1 from Ludhiana.  Per the plaint, the final surveyor did not permit the complainant to start repair under supervision and so, compelled the complainant to hire another similar vehicle, at a cost of Rs.1,19,897/-.  As his claim was not allowed by OP1, vide repudiation letter dated 21.12.2011, a consumer complaint was filed with the District Forum.  As already stated, District Forum had allowed the complaint partly and the State Commission thereafter had reduced the quantum of compensation, vide the impugned order, and  directed that the claim be restricted to 75% of the total permissible amount, Rs. 4,76,177.34, on non-standard basis.
3.       Arguments were heard on 14.7.2020.
4.       Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the claim of the complainant had been declined by OP1 on the twin grounds that the vehicle did not have a route permit at the time of the accident and that this was a clear fundamental violation of the Motor Vehicles Act as well as the insurance policy terms and conditions.  He argued that both these aspects of law seemed to have been overlooked by the lower fora.  In support, the learned counsel invoked a few citations to support the argument that lack of route permit was a fundamental breach of the contract of insurance and that therefore OP1’s repudiation was fully justified.  In R.P. No.2600 of 2014, decided on 28.1.2015 by the National Commission, in the case of United India Ins. Co. Ltd. Vs. Kishore Sharma, as the vehicle was being plied as a taxi without valid permit, it had been held, in paras 18 to 24 thereof, that in view of the violation of the terms and conditions of the policy as also violation of the provisions of the M.V. Act, 1988, the petitioner was justified in repudiating the claim of the respondent/complainant.  In R.P. No.2476 of 2012 decided on 6.2.2014, in the matter of New India Ass. Co. Ltd. Vs. Birbal Singh Jhakhar, it was held, in paras 9 and 11, that the vehicle was being plied without a valid permit, in violation of limitation as to use clause of the policy, and this amounted to a fundamental breach of the insurance contract, and therefore, the petitioner insurance company was justified in repudiating the claim.  In R.P. No.3101 of 2013, vide decision dated 14.2.2014, New India Ass. Co. Ltd. vs. Rajesh Yadav, it was held that the insurance for a Haryana registered vehicle  without a valid permit which was stolen in Delhi could not be claimed even on non-standard basis. The Apex Court in its judgment dated 17.7.2018, in C.A. No.2253/2018, Amrit Paul Singh & anr. Vs. TATA AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd. & ors., had adjudicated a case which involved a vehicle which did not have a route permit on the date of the accident but which had been applied for and became available at a later date: the Apex Court had held that this would not help as there was no permit on the date of the accident and that this was a fundamental statutory infraction, dismissed the appeal.  The learned counsel concluded his arguments by essentially submitting that in the instant case, the vehicle did not possess route permit at the time of the accident, that this permit was obtained later by the complainant but that this could not help the case of the complainant. What was material was whether or not the vehicle had a valid route permit for operation in Haryana.  So, the fact that the vehicle had a permit in Punjab was of no avail to the complainant.  Learned counsel for the petitioner therefore basically argued that it was clear from the citations and the facts of the case that the lower fora had committed an error apparent and misinterpreted the law and that payment on non-standard basis as directed by the State Commission would amount to rewriting of the insurance contract.
5.       Counsel for the respondent/complainant confined his arguments to whether non possession of the route permit at the time of the accident was a fundamental breach of the insurance contract, and so fundamental that the repudiation was the only option left to the insurance company.  He argued that the allegation of fundamental breach of contract could not be sustained.  In the instant matter under consideration, it was not the case at all that the vehicle did not have a route permit; rather, it was the case that it did have a route permit for Punjab and that in the course of its work, it diverted to Yamuna Nagar, Haryana, and was engaged in work there when the accident happened.  It was further the case that as soon as the complainant became aware after the accident that the accident site was in Haryana and that a route permit in Haryana was also required, he immediately took steps to obtain a temporary permit, and this temporary permit was granted by the Haryana Government and was made effective from 01.07.2010 to 30.09.2010.  As such, it cannot be said that the vehicle did not have a route permit on the date of the accident, even though it may have been obtained subsequent to the accident.  This would make it clear that there was no intention of the complainant to be without a route permit; rather, it was an inadvertent error and the moment it was realized, remedial steps followed immediately. Thus, the complainant’s conduct would show clearly that the non-possession of route permit was at best an irregularity,  and certainly not a fundamental breach.  Further, he argued that it was nobody’s case that the fact of there being no route permit had any nexus with the accident that took place.
6.       In support the learned counsel for the complainant invoked some citations.
7.       In R.P. No.1870 of 2015, decided by this Commission on 14.8.2018, in the matter of New India Ass. Co. Ltd. Vs. Thirath Singh Brar, the Commission upheld the concurrent findings of the lower fora favouring the complainant, holding that the twin facts viz. the vehicle was not being put to commercial use ( as specifically pleaded by the complainant) and that there was no nexus of the damage caused to the vehicle with the factum of non-possession of the route permit, and modified the order of compensation to settlement on non-standard basis, relying upon the Hon’ble Apex Court’s judgement in the case of Amlendu Sahu vs Oriental Insurance Co. ltd. (2010) 4 SCC 536. In R.P. No.1739 of 2017, National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Narender Gupta, the Commission decided vide judgment dated 27.7.2017 that repudiation of the claim was not proper simply because the route permit expired on 28.6.2014 while the accident had taken place on 16.7.2014 which had been subsequently renewed with retrospective effect.  In 2013 ACJ 1213, the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, in a matter in which the insurance claim had been repudiated because the vehicle had permit for Rajasthan but not for Haryana, it was held that since the transport authority of the Rajasthan had found the vehicle fit for being run as a goods carriage, it could not be said that the vehicle was plied without a route permit.  The violation of bringing the vehicle to Haryana without a valid route permit for plying the same in that state would not amount to violation of the conditions of the insurance policy.  The court had also remarked that the case before it was not a case of where there was no route permit at all.
8.       After hearing the learned counsels, carefully perusing the record including citations furnished, I am of the view that this revision petition cannot sustain.
9.       Admittedly, the vehicle did not have a valid route permit for Haryana.  While OP1 has found in this a fundamental violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, as it is in violation of section 66 of the Motor Vehicles Act, and on that basis, has repudiated the claim entirely, the complainant’s case is that an inadvertent error on its part, without any intent, cannot be adjudged to be a fundamental breach.  I am inclined to agree with the complainant.
10.     There is a huge distinction between not having a route permit at all and having a route permit but not having the relevant route permit at a point of time.  Latter is the situation in the case at hand.  It is reasonable to say that the complainant, as soon as it became aware that it did not possess a route permit for the accident site, took immediate steps to rectify the situation.  Nothing greatly amiss was found in such conduct by the concerned Haryana authorities either as such a permit was granted with retrospective effect. This suggests that non-possession of a route permit was not an act of intent, with any malafide motive; indeed, it could not be as it is hard to imagine how the complainant would have gained by not having a route permit.  The very fact that the complainant had a route permit for Punjab, it was surely not a problem to have one for Haryana also. As argued by the counsel, the vehicle wandered into Haryana without realizing the fact, a reasonable proposition given the contiguity of the two states. The error in not having a route permit was admitted; that this was an error of such seriousness is hard to digest.
11.     There is also the fact that whether or not the vehicle had a route permit had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact of the accident and the damage caused thereby.  The insurance cover was taken for damage due to unforeseen events.  The accident was unforeseen and unexpected. No malafide on the part of the complainant with a view to gain pecuniary advantage from the insurance company has been alleged. The conduct of the complainant has not been called in question. In such circumstances, OP is bound to provide insurance cover and honour the cover, in the instant case involving what can at best be called a technical irregularity and not a fundamental breach.
","12.     In view of the discussion above, this revision petition, after consideration, stands dismissed.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Pravin Bahaduri, Mr. Priyash Sharma, 
Mr. Prabhat Ranjan, with Mr.Alabhya Dhamija, Advocates 
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      These appeals are directed against the order of the State Commission whereby the consumer complaints filed by the Appellants were disposed of with directions to the Respondent to deliver possession execute the sale deed in favour of the Complainants/ Appellants and pay compensation in terms of the said order to them.  While deciding the complaint the State Commission rejected the challenge by the Complainants to the additional demand raised by the Respondent on account of increase in the saleable area of the flats which the Complainants had booked with the Respondents.
2.      The Ld.Counsel for the Appellants/ Complainants states on instructions that in these appeals they are restricting their grievance to the alleged increase in the saleable area of the apartment. His submission is that the additional demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area of the apartment was made by the developer without providing requisite certificates evidencing the alleged increased in the saleable area of the apartment.  The Ld. Counsel for the Respondent submits that as per the agreements executed between the parties the saleable area of the independent floor for the purpose of the calculating the sale price of the independent floor subject matter of the agreement is the sum of the specific area of the said independent floor and its pro-rata interest in the common areas in the said building/ plot. The relevant clause in the agreement reads as under:
“Saleable Area for the purpose of calculating the sale price of Said Independent Floor, shall be the sum of the Specific Area of Said Independent Floor and its prorate interest in the Common areas in Said Building/ said plot.
Whereas the specific area of Said Independent Floor shall mean entire area enclosed by its periphery walls including area under walls, columns, verandahs/ balconies, cupboards and lofts etc. and half the area of common walls with adjoining Independent Floor which form integral part of Said Independent Floor and Common areas shall mean all such parts/ areas in Said Building which the Allottee of Said Independent Floor shall use by sharing with the other allottees/ occupants in Said Building/ said plot including entrance at ground floor, plumbing shafts, electrical shafts, lift shaft, if provided, staircase including area used for electric meter boxes, letter boxes & call bells, mumty, overhead water tanks and architectural features if provided.
It if further clarified that the Saleable Area mentioned in the Agreement is tentative and may undergo changes, the final Saleable Area shall be intimated upon completion of construction of the said building. Inclusion of common areas within or outside the said building for the purpose of calculating Saleable Area does not give any right, title or interest in common areas to the allottee except the right to use Common areas by sharing with the other allottees/ occupants in Said Building/ said plot.  The tentative percentage of specific area of Said Independent Floor to saleable area varies 87% to 92% approximately presently, depending on the size of the independent floor, which may under changes till completion of construction of the said building.”
The specific area of the independent floor thus has been defined in the agreement and so has been the common area in the said building/ plot.
3.      The Ld. Counsel for the developer also submits that the saleable area of each independent floor was got independently verified by the respondent from School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi and the final saleable area so determined by the School of Planning and Architecture is absolutely inconformity with the final super area of the independent floor conveyed by them to the allottees. It is also pointed out by the Ld. Counsel for the respondent that though the Complainants expressed grievance in respect to the increasing in the saleable area in most of the Consumer Complaints filed by them, in some of the matters no prayer in respect of the saleable area was made by them. It is pointed out by the Ld.Counsel for the Appellants that the directions for withdrawal of the additional demand which included the demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area was sought by the concerned Complainants in most of these matters.
4.      It was suggested to the Complainants/ Appellants that in order to give a quietus to the dispute, the report of School of Planning and Architecture can be taken on record and the Appellants can be given opportunity to file evidence in rebuttal, before this Commission itself.  But, the Ld. Counsel for the Appellants wants determination by the State Commission, on the basis of the evidence of both the parties.
","5.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of in terms of the following directions.
The matters are remitted back to the concerned State Commission for deciding whether there has been any increase in the saleable area of the independent floors allotted to the Complainants/ Appellants or not and if so to what extent the said saleable area has increased.
The Respondent shall be entitled to lead evidence in addition to the report of the School of Planning and Architecture if it so wants, to prove the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor.
The Appellants/ Complainants shall be entitled to lead evidence to prove that there has been no increase in the saleable area or that the increase was less than for which they were made to pay to the Respondent.
The State Commission shall pass fresh order limited to the grievance of the Complainants/ Appellants with respect to the additional demand due to the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor after giving opportunity to the parties to lead evidence in terms of this order.
The final order with respect to the grievance of the Complainants against additional demand on account of the alleged increase in the saleable area of the independent floor shall be passed by the State Commission at the earliest possible.
While passing appropriate fresh orders the State Commission shall, inter alia, consider the prayers made in the Consumer Complaints.
No order as to costs.

","1.       The present Revision Petition has been filed under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) by L.B.S. Group of Education Institute (Opposite Party No.1 in the Complaint), challenging the Order dated 19.12.2019, passed by the Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Bench No.1 at Jaipur (herein after referred to as ‘State Commission’), whereby First Appeal No. 1275 of 2019, preferred by Construction Industry Development Council (Opposite Party No.2 in the Complaint) has been dismissed, upholding the Order dated 31.10.2019, passed by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Kota, Rajasthan (hereinafter referred to as the District Forum) in Complaint Case No. 268 of 2016.  By the said Order, while allowing the Complaint, preferred by the Complainant, Respondent No.1 herein, the District Forum had held the Complainant eligible to get his Electrical Engineering Diploma of 3 year course of duration 2011-2014 and consequently directed Opposite Parties, including the Petitioner herein, to jointly and severally pay a total amount of Rs.1,05,000/- towards compensation for mental displeasure, economic loss and costs, within one month, failing which simple interest @ 9% was awarded on the said amount.  In addition, it was also directed by the District Forum that if the Diploma Certificate/Degree is not issued to the Complainant within one month, then from the date of its decision, i.e. 31.10.2019, the Opposite Parties would pay a sum of Rs.1000/- per month till the date of actual delivery to the Complainant.
2.       Briefly stated, that the facts giving rise to the present Petition are as follows:
According to the Complainant, pursuant to a notice circulated by Assam University (Opposite Party No.1) and on being selected by Construction Industry Development Council (Opposite Party No.2) and the Petitioner herein (Opposite Party No.3), under the direction of Opposite Party No.1, and on the assurance of getting Diploma Engineering Course in different Branches, vide Enrolment No. 1131010786, the Complainant deposited fees with the Petitioner Institute and took admission in the Polytechnic Diploma Branch Electrical Course in the year 2011.  On completion of the Course, Result-cum-Mark Sheet and Provisional Diploma Certificate was issued to the Complainant on 31.01.2015.  However, even after depositing the entire fees, the Degree of the Diploma Course was not issued to the Complainant.  The Complainant also made several requests in this behalf but all in vain.  On account of non-issuance of the Degree, the Complainant was not able to apply for job in government, semi-government and private organizations, which caused him mental agony and financial loss.  Alleging deficiency in service on the part of the Opposite Parties, including the Petitioner herein, on the aforesaid counts, the Complainant filed the Complaint before the District Forum.
3.       Upon notice, while Opposite Parties No.1 and 2 filed their respective Written Version before the District Forum, the Petitioner herein (Opposite Party No.3) did not do so.  Opposite Parties No. 1 and 2 denied the allegations levelled by the Complainant and prayed for dismissal of the Complaint.
4.       On appreciation of the Evidence adduced before it, the District Forum vide Order dated 31.10.2019 allowed the Complaint and issued the afore-stated directions to the Opposite Parties, including the Petitioner herein.
5.       Feeling aggrieved by the Order dated 31.10.2019 passed by the District Forum, Construction Industry Development Council (Opposite Party No.2) filed the afore-noted Appeal before the State Commission.  However, the State Commission vide Order dated 19.12.2019 dismissed the Appeal, upholding the Order dated 31.10.2019, passed by the District Forum.
6.       Feeling aggrieved with the Order dated 19.12.2019 passed by the State Commission, the Petitioner (Opposite Party No.3) has come up in Revision before this Commission.
7.       We have heard learned Counsels for the Parties and perused the documents placed on record.  In our considered view, a Preliminary Issue as to whether Educational Institutions providing Education and other Incidental Activities to the students come within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 or not arises in this case and the said issue is squarely covered by the decision of a Larger Bench of three Members of this Commission in the case of Manu Solanki and Others Vs. Vinayak Mission University and other connected cases, 1(2020) CPJ, 2010, wherein the Larger Bench has held that Educational matters do not come within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and, therefore, the Complaint is not maintainable. Relevant portion of the Order is reproduced below for ready reference :-
“37.    The following legal issues arise from the submissions made by the rival parties and the  aforenoted decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court:
Would any defects/ deficiency/ unfair trade practice indulged by the Educational Institutions post admission, which does not fall within the ‘course of imparting knowledge’ till the degree is conferred, falls within the ambit of the definition of Education?
If we apply the definition of Education, imparting knowledge for full potential, will that criterion apply to the admission stage, when the foundation for admission itself is deficient?
Would preferential activities for extracurricular activities, which do not have a direct nexus with admission fees, syllabus etc. be defined as Core Education? For Example if students go for a picnic and a mishap happens, does it fall within the definition of deficiency of service and is it part of Core Education? Do educational tours fall within the ambit of the definition of ‘Education’.
Another example, if a school has a swimming pool and students of that institution drown on account of some deficiency or negligence of the authorities, would swimming in the school campus fall within the ambit of Core Education? Does maintaining a swimming pool and teaching swimming be considered as a part of Core Education?
Does defect/ deficiency in service of any boarding/ hostel facilities rendered fall within the umbrella of ‘Education’?
Do coaching centers/ institutions fall within the ambit of the Definitionof ‘Educational Institutions’.
Do institutions involved in vocational training like, nursing, designing etc. strictly fall within the definition of ‘Educational Institutions’.
38.     Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners in Revision Petition Nos. 2955 to 2963 of 2018 submitted that once the University is declared as ‘Deemed University’ all functions and activities governed by the University Grants Commission Act (UGC Act), fall within the definition of ‘Authority’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and would be amenable only to the jurisdiction of the High Court. It is contended that even if the Education Institutions do not have a proper affiliation, Consumer Fora do not have jurisdiction to entertain the same. In our view even if an Institution imparting education does not have a proper affiliation in imparting education, it is not rendering any service and, therefore, will be out of the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
39.     Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in Revision Petition No. 222 of 2015 vehemently contended that the Complainant had taken admission in             B. Ed. course of the Opposite Party on the assurance that the said college  was recognized  by National Council of Technical Education (NCTE) and affiliated with the Opposite Party No. 2, Uttrakhand Technical University, who subsequently came to know that the Institute was not recognized by NCTE and therefore sought for refund of the fees. Whether such an unfair trade practice post admission would fall within the ambit of the Act needs to be seen. As the Institution is imparting education though it has been not recognized by the National Council of Technical Education, it would not make any difference because it will be covered under the education. Thus, the said Institute would not be rendering any service as defined in the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
40.     There may be instances where there may be defect/deficiency of service in pre-admission stages by an educational Institution but as the educational Institutions are not rendering any service by imparting education, these instances will also not give any right for a person to approach the Consumer Fora under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
41.     Learned Counsel for the Educational Institution in Revision Petition No.  1731 to 1733 of 2017 argued that imparting education in a school is not limited to teaching in a class room and involves within its ambit other co-curricular activities including taking out the students for educational trips etc., for their overall growth and development and improvement of their faculties.  In that matter, the children were taken by the Respondents for an “educational excursion trip” to a place of historical importance, and it was contended that, any shortcoming or negligence during the course of such an act falls within the definition of imparting education and therefore shall not fall within the domain of the Consumer Protection Act. 1986. Another issue which was raised is with respect to any defect or deficiency which may arise on account of a student drowning in a swimming pool maintained by the Educational Institution. We are of the considered opinion that such incidental activities of an Educational Institution while imparting education would also not amount to rendering any service under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
42.     Another relevant issue which was raised during the course of arguments was with respect to any defect or deficiency in the transportation which is provided by the schools/colleges.  School buses are vehicles hired by the Institutions and in most schools is made compulsory with, the prescribed fees including the cost of transportation.  Children come in their own vehicles also and we are of the view that any defect or deficiency in transporting the children to the school does fall within the definition of ‘imparting knowledge’ and, therefore, the Consumer Fora has no jurisdiction to entertain such Complaints arising out of these issues.
43.     Now we address ourselves to the submissions made by the Learned Counsels in Revision Petition No. 462 of 2013 with respect to Coaching Institutions. The question which arises here is whether the Coaching Institutions fall within the definition of “Educational Institution”.  Learned Counsel appearing for the Coaching Centres vehemently contended that though the Coaching Centres are not conventional Educational Institutions, since they are providing Coaching and training to students of an Educational nature same principles that apply to the Educational Institutions would also apply to these Institutions and that this view had been taken by this Commission in Fitjee Limited Vs. Minathi Rath I (2012) CPJ 194 NC.  In this case it has been held that Complainants were consumers who sought to avail services for consideration and that Fitjee is the provider of the services and that they are Consumer Disputes.  The issue that has been raised is that if the Coaching Centres were treated at par, as observed in this order, to be providing Coaching and training, to students of an Educational nature, then they too fall within the definition of ‘Education’ and, therefore, the services rendered by Coaching Centres cannot be construed to be ‘Service’ as defined under Section 2(1)(o) of the Act.
44.     Learned Counsel appearing for the Complainants submitted that there is no Regulatory Mechanism applicable to the Coaching Institutes.  He contended that Coaching Centres are promoting rote learning and not imparting actual knowledge.  He vehemently contended that they are running for a commercial purpose with a single aim of making profit and are expanding using the franchise route.
45.     We are of the considered view that conduction of Coaching Classes does not fall within the ambit of definition of ‘Education’ as defined by the Hon’ble Seven Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in P.A. Inamdar (Supra).    Coaching Centres cannot be equated to regular schools or colleges which are regulated by a Regulatory Authority and also confer a Degree/Diploma on the student who has passed in the examinations conducted as per the Rules and norms specified in the statute and also by the concerned Universities.  Therefore, strictly speaking Coaching Centres cannot fall within the definition of ‘Educational Institutions’.  We refrain from making any comments on the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Complainants with respect of Coaching Institutions indulging only in ‘rote learning’.
46.     For all the afore-noted reasons, we are of the opinion that any defect or deficiency or unfair trade practice pertaining to a service provider like ‘Coaching Centres’ does fall within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora.
47.     Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in Revision Petition Nos. 3383 and 3384 of 2018 submitted that student, who took admission in Multimedia Diploma and Certificate Courses in 3D Animation, Visual Effects, Video, Editing, Graphic Designing and Web Designing, though fall within the definition of Vocational training, the programs are recognized by Karnataka State Open University and withdrawal of any such program cannot fall within the jurisdiction of the Consumer Fora.
48.     At the outset, a broad definition of all that comprises ‘Vocational Courses’ needs to be seen. Generally speaking, there is a three tier system in HR Vocational Training program in India, which involve Certification level for 10+2 students, Diploma level Graduation program and Post-Graduation programs. For example vocational program include courses in areas of agriculture, automobiles, information technology, air conditioning, lab technician, live stock management, films and television, tourism etc. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in State of Punjab & Ors. Vs. Senior Vocational Staff Masters Association & Ors., 2017 (9) SCC 379, in para 22 observed that Vocational Courses are those Courses in which teaching is not on regular basis, though they play an important role in the grooming of students in the different fields. Vocational education can also be termed as job oriented education and trains young people for various jobs and helps them acquire specialize skills.
49.     The Union Cabinet has approved a merger of the existing  Regulatory Institutions in the skills space —  National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT) and the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) into the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET).
50.     The main purpose and objective of NCVET is to recognize and regulate and assess the skill related service regulators. It is clarified that even if there is any defect/deficiency/unfair trade practice in the services offered by private bodies in offering these courses and are not regulated and do not confer any Degree or Diploma recognized by any Approved Authority do fall within the ambit of definition of ‘Educational Institutions’ and hence the Consumer Fora have no jurisdiction to entertain the same.
51.     In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the Institutions rendering Education including Vocational courses and activities undertaken during the process of pre-admission as well as post-admission and also imparting excursion tours, picnics, extra co-curricular activities, swimming, sport, etc. except Coaching Institutions, will, therefore, not be covered under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.“
8.       Admittedly, L.B.S. Group of Education Institute, Petitioner herein, is rendering Education to all the persons, including the Complainant, and is not running a Coaching Institute.   Therefore, the law laid down by the Larger Bench of this Commission in the case of Manu Solanki (Supra), which we are bound to follow, is fully applicable and the Petitioner Institute does not fall within the purview of the Act as it is not rendering any services.
","9.       In view of the foregoing discussion, both the Orders passed by the State Commission and the District Forum cannot be sustained and are, therefore, set aside.  The Revision Petition is, accordingly, allowed and the Complaint is dismissed.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, the Parties shall bear their own costs.  However, it will be open to the Complainant to seek such remedies, which are available to him, in accordance with law.

ORDER
PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
The Complainant Vinod Khanna aged about 65 years (for short “the patient”) in second week of January, 2010 suffered pain in abdomen anddifficulty in passing urine. He was rushed to emergency department of Fortis Hospital at Vasant Kunj, New Delhi and after cauterization urine was removed.Thereafter, due to financial difficulties, for further treatment, he approached Dr. Anil Varshney (OP-2) at RG Stone Urology and Laparoscopy Hospital (OP-1 – for short “hospital”).The OP-2 examined the patient and advised surgery for to remove pus and also if required, removal of prostate. Ultrasonography (USG) study was performed and the patient underwent surgery on 13/01/2010. The OP-2 removed the pus and prostate.Total bill incurred by the patient was ₹1,04,725/- The patient was discharged on 15/01/2010 with catheter placed in the bladder for five days. On 18/01/2010 patient approached OP-1 hospital for the complaints that after surgery the he started passing urine from the rectum instead of his urethra.The OP-2 after examination informed the patient that the complication occurred and advised for natural healing, re-insertion of the catheter for further six weeks.Being worried, the Complainant approached Dr. Ajit Saxena at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital and he got admitted and took treatment from 19/01/2020 to 04/02/2010. Thereafter, was under follow-up atIndraprastha Apollo Hospital on 15/02/2010, 18/03/2010 and 23/03/2010.For his treatment incurred about ₹1,30,791/- expenditure at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. However, patient did not get complete cure. Thereafter, on 13/04/2010 patient reverted to Fortis Hospital at Vasant Kunj and discharged on 21/04/2010.He further incurred ₹1,15,640/- for the treatment. Thereafter, he was visiting regularly to the Fortis Hospital.
Being aggrieved by the negligent treatment at OP-1 the Complainant suffered injury and complications at the hand of OP-2, complainant filed the instant complaint before this Commission and prayed compensation of ₹1,88,37,602/-.
The OPs 1 and 2 resisted the complaint and denied the allegations. The OPs took preliminary objection of limitation as the instant complaint was filed in year 2018, i.e. after 8 years of cause of action which arose in year 2010. The OPs further submitted that the Complainant had prior surgery of hernia and appendix with history of tuberculosis and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV). It was submitted that prior to visit to OP-1 Hospital, he approached few renowned hospital in Delhi, but could not get the treatment. At OP-1 repeat USG confirmed the diagnosis as grade III benign enlargement of prostate (BEP) with multiple abscess cavities and some of them found fluctuating and communicating to posterior side of nodules which might be due to immuno-compromised status of the patient.
On 13/01/2010, the patient was admitted for the planned surgery for prostatic abscess de-roofing. He was known case of HIV positive, cryptococcal meningitis, Kaposi’s sarcoma and tuberculosis. The surgery was uneventful, lasted for about an hour. As a standard procedure OP-2 did per rectal examination and needle was put in the cavity, but no pus came out. Cystoscopy was done and urethra was found normal.De-roofing of the prostrate was done and the Foley’s catheter placed. All required post-operative due care was taken.The patient was discharged on 15/01/2010 and called for follow up on 18/01/2010.
On 18/01/2010, on removal of Foley’s catheter, it was noted that the patient passing urine through rectum which was a rare complication. The patient was properly explained and counseled about such known rare complication. It was unavoidable because of the fistula with multiple cavities communicating to the posterior side.It was due to the necrosis of rectal wall due to the existing abscess cavity which facilitated urine passages communicating with rectum.Majority of fistulae heal on its own over a period of time and the healing depends upon patient’s immunity. In the instant case the patient was severely immunocompromised, the recovery was bound to be slow. Such patients could be treated by further procedure for diversion of urine and faeces by suprapubic cystotomy and colostomy.Till then, the patient was re-catheterized to facilitate urinary passage and call for review after two weeks. However, the patient abandoned the treatment of OP-1 and the very next day i.e on 19/01/2010 went to Apollo Hospital.
Both the parties have filed their respective affidavits of evidence. Heard the arguments from both the sides. Perused the material on record.
We have perused the application for condonation of delay filed by the complainant. Initially on 13.07.2010 the Complainant filed a complaint before the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi (for short the ‘State Commission’) with the allegations that he is still urinating from rectum. The complaint was disposed of by State Commission on 16.08.2017 on the ground of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction. We note the time of seven years was elapsed before the state commission and the instant complaint was filed before this commission on 15.02.2018. Considering the factual position in our considered view the cause of action was continuous, therefore this present complaint is maintainable before this commission, and the delay is condoned.
We further note that, the patient suppressed in the pleadings that he was cured after surgery with medicines within six weeks of the discharge from OP-1, RG Stone. The medical record of Fortis Hospital, on 02/08/2010 it was recorded that“No urine per rectally, Fistula healed”.
The contention of the complaint of the Complainant about the penetration of the needle through the common wall of the rectum and urinary bladder has facilitated a way to urine to make a passage through rectum. We do not agree with the submission, as per medical literature the injection pricks does not cause fistulae or grave injury. Commonly to drain prostatic abscess trans rectal needle aspiration is used.
We took reference from the standard books on Surgery, Urogentital Pathology. The Prostatic abscessis a rare clinical entity. The safety and efficacy of trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided aspiration of prostatic abscess (PA) is known.Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) is considered to be a sensitive tool from a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint. The variety of therapeutic options available for managing Prostatic abscess includes drainage either using the trans-rectal, trans-urethral, or trans-perineal route under TRUS guidance.
The sequelae of Prostatic abscess are spontaneous rupture of abscess into the urethra, perineum, bladder, or rectum, chronic prostatitis, etc. A variety of organisms are responsible for its causation, which include gram-negative bacilli Esh.coli and the Staphylococci.
Needle aspiration is a viable treatment option for deeply seated body abscesses, which could be used by different approaches. In urological practice, needle aspiration has been used to treat renal, peri renal and pelvic abscesses. Unlike de-roofing, the endpoint of TRUS-guided aspiration of a prostatic abscess is controlled by simultaneous US. Despite that drainage might be more complete with deroofing, the multiplicity of abscesses in a large prostate can be a limitation to the deroofing procedure
We have perused the report (opinion) ofthe medical board constitutedthree independent doctors at Maulana Azad Hospital, New Delhinamely (1) Dr. R.K Jindal, Director Professor (Surgery) as Chairman, (2) Dr. M.K Daga, Director Professor (Medicines) and (3) Dr. Anubhav Vindal, Associate Prof (Surgery) as members.The board examined the medical records of the case in detail and had not found any negligence in this matter.
We have perused the consent form and found that the deroofing surgery performed by OP-2 was after taking due informed consent. The medical record of Apollo Hospital (page 26) and Fortis Hospital (page 38) clearly mentioned that the fistula healed by conservative management with medicines for six weeks only. According to Dr. Ajit Saxena of Apollo Hospital, he prescribed the patient to take tablet Tropan 2.5 mg BD for four weeks.  From 19/01/2010 the rectal leakage was found to have reduced to 10% on 05/02/2010 i.e within 15 days.  As per the medical record of Apollo Hospital, on 18/03/2010 there was no rectal leakage.  Thus, within six weeks the problem of Complainant was over by medicines only.  According to the surgical notes of Dr. Nalin Nag of Apollo Hospital, it was mentioned that fistula closed spontaneously.  Thereafter, patient approached Fortis Hospital on 14/07/2010 wherein nothing was mentioned about evidence of recto-urethral fistula. Thus, the 1st complaint filed before the State Commission was on false ground and wrong premise.
On the basis of the entire medical record, the affidavits of the OPs -1 & 2 and the expert opinion of the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, we do not find any deficiency in service or medical negligence in this case.
However, we cannot ignore the peculiarity of the ‘informed consent’ in the instant case which needs prompt and proper rectification. It is pertinent to note that it is a pre-printed form- ‘informed consent cum undertaking’ having blank spaces for limited selective handwritten entries and for the signatures. The main body of the form is fixed pre-printed.Such consent form fits into any procedure, any doctor, and any patient. Thus, it will take shape of informed consent if someone after filling up the blank spaces in handwriting and affixing the signatures of the patient and his sister as witness. This to be administrative arbitrariness and one-sided high handedness, and to be unfair and deceptive, on the part of the OP-1 (hospital); though the complainant has not been prejudiced in this particular case.
In the instant case, the Complainant/patient was suffering from HIV and skin cancer, he is fully aware about his immune-compromised status. Despite such HIV positive status, the OP-2operated the patient with all due care and reasonable skill.However, the Complainant with his ill intention published a story against the hospital in the ‘Hindustan Times’ to influence the court. Thereafter, the hospital explaining the real facts, the Hindustan Times published the rejoinder and also sought apology from the hospital. Thus, the Complainant was trying to coerce the hospital and influence emotionally for out of court settlement.
Considering the entirety, it is clear that the allegations of complainant are completely after thought based on assumptions, surmises and perverse beliefs. The Complainant/patient was treated as per the standard norms. The complainant failed to establish the breach of duty of treating doctor - OP-2 and resultant injury was the proximate cause from the breach. We do not find any deficiency in service / medical negligence on the part of the doctor (OP-2) and the hospital (OP-1). The complaint is frivolous, bereft of merit and ill-conceived.
With reference to our observations (supra) on the‘informed consent’ (para 14), we but determine the uniform use of this pre-printed and fixed ‘informed consent cum undertaking’ form on the part of the OP-1 (hospital) to be unfair trade practice within the meaning of section 2(1)(r) of the Act 1986 and deem it just and appropriate to impose a cost of Rs. 10 lakh on the OP-1 (hospital), to be deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Account of this Commission within four weeks of the pronouncement of the reasoned judgement, and to direct the OP-1 (hospital) to discontinue its said unfair trade practice with immediate effect.
","The Complaint is dismissed with the above direction to the hospital.
Per Hon’ble Dr. S.M. Kantikar and Hon’ble Mr. Dinesh Singh
We summarize as follows:
[a]     On the basis of the entire medical record and the evidence on file including inter alia the expert opinion of the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, we do not find any deficiency in service / medical negligence / unfair trade practice on the part of the opposite party no. 2 (doctor).
[b]     In respect of ‘consent’, in this particular case, having regard to the signatures of the patient and his sister as witness on the ‘informed consent cum undertaking’, the entire medical record, the affidavit of the opposite party no. 2 (doctor), the affidavit of the opposite party no. 1 (hospital) and the expert opinion of the medical board of Maulana Azad Medical College, we find it to be ‘informed consent’.
[c]     We do not find any deficiency in service / medical negligence on the part of the opposite party no. 1 (hospital).
[d]     We but note that a pre-printed and fixed ‘informed consent cum undertaking’ form, with blank spaces for limited select handwritten entries and for the signatures has been used. The main body of the form is pre-printed and fixed.  It can fit into any procedure, any doctor, and any patient, after filling up the blank spaces for the limited select handwritten entries and getting / affixing the signatures. We note this to be administrative arbitrariness and one-sided high handedness, and to be unfair and deceptive, on the part of the opposite party no. 1 (hospital), for which, though, the complainant has not been prejudiced in this particular case.
[e]     The complaint, in this particular case, is dismissed.
[f]      We but determine the uniform use of this pre-printed and fixed ‘informed consent cum undertaking’ form on the part of the opposite party no. 1 (hospital) to be unfair trade practice within the meaning of section 2(1)(r) of the Act 1986 and deem it just and appropriate to impose a cost of Rs. 10 lakh on the opposite party no. 1 (hospital), to be deposited with the Consumer Legal Aid Account of this Commission within four weeks of the pronouncement of the reasoned judgement, and to direct the opposite party no. 1 (hospital) to discontinue its said unfair trade practice with immediate effect.

  For the Petitioner     :MR. PRAMIT SAXENA 
  For the Respondent      :Mr.A.K.Patil, In person 
","1.      The present revision petition has been filed challenging the order dated 5.2.2016 of the State Commission in appeal No.455 of 2014.
2.      The present revision petition has been filed with a delay of 133 days and, therefore, an application for condonation of delay being IA No.10641 of 2016 has been filed alongwith the revision petition.
3.      Arguments of the parties on this application have been heard.
-2-
IA No.10641 of 2016 (condonation of delay)
1.      It is argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that delay had occurred due to the fact that the petitioner, being a company, had its regional and district offices at different places and its legal department is situated at its registered office at Akola.  It is submitted that the impugned order was passed at Aurangabad and the copy after it being received at Aurangabad regional office was forwarded to Jalgaon regional office and then to Head-Office.  The matter was evaluated by the concerned officers and the opinion was sought by the legal department.  The proposal was put forth with the management for the purpose of filing the revision petition.  The concerned personnel was transferred from the regional office and it being a peak season for the seeds, it further led to delay in approaching the counsel for filing the revision.  Briefing to the counsel at New Delhi was thereafter done and the copies of the relevant documents were supplied to him which took further time.  Since the pleadings and the documents were in Marathi Language, its translation to English also took further time.  It is submitted that all these factors collectively caused the delay in presenting the revision petition.  It is prayed that the delay be condoned.
-3-
2.      The complainant/respondent No.1 who is present in person has strongly opposed the said application and submitted that no reasonable grounds for condonation of delay has been shown by the petitioner company and the application be dismissed and the revision petition be also dismissed.
3.      I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments of the parties and perused the file.  It is a settled proposition of law that condonation of delay is not a matter of right.  Reasonable grounds are required to be shown for condoning the delay in filing the petition by the applicant.  This Commission, no doubt is vested with the discretion to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds but then it has to be within the four corners of law and has to be exercised by the Commission in appropriate cases and such delays should not be set aside merely on the ground that denial would cause inconvenience to a particular party.  The party is required to show the existence of sufficient cause for such delay.  These sufficient causes should be of such nature which prevented it from filing the revision petition/appeal within the period of limitation.  The parties are also required to show it had been acting diligently and remained active and the delay had occurred for the reasons
-4-
beyond its control.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of “Ram Lal and Ors. vs. Rewa Coalfields Limited, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 361” has held that condonation of delay is not a matter of right and the courts can exercise its discretion to condone the delay only where sufficient reasons are shown.  The Apex Court has held as under:
“12. It is, however, necessary to emphasize that even after sufficient cause has been shown a party is not entitled to the condonation of delay in question as a matter of right. The proof of a sufficient cause is a discretionary jurisdiction vested in the Court by S.5. If sufficient cause is not proved nothing further has to be done; the application for condonation has to be dismissed on that ground alone. If sufficient cause is shown then the Court has to enquire whether in its discretion it should condone the delay.
This aspect of the matter naturally introduces the consideration of all relevant facts and it is at this stage that diligence of the party or its bona fides may fall for consideration; but the scope of the enquiry while exercising the discretionary power after sufficient cause is shown would naturally be limited only to such facts as the Court may regard as relevant.”
4.       It is also settled preposition of law that delay of each and every day has to be explained.  The basic test to determine whether the delay is reasonable or whether the party has been acting with due diligence, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held in the case of “R. B. Ramlingam vs. R. B. Bhavaneshwari, I (2009) (2) CLJ (SC) 24” as under:
""5. We hold that in each and every case the Court has to examine whether delay in filing the special appeal leave petitions stands properly explained. This is the basic test which needs to be applied. The true guide is whether the petitioner has acted with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of his appeal/petition.”
5.       The Hon’ble Supreme Court has further cautioned this Commission and directed it to keep in mind the special nature of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 while dealing with application for condonation of delay.  In the case of “Anshul Aggarwal vs. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, (2011) 14 SCC 578,” the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“5.       It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Fora.""
6.      It is, therefore, a settled proposition of law that delay of each and every day has to be explained by showing sufficient reasons and grounds.  In the present case, the only reason seeking condonation of delay is that the delay had occurred due to administrative reasons.  The explanation given does not inspire any confidence and is not sufficient.  Such delays could have been avoided had the officials of the petitioner acted with due diligence and sincerely and mindful of the period of limitation.  It seems that the officials of the petitioner had acted with their own pace in a lethargic and un-mindful manner.  In the case of Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. –vs- Union of India (UOI) AIR2019 SC 505, Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly held as under :
15….. “Administrative difficulties would not be a valid reason to condone a delay above and beyond the statutory prescribed period Under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.”
-6-
","7.      I find no ground to condone the delay.  The application is hereby dismissed.
8.      Consequent there upon, the present revision petition is also dismissed being barred by limitation.
9.      It is submitted by the complainant/respondent that the petitioner had deposited the decretal amount with the District Forum pursuant to the directions of this Commission. The same may be ordered to be released to him.  Learned counsel for the petitioner on instructions says that petitioner has no objection if the deposited amount be released to the complainant.  In view of these submissions, the District Forum is directed to release the decretal amount in favour of the complainant/respondent within two weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order or on the application of the complainant.  Complainant is also free to file execution application in case any balance amount.
With these directions, the revision petition stands dismissed.

2.      These Appeals (04 nos.) have been filed under Section 19 of the Act 1986 against the Orders (04 nos.) dated 22.11.2018 of the State Commission, whereby, in C.C.s No. 1076 of 2017, No. 1077 of 2017, No. 1078 of 2017 and No. 1079 of 2017, under adjudication before the State Commission, the right of the Complainants to file evidence has been closed.
3.

4.

","Anup K. Thakur
1.      It is proposed to dispose off R.P. Nos.4782 and 4783, both of 2013, vide a common order.  Both these revision petitions arise out of the same order of the District Forum in C.C. No.996 of 2010 vide which the consumer complaint filed by the petitioner/complainant had been partly allowed, directing the respondents/OPs to refund Rs.20,603/- with interest @ 12 % from 9.4.2009 till the date of payment, with cost of Rs.2,000/-.
2.      This order of the District Forum was challenged by both the complainant as well as the OPs.
3.      F.A. No.315 of 2012, filed by the OPs, was allowed vide State Commission’s order dated 28.12.2012,  and the District Forum’s order was set aside.  Against this order of the State Commission, the complainant has filed R.P. No.4782 of 2013.
4.      F.A. No.845 of 2012, filed by the complainant, seeking higher compensation, was dismissed by the State Commission vide order dated 22.3.2013, noting that the complainant had not challenged the order of the State Commission dated 28.12.2012 in F.A. No.315 of 2012, and therefore concluding that there was nothing more to be considered in the appeal.  Against this, the complainant has filed R.P. No.4783 of 2013 dated 17.12.2013.
5.      As such, both the revision petitions basically challenge the impugned order of the State Commission in F.A. No.315 of 2012 dated 28.12.2012 vide which the District Forum’s order had been dismissed and the OPs appeal had been sustained.  Both revision petitions have been filed by the complainant.
6.      The brief facts of the case are as follows.  The OP bank had taken over the complainant’s existing loan from LIC Housing Finance Ltd. on certain terms viz.  @ 7.25%, repayable in 262 EMIs at Rs.12,207/- p.m.. This was on 24.2.2004. The complainant, on examining the statement of account dated 19.3.2008 noticed that he was being charged higher interest, without any notice and without obtaining his consent.  So, the complainant issued a notice dated 21.3.2008 to the OPs seeking break up of figures. It is the case of the complainant that the OPs had obtained his signatures on standard format without explaining the terms and conditions to him and had ended up charging excess interest. On 12.6.2008, the complainant issued another notice to the OP demanding that his loan be foreclosed and the excess interest charged be refunded.  He received no reply. Further, per the complainant, when he examined his statement of account from 6.7.2007 to 5.7.2009, he found that EMIs of Rs.12,207/- comprised of Rs.166/- by way of principal and Rs.12,041/- by way of interest.  Now, he was apprised of a scheme during April 2009 by the OP and offered the option to switch over to this scheme, the benefit being that his interest would reduce from 13.75% to 9.75%. For this switch, he had paid Rs.20,603/-.  His plaint throughout the tenure of his loan is basically that OPs increased the interest payments by him on the loan whenever there was an increase in interest rate, without any notification and without obtaining his specific consent.  However, the same thing did not happen when there was a decrease in interest rate. This was unfair.  Further, when the complainant wanted to change to another bank which offered lower interest rate, the OPs demanded huge amount towards foreclosure.  Hence, the complainant filed a consumer complaint no.996 of 2010 before the District Forum, Hyderabad which, after due consideration, found some deficiency in service on the part of the OPs, and directed that the switch over fee of Rs.20,603/- be refunded with 12 % interest.
7.      Both the parties filed their respective appeals.  In the appeal filed by the OPs, the appeal succeeded and the order of the District Forum was set aside. In the appeal filed by the complainant, it was dismissed as infructuous as an order had already been passed in F.A. No.315 of 2012, and there was no revision petition against that order before the National Commission.
8.      It is against these two orders of the State Commission in F.A. No.315 of 2012 and F.A. No.845 of 2012, disposed of respectively vide orders dated 28.12.2012 and 22.3.2013 that the two revision petitions under consideration were filed.
9.      Matter was heard on 5.8.2020.
","10.    At the outset, it was pointed out and noted that both the revision petitions have been filed with delay and the application for condonation of delay had been noticed to the OPs and the same had not yet been considered by the Commission.  Heard arguments on the delay application.  Counsel for the OPs vehemently argued that a plain reading of the application for delay would reveal that all the reasons advanced are without any supporting evidence and of such nature as to be only within the knowledge of the complainant. He therefore argued that these revision petitions be dismissed forthwith. After considering the arguments and the reasons put forth in the application for delay, and keeping in view that much time has already elapsed since filing of the RPs in the commission, delay is condoned and the revision petitions admitted.
11.    Learned counsel for the petitioner began his arguments by submitting that the facts in RP 4782 and RP 4783, both of 2013, were the same and both were basically against the State Commission’s order which had dismissed the order of the District Forum.  He raised a preliminary point of order: OPs had been asked vide the National Commission’s order dated 19.7.2016 to submit an affidavit to explain what was ‘floating rate of interest’ and ‘adjustable rate of interest’ and as to how the switch over offer under consideration would be beneficial to the petitioner/complainant. After more than a year, this was filed by Mr. Mohammad Jaffrey, but  without any details as to his identity. The learned counsel further submitted that, as on date, there was no existing loan account of the petitioner with the OP bank.  Arguments are therefore about the injustice suffered by the complainant at the hands of the OP bank earlier.  He drew attention to agreement for loan of Rs.12,30,859/- with EMIs of Rs.12,607/- p.m.  He drew attention to schedule A  of para (B), (C) and (G) of the agreement to argue that a close look at these would show that the OPs had not been fair with the complainant and had ended up charging more interest than they could have.  He highlighted the fact that in 2007-08, there was a financial crunch and RBI had issued guidelines to all Banks to reduce the rate of interest.  He drew attention to receipt of OP of payment made by him of Rs.20,603/- on 09.04.09 which was a ‘switch fee’ taken by the OP bank.  His contention was that the OP was not entitled to have taken this ‘switch fee’.  He further referred to the “Amendatory Agreement” for the switch from the present interest rate scheme to Adjustable rate of interest and emphasized that the handwritten note thereon clearly showed that that the switch was from ‘floating’ to ‘floating’, and not from floating to fixed or something like that.  In fact, he argued that this clearly showed that there was no switch; that this amendatory agreement was effectively the same as before and yet a fee had been taken.  He then drew attention to the order of the State Commission, para 9 thereof, which was read out, to argue that it was clear that the agreements on record and other documents were not keenly appreciated by the State Commission. The State Commission had passed its order only on the ground that the complainant was not an uneducated and illiterate person and that he could not have signed the documents without knowing their intent and purpose. Since he did sign the amendatory agreement, he was bound by it and therefore estopped from agitating the issue. Summing up, the learned counsel made the following points:
(i) what the complainant was paying towards loan repayment in 2004 was no different from what he was paying in 2009; as such, it was not understood why and for what benefit the OP had taken a switch fee of Rs.20,603/-;
(ii) when RBI had issued guidelines for special rate of interest, the OP took the switch fee but that meant no benefit to the complainant;
(iii) the State Commission had only observed that the complainant should not have signed the agreement; it did not go into the details available in the documents such as the agreements between the complainant and the OP- bank.
12.    Learned counsel for the respondent/OP drew attention to the Amendatory Agreement, Instructions sheet, clause 3 therein, and explained that it clearly spelt out that the Amendatory Agreement was for switch from present rate of interest scheme to Floating Reference Rate or Fixed Rate. Referring to the hand written noting on the Instructions sheet which was referred to by the counsel for the complainant’s, he explained that it was the complainant’s instructions that had been noted by the bank official, and that it was therefore the OP’s case that he had himself opted for switch from the existing rate of interest scheme to the new scheme offered which offered a reduced rate of interest, 9.75% against the existing 13.25%. It is for this switch from the existing to the new scheme that the switch fee was charged. He argued that the main point was that everything was done as per the agreement(s) between the parties which, in turn, were as per RBI guidelines. Therefore, the State Commission was correct in having dismissed the District Forum’s order.  In particular, he drew attention to para 8 and para 9 of the State Commission’s order which has recorded that the complainant had himself opted to switch from the present interest scheme to the adjustable rate of interest scheme. The complainant’s submission that Rs. 20,603/- collected from him had been assured by the bank officials to be credited back to his account was without any supporting evidence. So, the complainant himself had done whatever he did and he cannot now find fault with the Op-bank. Indeed, he was stopped from doing so.
13.    After hearing arguments and perusing the record, I am inclined not to interfere with the impugned orders of the State Commission.
14.    The complainant has not been able to show how the OP bank had indulged in any unfair trade practice and had charged him higher rate of interest than that provided in the Agreement. It is an admitted position that the complainant’s existing loan from LIC Housing Finance Ltd. was taken over by the OP bank from 24.2.2004. Notably, this was at the complainant’s instance. It has not been stated anywhere as to why the complainant opted for the OP-Bank; whatever be the reason, it is self evident that the complainant must have found it to be advantageous in switching to the OP Bank. After this, however, it would appear that he was less than satisfied with the OP-Bank, and there is a mention in the complaint petition that he wanted to foreclose and switch to another Bank offering lower interest rate but could not do so because the OP-Bank wanted high foreclosure charges. It is quite clear therefore that the complainant knew his own interest quite well and was willing to consider change of Banks for his loans. The complainant was therefore a discerning consumer. It is also clear that he admittedly did not get the benefit he thought he would get from the OP-Bank, and hence, he filed a consumer complaint.
15.    The OP bank, on the other hand, has taken a clear defence in it’s statement that whatever was done in respect of the loan account was in terms of the two agreements between the complainant and the OP bank.  Indeed, OP Bank could not have done otherwise: it is bound by the Banking Act and Regulations and has to function under the guidelines of the RBI. The Agreements on record are not customized documents; rather, they are standard documents and would apply to all similarly situated customers. The OP-Bank has been able to show that the Amendatory Agreement had only executed what the complainant had himself desired by way of the hand written notes recorded by the concerned bank official on the body of the Amendatory Agreement (Ann. P-8, page 102). The State Commission had appreciated this point and had therefore set aside the order of the District Forum, resulting in dismissal of the complaint. After a careful perusal of the record, I am also of the considered view that nothing has been done in the transactions highlighted by the complainant that would show unfairness of the OP in handling of the complainant’s loan account. Admittedly, a floating interest rate regime was opted by the complainant in the first instance and again, when performing the switch to take advantage of lower interest rate. To have opted for the switch and thereafter to allege unfairness in the interest rate charged by the OP is hardly tenable. At least, apart from averring that when he checked his account statement, he found that interest rates had been increased on several occasions, and that he had to pay a switch fee which was promised to be credited back, there is no other allegation. As for the first allegation, the statement of account clearly shows a fluctuating rate of interest (7.25% to 13.75%) but then, the loan scheme was on floating interest rate basis; around April 2009, the complainant opted to switch and this did result in lower interest rate. As for the second, a switch fee was charged because the OP-Bank was providing a service. The complainant should not have opted for the switch. His averment that he was misled has not been backed by any evidence.
16.    In view of the discussion above, both these revision petitions are dismissed.  The impugned orders of the State Commission are accordingly upheld. No order as to costs.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
1.      The complainants/ respondents are farmers growing apple crop in District Uttarkashi of Uttarakhand.  The crop of the complainants was insured with the petitioner Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd.,  under a scheme framed by Government of India, which was also adopted by the State Governments.  Under the scheme, compensation in case of adverse weather incidence was payable in the farmers who were insured with the insurance company.
2.      The adverse incidence was the equivalent of the deviation between ‘Trigger Weather’ and ‘Actual Weather’ date recorded at a ‘Reference Weather Station’ during the specified time-period. In case of an adverse weather incidence for at least 5 days all the insured cultivators growing the notified crop in the reference units area were entitled to pay out the under scheme.
3.      The Government of Uttarakhand, while implementing the said scheme in the State, directed that though reference unit area will be treated as the basis to accept a risk and analyzing the compensation, if the estimates by reference weather stations are not available the estimates for those days by fixed Backup Weather Centres will be used.  It was further stipulated that it related figures of even the Backup Weather Stations are not available then the estimates for those days from nearby weather stations will be used with the consent of the horticulture department of Uttarakhand.
4.      The complainants who are covered under the insurance scheme of the petitioner company, lodged claims alleging excess rainfall in the area where apple crop was grown by them.  The claims having not being paid they approach the concerned District Forum by way of separate consumer complaints.
5.      The complaints were resisted by the petitioner company, which inter alia, stated in its reply that there was no excess rainfall at least for five rainy days during the covered period i.e. from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014.
6.      The District Forum relying upon the data obtained by the complainant from HARC (Himalaya Action Research Centre), which is situated air distance of 200 meters and road distance of only about 1.5 km allowed the consumer complaints.
7.      Being aggrieved from order the passed by the District Forum the petitioner company approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals. The said appeals having been dismissed the petitioner company is before this Commission.
8.      As noted earlier, the scheme framed by Government of India and implemented by Government of Uttarakhand envisaged pay out towards the compensation only if the adverse weather condition was recorded by the Reference Weather Station (RWS) of data for the relevant period was available from the RWS, the data from any other weather stations could not have been used for the purpose of claiming or making the payout.  Even the data from the Backup Weather Station could be used only in case the data for the relevant period was not available from the RWS.
9.      In the present cases the data from the RWS was actual available. A perusal of said data would show that during the period from 16.03.2014 to 30.04.2014 there was no excess rainfall for at least 5 days.  Therefore, relying upon the aforesaid data no compensation to the complainants became payable.
10.    The submission of the learned counsel for the complainant is that since the HARC is situated much nearer as compared to the RWS, the data provided by the HARC is bound to more reliable and should be used for the purpose of compensating the farmers particular when the object of the scheme is to compensate the farmers whose crops is affected on account of bad weather condition, including excess rainfall.  The submission, though attractive, cannot be accepted since it runs contrary to the specific terms of the insurance scheme under which the crop of the complainant was insured. The said scheme envisaged payout towards the compensation only if the data provided by RWS indicated excess rainfall, in case such a data was actually available for the relevant period.  The data of a weather station, other than the RWS cannot be used for claiming compensation in terms of the scheme even if the said weather station happens to be nearer then the RWS.
11.    This Commission is bound to decide the consumer complaint on the basis of the terms and condition of the insurance policy.  Since the said terms and conditions do not permit to use of data from a nearby weather station other than the RWS, unless neither the data from the RWS nor the data from Backup Weather Station is available, the fora below in my opinion could not have used of data of HARC for the purpose of compensating the complainants.
12.    In fact the issue involved in this petition is no more res integra in view of the decision of this Commission in Tirath Ram Thakur vs. Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. & Anr. Revision Petition No.3282-3283 of 2014 decided on 11.07.2017 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“14.    COMPENSATION (PAYOUT)
(I)      AIC shall be responsible for all Payouts arising out of “Adverse Weather Incidence” strictly in terms of the Scheme terms & conditions read with the relevant Premium & Payout tables.  However, this responsibility of AIC shall attach only when the ‘Risk has incepted’, that is, AIC has duly received the FULL PREMIUM, directly from the Insured his own part, AND ALSO the corresponding Premium Subsidy part from the Governments.
(II)     Pay-out shall arise ONLY in case of Adverse Weather Incidence.  Adverse Weather Incidence is equivalent to the deviation between “Trigger Weather” and “Actual Weather” Data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time-period.  Trigger Weather is a pre-defined Weather Parameter applicable to a Notified Crop in a notified Reference Unit Area.
In case of Adverse Weather Incidence (AWI), all the insured cultivators growing the Notified Crop in the Reference Unit Area shall be deemed to have suffered the same level of AWI and the same proportion of crop-loss, and become eligible for the same rate of Payouts.”                      (Emphasis added)
It is manifest from the highlighted portion of the Scheme, in para (II), that the Payout in case of Adverse Weather Incidence has to be determined on the basis of the data recorded at a “Reference Weather Station” during the specified time period.  On a pointed query, learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner candidly admits that insofar as the Complainant’s Orchard is concerned, the relevant “Reference Weather Station” was Naggar and not Bahang.  That being so, we are unable to read any material irregularity or illegality in the impugned order, wherein the compensation payable to the Complainant has been determined on the basis of the weather data recorded at the said “Reference Weather Station”.
We are also unable to agree with the learned Counsel that the afore-noted stipulation in the Scheme is unfair to the Agriculturists.  The vires of the terms and conditions of a public policy cannot be examined in a Complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”
13.    The decision of this Commission in Revision Petition No.1654/2016 in  Agriculture Insurance Co. of India Ltd. Vs. Badri Singh Bisht & Anr. decided on 24.10.2016 also deals with this issue and to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“2.  It would thus be seen that the scheme was to be implemented on area approach basis wherein reference unit areas were to be notified for the purpose of insurance of the crop.  The reference unit areas were ordinarily to cover a radius of about 25 kms in case of rainfall and 100 kms in case of other weather parameters such as frost, heat, relative humidity etc.  Reference Weather Stations were also designated under the scheme for the purpose of providing weather data applicable to the area covered by a concerned reference unit area, for the purpose of calculation of compensation.  It is also evident that the compensation was to be paid strictly in terms of the aforesaid scheme and the computation of the compensation was dependent upon the weather in the reference unit area as per the data provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The actual loss if any suffered by the farmers had no bearing on the quantum of compensation payable under the scheme, and in case of abnormal weather, uniform compensation was payable to all the farmers in the affected area irrespective of the extent of their loss.
7.      As noted earlier, the computation of compensation in terms of the scheme was to be made on the basis of the data of the adverse weather provided by the concerned Reference Weather Station.  The case of the petitioner is that Kashipur was the Reference Weather Station notified by the Government for Kotabag.  There is absolutely no evidence or even an allegation that a Reference Weather Station other than Kashipur had been notified by the State Commission for the area of Kotabag.  Therefore, there is reason to reject the case of the petitioner company that Kashmir was the concerned Reference Weather Station.  As far as Pantnagar is concerned, that was only a back-up station and the data at Pantnagar was to be considered only in the event of data not being available at Kashipur which was the designated Reference Weather Station for areas including Kotabag.  Therefore, the petitioner company was fully justified in computing the compensation on the basis of the data collected and provided by Kashipur Reference Weather Station.
8.      A perusal of the computation sheets filed by the petitioner company shows that the compensation was calculated as per the weather data provided by the Reference Weather Station at Kashipur.  Since the scheme envisaged payment of compensation computed solely on the basis of the data provided by the Reference Weather Station, the computation made and the compensation paid by the petitioner company to the complainants cannot be faulted with, even if the actual loss suffered by the complainant was substantially higher.  It can hardly be denied that the compensation paid to the complainants was very meagre and more or less nominal but, the scheme as framed by the Government, does not envisage payment of a higher compensation or a compensation based upon the actual loss suffered by the farmers.  Therefore, the direction for payment of compensation awarded by the District Forum cannot be sustained.”
14.    For the reasons stated above, the impugned orders cannot be sustained and same are hereby set aside.  The consumer complaints are consequently with no order as to costs.
15.    The amount which the petitioner company had deposited with this commission be refunded to it along with interest may have accrued on it.

PER DR. S. M. KANTIKAR, PRESIDING MEMBER
The present Revision Petition is against the impugned order dated 20.03.2013 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh (for short “State Commission” ) whereby the appeal was partly allowed while modifying the order of the of the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Kapurthala (for short “District Forum ”) to some extent.
2.      Brief facts relevant for the disposal of the case are that in the month of November- December , 2004  the complainant for construction of his house had purchased sixteen finished doors and ten 35 mm boards manufactured by Rubberwood India Pvt. Ltd. (OP-1) through Prabhakar Sanitarywares & Cement Stockiest (OP-3), who was the sub agent of Royco Industries (OP-2). He paid  Rs.1,20,699/-  It was alleged that the goods purchased were of inferior quality. Soon after installation, the products got shrunk and bended. In some, the wood had cracked and even the glued finger joints have come off and have become uneven. The goods turned out to be of inferior quality and one door of the bathroom has expanded.  OPs 2 and 3 were informed about the defective nature of wood but no avail.  The complainant had incurred a loss of Rs. 2,50,000/- on account of price of the goods and wages paid to the carpenter.  Being aggrieved, a complaint was filed in the District Forum to replace the goods by the OPs at their cost or to pay Rs. 1,20,699/- along with Rs. 75,000/- for the replacement of the defective goods and Rs. 50,000/- as compensation .
3.      The complaint was resisted by the OPs by filing their respective written versions. The OP-1 contended that the OP-3 was not the sub- dealer of the OP-1 co., but it was the sub – dealer of the OP 2. The complainant was at fault as all traditional carpentry practices were violated. It was admitted that its Executive Mr. Anil R. Pillai inspected the premise of the complainant and noted that the problems were due to wrong application of the products.  However, under promotional scheme, partial replacement was offered to the complainant. All other allegations were denied. Similar defense was put by OPs 2 and 3 that the loss incurred by the complainant was due to violation of traditional carpentry practice.
4.      The District Forum, after hearing both the parties and based on evidence, vide order dated 18.03.2008 partly allowed the complaint and passed the following order:
12.  Apropos grant of relief to the complainant as claim for replacement of goods or sum of Rs. 1,20,699/- as price of the goods alongwith Rs. 75000/- for labour charges of carpenters and damages for deficiency in its service , he has not been specific about number of defective finished rubber wood doors out of sixteen doors and out of ten 35mm boards  and also about labour charges of the carpenters on the carpentry works. On the other hand opposite parties have also not been specific about defective wooden material supplied to the complainant. Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of the case holding opposite parties guilty of supplying of defective wooden materials, we partly allow the complaint to the extent of 70% of the value of wooden materials of Rs. 1,20,699/- and further Rs. 30,000/- as labour charges with further damages and costs of Rs. 10,000/- payable by the opposite parties within a period of one month from the receipt of copy of this order.
5.      Being aggrieved by the abovesaid order of the District Forum, the OPs appealed in the State Commission. The State Commission vide order dated 20.03.2013 modified the order of the District Forum to some extent and upheld the order of the District Forum. It observed:
13. The respondent purchased wooden articles from appellant no. 3, who is sub dealer of appellant no. 2 and manufacturer is appellant no. 1. Respondent examined Sh. Rashpal Singh, who deposed through his affidavit Ex. A- 1 that he is an expert carpenter, having an experience of more than 15 years in the profession. He has done the carpentry work at the house of the respondent. The doors and other woods and boards manufactured by appellant no. 1 were used by him. He inspected the doors and other fixtures.
The wood has shrunk and has bended. In some places, wood has cracked and even the joints have come out. The furniture and other fixtures made from other wood and boards are in perfect condition. The doors were already finished and they only affixed them. Sh. Sarabjit Singh, through his affidavit Ex. A- 2 also deposed similarly, as he is also a carpenter. The respondent also got the doors and windows examined from M/s Anil Associates, Govt. Approved Engineers, Architects and Valuers, who gave the opinion vide certificate dated 24.02.2207 (to be read as 2007) Ex. A-11 that the doors and windows were not of high quality. The respondent wrote letters Ex. A-4 to Ex. A- 7 to appellant no. 1 to remove the defects at the earliest. Ex. A- 8 is the warranty certificate given on behalf of appellant no. 1 as per this certificate, appellant no. 1 gave warranty for lifelong against borer attack, failure of finger joints and edge glued joints on Rubberwoods used. In case of any defect, appellant no. 1 undertook to repair / replace the part free of cost. Vide Ex. A-9, appellant no. 1 informed informed the respondent that all the professional claims raised by M/s Royco Industries, Jalandhar, from whom they have purchased the produces, have been passed. Ex.A-3 is the advertisement of the product of appellant no. 1 Ex. A-11 is the certificate of Er R.C. Tondon vide which he gave the opinion that the rubber wood used in the doors and windows in the house is not of high quality and it is liable to early shrinkage and loosening of finger joints. Ex. A 12 and Ex. A- 13 are the photographs and Ex. A- 15 is the legal notice. Ex. A- 17 is the report of Local Commissioner.
14. To rebut this evidence , the appellants tendered the affidavit of Sh. Daljit Rai Ex. R-1, pamphlet of Singla Doors Ex. R-2, brochure of appellant no. 3 Ex. R-3, the Tips for the proper handling of Rubco Rubwood Ex. R-4 and brochure of Rubco Ex. R- 5. The appellants have not examined any expert or any carpenter to rebut the evidence led by the respondent. Even the Executive of appellant no. 1 Sh. Anil R. Pillai recommended the replacement of the doors. The District Forum has allowed the complaint to the extent of 70 % of the value of the wooden material and the labour charges and cost, but has not made any reference to the doors and the other related material supplied by the appellants and no other (to be read as ‘order’) regarding the return has been passed.
15. Accordingly, the appeal filed by the appellants is partly allowed and the impugned order under appeal dated 18.03.2008 passed by the District Forum is modified to the extent that the respondent is directed to return 16 finished doors and ten 35 mm boards within one month from the receipt of copy of the order and thereafter, the appellants shall comply the order passed by the District Forum within a period of 45 days. Except this modification, the order of the District Forum under appeal is affirmed and upheld. No order as to costs.
6.      Being aggrieved by the abovesaid order, the present two Revision Petitions have been filed; the RP 1970 of 2013 by the complainant and RP 1129 of 2014 by the OP 1.
7.      Heard the learned counsel for both the sides.  Perused the material on record. There is a delay of 207 days in filing RP 1129/ 2014 by the OP. In the interest of justice, the delay is condoned.
8.      In our thoughtful consideration, it is pertinent to note that the instant issue relates to the year 2005-05. The District Forum and the State Commission have appreciated the facts and passed the award in favour of the Complainant. We further note that the District Forum under the facts and circumstances of the case held the OPs guilty of supplying defective material and partly allowed the complaint to the extent of 70% of the value of the material. There was no Order for return of the defective doors and other material. In our view, the award and the compensation made by the District Forum was just and equitable one. However, the State Commission in the appeal modified the Order of the District Forum in the year 2013 and directed the complainant to return 16 doors and 10mm boards to the OPs. Both the parties preferred revision petitions in the year 2013 and now we are in the year 2020. Thus, in our view after the span of 15 years directing the complainants to return the defective boards is impracticable and illogical one. We agree with the concurrent findings of facts by both the fora below, but we find apparent error in the Order of the State Commission about the return of defective boards at belated stage. We are restraining ourselves for re-appreciation of the evidence in the revision petition under the scope of section 21(b) of the Act.
","9.      Based on the foregoing discussion, the revision petition no. 1970 of 2013 is allowed. The revision petition no. 1129 of 2014 is dismissed. The impugned Order dated 20.02.2013 of the State Commission is set aside. The Order dated 18.03.2008 of District Forum is upheld and affirmed.
10.    Needless to add that the District Forum shall proceed for execution as per law after four weeks from today.

1.     Heard arguments from the learned Counsel for the revisionist Improvement Trust and for the respondent Complainants.
Perused the entire material on record, in each case.
2.     These Revision Petitions, No. 1690 of 2014, No. 1691 of 2014, No. 1693 of 2014 and No. 1694 of 2014 (04 nos.), have been filed under Section 21(b) of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, against the Orders dated 25.09.2013 in FA No. 801 of 2011, dated 21.11.2013 in FA No. 1513 of 2011, dated 16.09.2013 in FA No. 1810 of 2009 and dated 16.09.2013 in FA No. 1919 of 2010, passed by The Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’, whereby the said 04 Appeals filed by the Improvement Trust against the Orders dated 01.02.2011 in CC No. 628 of 2010, dated 01.02.2010 in CC No. 239 of 2009, dated 01.09.2009 in CC No. 189 of 2008 and dated 25.01.2010 in CC No. 625 of 2009, passed by The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Ludhiana, hereinafter referred to as the ‘District Forum’, were disposed of.
3.     The Revision Petitions have been filed with delay of 1 day, in each case.
In the interest of justice, to provide fair opportunity to the revisionist Improvement Trust, to settle the matters on merit, the brief delay in filing these Revision Petitions is condoned.
RP No. 1690 of 2014
4      The short point in the case relates to levying penalty / charges for not raising construction on the allotted plot within the period stipulated   in the conditions of allotment.
5.     The District Forum appraised the case and vide its Order dated 01.02.2011 allowed the Complaint.
For ready perusal, extracts from the appraisal made by the District Forum are reproduced below:
8.       Aforesaid evidence of the Executive Officer of OP clearly spells that basic amenities in block-F were provided upto end of 2006. Though, OP had made payment between 1996 to 1999, for providing   such basic amenities. As such when basic amenities were made available in the end of 2006, OP could not have raised demand of non construction charges from the complainant. Because, as per their own allotment letter Ex.C-1 complainant was required to raise construction, within 3 years from the date of allotment. Such stipulation in allotted letter would imply raising construction, after providing basic amenities by the service provider. In absence of such basic amenities no construction could have been made.
9.       The construction could only be raised on the ground and not in the air. This means complainant could be compelled to raise construction, if possession of the allotted land proved to be delivered to him. Complainant claimed in his evidence Ex. CW1/A that possession of the plot has not been delivered in his favour. Though, in reply OP has disputed allegation of the complainant, qua non delivering possession of the plot. But in evidence nothing is stated by Sh. Lal Singh Tiwana about delivery of possession. Neither OP brought any material on the record to show that possession of the plot stand delivered to the complainant. Therefore, in such scenario, we have no hesitation to conclude that possession of the plot has yet not been handed over by OP to the complainant.
10.     It is pertinent to mention that OP had passed resolution no. 212 Ex. C-18 in 2000-01 resolving that since water supply and sewerage have not been commissioned in block-F of the scheme. So, non construction charges be not recovered from all allottees of block-F till the year, 2003.
11.     In evidence of Sh. Lal Singh Tiwana, it is conceded that basic amenities were provided in block-F upto end of year, 2006. For such reason upto 2009 OP could not have claimed construction charges from the complainant.
12.     In the present case under condition no. 8 of the allotment letter complainant was obliged to complete construction within 3 years from the date of issue of allotment letter, after getting demarcation and plan of the proposed building approved from the trust. Similar was condition imposed by Improvement Trust Barnala to Smt. Shashi Kansal and was called upon by Improvement Trust Barnala, to pay non construction charges, which she challenged in District Fora. The matter went to Hon’ble Punjab State Commission in case reported Improvement Trust Barnala Vs Mrs. Shashi Kansal 1999 (2) CLT 661 (PC). The Hon’ble State Commission held that trust was not legally entitled to claim the amount of non construction charges. That decision was upheld by the Hon’ble National Commission in Appeal no. 326/98 decided on 05.09.2005, vide which revision of the Improvement Trust against Shashi Kansal was dismissed.
13.     The Hon’ble Punjab Commission followed the same ratio in case Improvement Trust Barnala Vs Urmila Devi Appeal no. 592/2005 decided on 16.01.2006 by the Hon’ble State Commission and upheld in revision no. 833 of 2006 decided on 25.04.2006 by the Hon’ble National Commission.
14.     Aforesaid discussions leave no doubt in mind that demand of non construction charges raised by OP, against the complainant is not only arbitrary, but illegal and un-warranted as well, consequently complaint deserves to be allowed.
15.     Allowing the complaint, we quash demand of Rs. 6 lac made by OP, against the plot of the complainant on account of non construction charges and prohibit OP from realizing any non construction charges from the complainant and direct them to execute sale deed of plot no. 767-F, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Ludhiana, in favour of the complainant without demanding non construction charges and to pay him litigation cost of Rs. 2000/-(two thousand) Order be complied within 45 days of receipt of copy of this order, which be made available to the parties free of cost.
6.     The Improvement Trust filed Appeal under Section 15 of the Act before the State Commission.
The State Commission (again) appraised the case and vide its Order dated 25.09.2013 dismissed the Appeal.
For ready appreciation, extracts from the appraisal made by the State Commission are reproduced below:
","10.     The main contention is whether the appellant / opposite party is entitled to demand non-construction charges. Admittedly, the allotment letter was issued on 23.1.1998. As per the affidavit filed by Lal Singh Tiwana, E.O. of Op, it has been stated that the laying of the pipeline of water and sewerage were provided from 1996 to 1999. It is also stated in his affidavit that civil amenities were provided in Block-F upto the end of year 2006, therefore, in case basic amenities were not provided then how the non-construction charges can be demanded.
11.     Further it is to be seen whether the demand of non-construction charges / fine is illegal. Although there is a condition in the allotment letter that the construction will be raised within 3 years from the allotment but there is no provision that non-construction charges will be levied in case the construction is not completed within three years. On this point the counsel for the respondent has referred the judgment of ""Improvement Trust, Barnala Vs. Mrs. Shashi Kansal"", 1999 (2) CLT 651. In that case also there was no such condition to levy and recover Non-construction fine either in the allotment letter or in the Punjab Town Improvement Act, therefore, the demand was quashed by the State Commission and its Revision Petition No. 541 of 1999 was dismissed by the Hon'ble National Commission on 5.9.2005. With regard to administrative instructions, it was observed that in case State Govt. had issued instructions, it was incumbent upon the Improvement Trust to incorporate such terms and conditions as part of the allotment letter. In the absence of that, Improvement Trust was not authorized to legally imposed penalty or non- construction. On the same lines are, ""Nazar Ram Bali Vs. The Ludhiana Improvement Trust"", 2006(2) CPC 130 and ""Improvement Trust, Barnala Vs. Urmila Devi"", F.A. No. 592 of 2005 decided on 16.1.2006.
12.     Further in the year, 1988, Administrative Instructions were issued to levy the non-construction charges but this also cannot stand to the legal scrutiny and these were quashed in the judgment ""Tehal Singh Vs. State of Punjab"" CWP No. 13648 of 1998 decided on 4.5.1998 by DB of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, ""Sant Kaur Pabbi Vs. State of Punjab"", CWP No.18986 of 2001 decided on 31.10.2002 and again in the judgment ""Harpreet Singh VS. State of Punjab"", 2009 (2) RCR (Civil) 771 it was again reiterated after relying upon the judgment of ""Tehal Singh and others' (supra), the charging of NCF on the basis of administrative instructions have been set-aside in the judgment ""Improvement Trust, Barnala Vs. Mrs. Shashi Kansal"" 1999(2) CLT 651(Pb.), ""Nazar Ram Bali Vs. Ludhiana Improvement Trust"", 2006(2) CPC 130 (Pb.)"" and further amendment was made in the Rules in the year 2005 i.e. 15.12.2005 whereas the plot was allotted in the year 1998 and amendment in the Act cannot operate retrospectively.
13.     In ""State of M.P. Vs. Yogendra Shrivastva"", 2010(1) SCT Page 434 Supreme Court, ""Escorts Ltd. Vs. Union of India"", 2010(2) RCR (Civil) 60 (Pb. & Hry. High Court), ""Improvement Trust, Barnala versus Mrs. Shashi Kansal"", 1999(2) CLT 651, ""Nazar Ram Bali Vs. The Ludhiana Improvement Trust"", 2006 (2) CPC 130, it has been observed that amendment in rules cannot be applied retrospectively and that in case any right has accrued the same cannot be taken away. Against that judgment the appellant had filed an appeal, which was dismissed by the Hon'ble National Commission. The instructions was issued on 3.3.1988 and it was held that the NCF cannot be recovered on the basis of Administrative Instructions in the judgment ""Tehal Singh Vs. State of Punjab"" CWP No. 13648 of 1998 decided on 4.5.1998 by DB of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, ""Sant Kaur Pabbi Vs. State of Punjab"", CWP No. 18986 of 2001 decided on 31.10.2002 and again in the judgment ""Harpreet Singh VS. State of Punjab"", 2009 (2) RCR (Civil) 771, in which it was again reiterated after relying upon the judgment of ""Tehal Singh and others' (supra) that the charging of NCF cannot be recovered on the basis of administrative instructions.
14.     Whereas the counsel for the appellant has relied upon First Appeal No. 1341 of 2002 ""Improvement Trust, Barnala versus Kirna Devi"", decided on 19.12.2008 by the Punjab State Commission. In that case she was purchased the plot from the original allottee Ashok Kumar and it was observed that by that time the provision for charging the non-construction charges had already come into force but it is not the case of the complainant as the complainant is original allottee. Further in para No. 28 of the judgment it has been stated that the basic amenities were not completed by the appellant till the year 1997, therefore, the appellants were not entitled to charge non-construction charges from the complainant w.e.f. 1.1.1996. However, the counsel for the appellant has not been able to rebut the judgements relied upon by the counsel for the respondent and certainly, these judgments are of Hon'ble National Commission and Hon'ble Supreme Court are to be preferred, therefore, we are of the opinion that the findings so recorded by the learned District Forum are correct findings and we do not find any infirmity in the same and the same are hereby affirmed.
15.     In view of the above discussion, we do not find any merit in the appeal and the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.
7.     It may first be categorically stated that there is purpose for imposition of penalty / charges for not raising construction within the period stipulated in the conditions of allotment. One objective is to ensure development and habitation within a reasonable period. Another objective is to preclude prospecting in land. As such, the principle of stipulating a certain (reasonable and apt) period for raising construction on the allotted land cannot be faulted.
8.     However, in the facts and situation of the present case, it is well evinced that the Complainant was not in position to raise construction due to fundamental shortcoming and omissions on the part of the Improvement Trust. As such, in the present facts and situation, the District Forum has rightly observed in para 9 of its Order that “Construction could only be raised on the ground and not in the air.” Similarly, the State Commission has rightly observed in para 10 of its Order that “- - - therefore, in case basic amenities were not provided then how the non-construction charges can be demanded.”
9.     It is seen that the State Commission has passed a well-appraised and well-reasoned Order. It has concurred with the findings of the District Forum. The extracts from the respective appraisal made by the two Fora, quoted in paras 5 and 6 above, are particularly noteworthy.
10.   Within the ambit and scope of Section 21(b) of the Act, no palpable or crucial error in appreciating the evidence by the two Fora below is visible, as may cause to require de novo re-appreciation of the evidence in revision.
11.   No jurisdictional error, or a legal principle ignored, or miscarriage of justice, is visible, as may call for interference by this Commission in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
12.   The Award made by the District Forum, and as affirmed by the State Commission, appears just and equitable.
13.   Sequel to the above discussion, the Revision Petition is dismissed.
14.   It may however be explicitly observed that, having reference in what has been stated in para 7 above, this Revision Petition has been dismissed in the specific facts and situation of the present case.
The principle or condition, per se, of levying penalty / charges for non-construction within the stipulated period, is not faulted.
This case will not be precedent, in that each individual case would require to be adjudged on its own facts and situation, without faulting the principle or condition of levying penalty / charges for non-construction within the stipulated period.
15.   The Registry is directed to send a copy each of this Order to the District Forum, to the Chief Executive of the Improvement Trust and to the Complainant, within three days.
RP Nos. 1691 of 2014, 1693 of 2014 and 1694 of 2014 (03 nos.)
16.   Similar facts and same questions of law are involved, as in RP No. 1690 of 2014.
17.   The RPs No.1691 of 2014, 1693 of 2014 and 1693 of 2014 are dismissed in terms of the examination made hereinabove in respect of RP No. 1690 of 2014, with same observations and same directions.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant purchased the Chassis of a Swaraj Majda van from Prakash Motors, vide invoice dated 15.11.2008, for Rs.639900/-. The body of the said chassis was got fabricated for a consideration of Rs.397250/- for which an invoice dated 2.6.2009 was issued by Prakash Motors. The case of the complainant is that though the chassis had been manufactured in the year 2005 as would be evident from its Registration Certificate, it was sold to them as 2009 model. This is also the case of the petitioner / complainant that there were some defects in the ambulance van  which they had got fabricated. The petitioner/ complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint filed on 1.4.2011, about 01 year and 10 months after fabrication of the vehicle.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the respondents who stated in their reply that at the time of the sale, the petitioner/complainant was clearly informed that a 2005 model chassis was being sold to them. The respondents also denied any defect in the ambulance van fabricated for the petitioner.
","3.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the respondent Prakash Motors approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order dated 11.09.2014, the State Commission allowed the appeal and dismissed the complaint. Being aggrieved, the complainant/petitioner is before this Commission.
4.      As rightly held by the State Commission, the initial onus was upon the petitioner/complainant to prove the alleged defects in the ambulance van fabricated for it. No Automobile Engineer or any other Expert was examined to prove any manufacturing defect in the chassis or in the body fabricated on that chassis. In the absence of an expert evidence to prove the alleged defect, the State Commission in the facts and circumstances of this case, in my opinion, was justified in holding that no manufacturing defect had been proved.
5.      The main contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant is that a  chassis manufactured in 2005 was sold to them as 2009 model.  The plea taken by the petitioner/complainant is ex facie false since the sale invoice of the chassis is dated 15.11.2008, which gives model number, chassis number as well as the engine number. Obviously a chassis manufactured in 2009 could not have been sold by way of an invoice dated 15.11.2008.  If the invoice itself is of November 2008 and it bears chassis number as well as engine number, it cannot be accepted that the seller had represented to the buyer that the vehicle/chassis had been manufactured in the year 2009. The vehicle/chassis manufactured in 2009 could not be even in existence in November 2008. Therefore, the plea taken by the petitioner/complainant does not inspire confidence and cannot be accepted. Moreover, the vehicle had been registered on 12.6.2009. No one would have accepted the vehicle without Registration Certificate, if the registration is got done by the seller. Therefore, on receiving the Registration Certificate, the petitioner / complainant would certainly have come to know that the chassis had been manufactured in the year 2005, year of manufacture is having been given on the Registration Certificate. Therefore, had the respondents sold the vehicle/chassis as a 2009 model to the petitioner / complainant they would not have accepted the vehicle and would not have taken its delivery. The fact that they took delivery of the vehicle without any protest is a clear indicator that they were aware of the correct year of the chassis.
6.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the view taken by the State Commission  does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisonal jurisdiction. The revision petition is therefore dismissed, without any order as to costs.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant purchased 405 bags of cement from M/s Manoj Cement House, Jind for construction of his house.  The case of the complainant is that the said cement was used as per technical specifications but the plaster started falling soon thereafter.  Suspecting that the cement was not of the required strength a sample of the cement was got tested by him from Haryana PWD (B&R) Research Laboratory, Hissar.  Vide its report dated 12.01.1998 it was reported that the strength of the cement was not as prescribed by Punjab PWD.  The complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint impleading the seller as the sole opposite party.
2.      The seller filed a written version stating therein that the cement had been purchased by him from M/s Bharat Cement Distributors which was an authorized distributor of ACC Cement and Shree Cement.  It was also stated that the cement sold by him was manufactured by ACC Company and he had sold sealed bags of ACC Cement after purchasing the same from the distributor M/s Bharat Cement Distributors.  Thereafter the distributor Bharat Cement Distributors and the manufacturer ACC Cement were impleaded as the parties to the consumer complaint.  They file their respective written version contesting the complaint and denied that the cement was of low strength.
3.      The District Forum vide its order dated 04.08.2005 directed the distributor and the manufacturer of the cement to pay Rs. 2,82,000/- to the complainant along-with interest @ 9% p.a.  w.e.f. 08.10.2003 and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs. 3,000/-.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum both ACC Cement Ltd. and Bharat Cement Distributors approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate appeals.  Vide impugned order dated 22.02.2012 the State Commission reduced the compensation to Rs. 2,00,000/- while maintaining rest of the order.  Being still dissatisfied both the manufacturer ACC Cement Ltd. and the distributor Bharat Cement Distributors are before this Commission by way of these revision petitions.
5.      I have heard the learned counsel of ACC Cement, the manufacturer of the cement as well as the learned counsel for the complainant.  No one has appeared for M/s Bharat Cement Distributors but the learned counsel for the complainant submits that he would be press for any compensation from Bharat Cement Distributors if the compensation awarded against the manufacturer M/s ACC Cement is upheld by this Commission.
6.      The primary submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner ACC Cement Ltd. are that: (1) there is no evidence that the cement sold to the complainant was of ACC make; (2) the mortar was about 4 and half years old at the time it was analysed by Shri Ram Institute for Industrial Research and (3) the cement was as per the standards prescribed by  BIS.
7.      As far as the brand of the cement sold to the complainant is concerned the written version filed by M/s Manoj Cement clearly shows that he had purchased the cement from M/s Bharat Cement Distributors, which was sold to the complainant in sealed bags.  This  was not the case either of the distributor Bharat Cement Distributors or of manufacturer ACC Cement Ltd. before the District Forum that the cement of some other brand was sold by M/s Manoj Cement to the complainant.  No such averment is found in the written version of either of them. Therefore, I have absolutely no hesitation in confirming the findings that ACC cement was sold to the complainant in sealed bags.
8.      As far as the quality of the cement is concerned the report of the PWD Haryana clearly shows that as per the classification of PWD Haryana the strength should have been 123 Kg./Cm2 whereas it was found to be 100/105 Kg./Cm2. Therefore, as per the report of the government laboratory, which I see no reason to disbelieve, the cement was of low strength as compared to the strength prescribed by PWD Haryana.
9.      The District Forum had sent the sample of the mortar to Shri Ram Institute of Industrial Research.  The said Institute examined the sample very late, the sample having been received on 18.10.2002.  The submission of the learned counsel for the manufacturer is that after such a time gap it is not possible to analyze the strength of the cement on the basis of the sample of the mortar.  In this regard the State Commission has relied upon the cross-examination of an expert from Shri Ram Institute of Industrial Research. But even if I exclude the report of Shri Ram Institute of Industrial Research altogether from consideration, the report of the  laboratory of PWD Haryana by itself is sufficient to prove that the strength of the cement sold to the complainant was not of the prescribed standards.  That report by itself is sufficient to prove that ACC cement which M/s Manoj Cement sold to the complainant in sealed bags did not have the strength prescribed by Haryana PWD.  In a revision petition this Commission will not be justified in interfering with a finding of fact returned by the Fora below, unless the same is shown to be perverse in the sense unless it is shown such a finding could not have been returned by any reasonable person acting on the basis of material available to him.  In my opinion, the Fora below were justified in returning the findings in favour of the complainant on the basis of the unrebutted report of the laboratory of PWD Haryana alone.  Therefore, the said findings cannot be said to be perverse so as to require interference by this Commission in merits of its revisional jurisdiction.
","10.    For the reasons stated hereinabove the revision petition bearing No. 2772/2012 filed by ACC Ltd. is hereby dismissed.  As far as the revision petition bearing No. 2324/2012 filed by M/s Bharat Cement Distributors is concerned, the impugned order, to the extent it is directed against M/s Bharat Cement Distributors is set aside, meaning thereby that the complainant will be entitled to the compensation awarded by the Fora below only from the manufacturer of the cement i.e. M/s ACC Cement Ltd.  Both the revision petitions stand disposed of.

ORDER
1.      The revision petition has been filed under Section 21(b) of The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Act’, challenging the Order dated 02.09.2016 of the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Nagpur Circuit Bench (hereinafter referred to as the ‘State Commission’) in the first appeal No.A/759/09 which dismissed the appeal filed by the builder co.- OP /petitioner  and confirmed the order of District Forum.
2.      Brief facts that the M/s Vaibhav Laxmi Builders & Developers (OP/ petitioner)   agreed to sell a plot to the complainant for a consideration of Rs. 10,64,027/- vide agreement dated 01.02.2008. The payment was to be made in the installments but , on 01.02.2008 the complainant made part payment in one time of Rs. 5,00,000/-. The OP agreed to develop the plot within 3 to 4 months and execute the sale deed on or before 01.02.2009. The balance amount was agreed to be paid at the time of execution of sale deed. However, the OP failed to do so. The complainant being aggrieved by the deficiency in service of OP, that non- development of land and non- refund of the money, filed a complaint no 129/2009 before the District Forum, Nagpur.
3.      The OP filed written version and denied the deficiency. OP submitted that the complainant failed to pay the installments regularly, therefore she requested the OP to execute a new agreement. As per the terms of agreement, if three continuous installments not paid, the agreement would become void and the amount paid would be forfeited. At the request of the complainant, on 06.10.2008 a new agreement was executed by the OP and reduced the installment amount. The execution of Sale Deed was fixed on 10.02.2010, thus the complaint was prematurely filed.
4.      The District Forum on hearing the parties partly allowed the complaint vide its order dated 12.10.2009 and directed the builder co. to pay Rs.5,00,000/- along with 12 % interest thereon from 01.10.2008 till its realization and cost of Rs.2000/- for litigation.
5.      Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the OP appealed to the State Commission.  The State Commission, vide order dated 02.09.2016 dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order of District Forum.
6.      The OP filed the instant revision petition against the order of State Commission.
7.      Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at admission stage and perused the material on record inter-alia the application for condonation of delay in filing the instant revision petition.
8.      There is a huge delay of 1007 days in filing this revision petition. The petitioner explained the reasons for the delay in its paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the application are reproduced as below:
2.       That the Petitioner was under the impression that the First Appeal was still pending before the Hon’ble State Commission. That the Petitioner had no knowledge of the Impugned order being passed by the Hon’ble State Commission on 02.09.2016, as the earlier counsel of the Petitioner did not inform him about the Impugned order. The Petitioner therefore had no knowledge of the impugned order having been passed.
3.       The Petitioner only received knowledge of the impugned order much later, to be precise the Petitioner received information of the aforesaid judgment in the month of September 2017, after the Respondent filed Execution Application No. 10/2010 on 24.08.2017, before the District Forum and made Petitioner as a party to it. A copy of the Application No. 10/2010 dated 24.08.2017 filed before the Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Nagpur is already marked as Annexure P-9 along with the Revision Petition.
4.       It is pertinent to mention here that the settlement talks were going on between the parties since last 2 years after the Respondent filed Execution Application before the District Forum. Solely, due to the settlement talks between the parties, and hoping that the matter would be settled amicably, the Petitioner did not file the Revision Petition earlier. Later in the month of November 2019, the settlement between the parties failed and soon after that, the Petitioner then took some time, seeking legal advice, whether he should challenge the impugned order or not. Then the Petitioner, sought some time, locating advocate in Delhi, to file the instant Revision Petition in the National Commission, Delhi, to challenge the impugned order. The Petitioner then spent some time giving instructions to the Advocate, sending all the necessary documents to Delhi to the Advocate, for the purpose of preparing the Revision Petition.
5.       That this entire process took some time and the Revision Petition could only be filed with delay of ___ days.
9.      On bare perusal of the endorsement on the Order of State Commission, the free copy was issued on 14.12.2016 and the 2nd copy was issued on 30.07.2019. The instant revision petition was filed on 16.12.2019, it is surprising that the petitioner slept over the matter for pretty long time and suddenly woke-up at execution stage in August 2017. The delay was deliberate and intentional to harass the complainant.
10.    I would like to rely upon the decision of Hon’ble Supreme Court which made strong observations on the delay/ limitation. In the case of Anshul Aggarwal v. New Okhla Industrial Development Authority IV (2011) CPJ63 (SC), wherein it was held that:
It is also apposite to observe that while deciding an application filed in such cases for condonation of delay, the Court has to keep in mind that the special period of limitation has been prescribed under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for filing appeals and revisions in consumer matters and the object of expeditious adjudication of the consumer disputes will get defeated if this Court was to entertain highly belated petitions filed against the orders of the consumer Foras.
11.    The Act 1986 is “to provide speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes” (Statement of Objects and Reasons). This revision petition has been filed with huge delay of 1007 days.
12.     The reasons for delay, as stated in paras 2 to 5 of the application for condonation of delay, point towards managerial inefficiency and perfunctory and casual attitude to the law of limitation, they are illogical and unpersuasive in explaining cogently and convincingly the delay in filing the appeal.
13.    Sufficient cause to explain the delay is not visible. In my view condonation of delay would depend on the background of each and every case; and routine explanation would not be enough.
14.   Without in any manner attempting to enter into or adjudicate on the impugned Order of the State Commission on merit, I but do not find any reason visible to my satisfaction that there would be any miscarriage of justice if the delay is not condoned.
15.    I find the State Commission’s impugned Order to be well-appraised and well-reasoned Order which affirmed the view of District Forum. I do not find any illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional error in the said order.
16.    The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its recent judgment in the case of M/s. Singal Udyog v. National Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors Civil Appeal No.9161 of 2019, decided on 02.12.2019 held that where the National Commission finds an appeal to be barred by time, it need not deal with the merits of the matter. The instant matter is time barred and there is no need to enter into its merit.
","17.    The application for condonation of delay, being unconvincing and bereft of merit, is dismissed. Consequently the revision petition is also dismissed in limine being barred by limitation.
18.    Needless to add that the District Forum shall undertake execution of its Order as per the law.
19.    A copy each of this Order be sent to the District Forum and to the complainant by the Registry within ten days.

For the Respondent No.3         :    Nemo 
","This appeal has been filed by the appellant Emirates Airlines challenging the order dated 08.01.2013 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, West Bengal (in short ‘the State Commission’) in S.C.Case No.CC/23/2012.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent Nos.1 & 2 travelled from Kolkata to Los Angeles via Dubai by the appellant Airlines on 05.08.2011.  They boarded the flight from Kolkata to Dubai and they were to board another flight from Dubai to Los Angeles.  Respondent No.1 was stopped and was not allowed to board the flight at Dubai.  The Airline deported the respondent No.1 to India and respondent No.2 did not continue the travel to USA as she also came back to India along with her husband respondent No.1. Respondents filed a consumer complainant being S.C.Case No.CC/23/2012 before the State Commission alleging deficiency on the part of the appellant Airlines and claiming Rs.17,00,000/- for each of them as compensation along with refund of the ticket amount.  The complaint was resisted by the appellant Airlines on the ground that there was no deficiency on the part of the appellant Airlines, rather, respondent No.1 was not allowed to travel further from Dubai to Los Angeles on the advice of the US Immigration Department informing that “Z” series Passport of the respondent No.1 was recalled by Government of India and the Passport was not valid.  However, the State Commission vide its order dated 08.01.2013 partly allowed the complaint as under:-
“Hence, it is ORDERED that the petition of complaint stands allowed in part on contest against the OP No.1 with cost of Rs.10,000/- and dismissed ex parte without cost against the OP No.2.  The complainants are entitled to get Rs.4,24,280/- towards price of the airfares and Rs.4,00,000/- towards compensation for harassment and mental agony.  The OP No.1 is directed to clear off the said amounts within 45 days from the date of this order, failing which the amounts will carry interest @ 9% per annum till realization in full.”
3.      Hence the present appeal.
4.      During the pendency of the present appeal, the respondent No.1 expired on 02.03.2020 and the respondent No.2 sent an e-mail communication to her counsel that she was not interested in pursuing the present proceedings after the death of her husband.  Based on this communication, learned counsel for the respondents has been discharged on 11.09.2020.  The learned counsel for the appellant was asked to substitute the legal heirs in place of respondent No.1.  Learned counsel for the appellant has sent an e-mail informing that she had sent an e-mail to respondent No.2 to inform the LRs of respondent no.1.  In response, she has received e-mail from the son and daughter of respondent Nos.1 & 2 informing that they are not interested in continuing with the present case after the death of their father.  In these circumstances, the learned counsel for the appellant was heard on 11.09.2020.
5.      Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the Airline could not continue with further flight of respondent No.1 from Dubai to Los Angeles on account of advisory of US Immigration Department that “Z” series Passport of respondent No.1 has been recalled by Government of India and Passport was not valid.  Thus, the Airline did not have any other option, but to send back respondent No.1 to Kolkata India.  Though there was no restriction for further journey of respondent No.2, however, respondent No.2 herself opted to go back to Kolkata along with her husband.  In these circumstances, respondents could not continue their journey beyond Dubai.  Thus, there was no deficiency on the part of the appellant Airlines and there should be no question of awarding of compensation to the respondents.  As the ticket was also partly utilised and respondents could not continue with the travel due to their own shortcoming and not due to any fault of appellant Airlines, the appellant Airlines is not bound to refund the ticket amount.  The State Commission has ordered refund of the ticket amount of Rs.4,24,280/- and in addition, the State Commission has also asked appellant Airlines to pay a compensation of Rs.4,00,000/- to the complainants for which there is no justification.
6.      The learned counsel further argued that there was no written communication from US Immigration Department to the Airlines and therefore, the same cannot be filed as proof, but the fact is that due to non-clearance by the US Immigration Department, respondent No.1 was stopped from boarding the plane at Dubai for his journey to Los Angeles.  She further stated that the laws of US Immigration Department which are binding on the Airlines as the Airlines is operating in USA as well, the Airlines is not supposed to disclose the reason due to security concerns.  Learned counsel stated that the fact is that “Z” series Passports were recalled by Government of India and these Passports were not valid.  There must have been some communication to respondent No.1, however, he did not disclose at the time of boarding at Kolkata and the Airlines was also not aware about this fact, therefore, the Airlines allowed him to board.  The learned counsel further stated that she could not obtain the copy of the said notification from Government of India or from internet, therefore, the same has not been filed.  She has filed certain newspapers where it is mentioned that “Z” series Passports have been recalled by Government of India.  She further argued that during the earlier hearing, it was informed by the respondent that after cancellation of his “Z” series Passport, the respondent No.1 travelled to USA on a new Passport.  This Commission vide order dated 13.11.2017 ordered the respondent No.1 to present his “Z” series Passport and his new Passport.  The learned counsel stated that the respondents have filed certain copies of some pages of the Passport, but they are related to earlier travels and not after the incident in question.  She further stated that the original Passport has not been filed, which clearly implies that “Z” series Passport of respondent No.1 was not valid and that is why he had to travel on new Passport.  It was also emphasised by the learned counsel that when direct evidence is not available, one has to rely on circumstantial evidence.  It was vehemently argued by the learned counsel that for defect in the travel documents, the Airlines cannot be held responsible as held by this Commission in Air India Vs. Sushil Kumar, II (2015) CPJ 75 (NC), wherein the following has been observed:-
“18.    The IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passengers and Baggage) Article 7 expressly provides, “if the passenger fails to arrive in time at the Carrier’s check in location or boarding gate or appears improperly documented and not ready to travel, carrier may cancel the space reserved for the passenger and will not delay the flight. Carrier is not liable to the passenger for loss or expenses due to the passenger’s failure to comply with the provisions of this Article”.
19.    The IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passengers and Baggage) Article 8.1.6 gives right to refuse carriage if the passenger does not appear to be properly documented.
20.    The IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passengers and Baggage) Article 14.1 expressly provide that passenger shall be solely responsible for complying all laws, regulations, orders, demands and travel requirements of countries to be flown from, into or over and with carrier’s regulations and instructions. Carrier shall not be liable for any aid or information given by any agent or employee of carrier to any passenger in connection with obtaining necessary documents or visas or complying with such laws, regulations, orders, demands and travel requirements, whether given in writing or otherwise; or for the consequences to any passenger resulting from his failure to obtain such documents or visas or to comply with such laws, regulations, orders, demands, requirements rules or instructions.
21.    The governing IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passenger and Baggage) Article 14.2 expressly provide that Carrier reserves the right to refuse carriage of any passenger who has not complied with applicable laws, regulations, orders, demands or requirements or whose documents do not appear to be in order.
22.    The Governing IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passengers and Baggage) exonerate the petitioner Airline from any liability, even if any representation is made by an agent or employee of the petitioner airline in the matter of travel documents, visa requirements or other countries., In these circumstances, the impugned order suffer from material irregularity and illegality and merits to be set aside.”
7.      It was further emphasised by the learned counsel for the appellant Airlines that under the procedure of US Immigration Department, the passenger had directly contacted the US Immigration Authorities as would be clear from e-mail dated 09.08.2011 sent by travel agent of the respondents which reads as under:-
“This is to bring to your kind notice that we had booked passengers as per PNR details given booking to travel to Los Angles on Business class. Pls note both our passengers were allowed to board the flight for Kolkata to Dubai and were issued Boarding passes at Kolkata airport for their onward travel to Los Angles.  On arrival in Dubai they were waiting for their onward flight, it may be please noted that when the passenger were about to board the flight to Los Angles, they were stopped by your security staff and denied boarding due to immigration problems.
The passenger had to put up at the hotel at Dubai Airport on their own expense and were sent back on the next available flight. On arrival in Kolkata the passenger Mr. Srikanta Saha called the US Embassy as was told that since, his passport was issued with a Z Series, the same was not in order for travel to USA and the airlines were aware of this.
Your airport staff should have checked the passport and other relevant documents before issuing the boarding passes at the Kolkata airport to avoid the harassment and mental torture our passengers had to go through.
Please look into the matter and allow full refund for the tickets issued to the passengers to avoid unnecessary further complications.”
8.      The learned counsel emphasised that it was thus clear that the respondent No.1 was convinced that he was stopped due to some immigration issue and not due to any fault on the part of the appellant Airlines.
9.      We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant and have examined the record.  Even though respondents are not interested in continuing with this litigation now, however, appeal needs to be decided on merits.  The appellant has not been able to file any document proving that the Government of India had recalled the “Z” series Passports.  Moreover, if such notification was issued by Government of India, the same would have definitely gone to all the Airlines and it was the duty of the appellant Airlines to have not allowed the respondent No.1 to board the plane at Kolkata itself.  Even the travel agent of the respondents vide e-mail dated 09.08.2011 has informed the Airlines that respondent No.1 contacted the U.S. Immigration staff and he was informed that “Z” series Passport was not valid to travel to U.S.A and the Airlines knew about the same.  Thus, clearly, there was negligence in allowing respondent No.1 to board the plane at Kolkata.  If the travel documents of a passenger are not valid, the Airline is not supposed to allow boarding of that passenger. The negligence by the Airlines has led to great inconvenience and harassment to the complainants.  The travel agent of the respondents has also recommended refund of the amount of tickets to avoid further complications. There is no doubt that the Airlines is not responsible for any defect in the travel document of the passenger, however, in the present case the Airlines negligently allowed the boarding of the concerned passenger at Kolkata Airport.  The case of Air India Vs. Sushil Kumar (supra) referred to by the learned counsel for the appellant does not seem to be applicable in the present set of facts and circumstances because in that case the journey had not commenced, whereas in the present case, the Airlines allowed the journey upto Dubai.  Moreover, an additional transit visa was required in the matter of Air India Vs. Sushil Kumar (supra) whereas in the present case no extra visa was required by the complainants.  The IATA guidelines are equally applicable in the present case as well.  However, in the present case, the complainants are being compensated due to the negligence of the Airlines for allowing them to board plane at Kolkata at first place.  Had the deficiency in the passport of respondent no.1 been pointed out at Kolkata, the complainants would not have boarded the plane to avoid further harassment and mental agony as well as inconvenience. In these circumstances, clearly the order of refund of the ticket amount of Rs.4,24,280/- passed by the State Commission is justified.  As enough time has elapsed, this amount needs to be paid with interest.  We deem it appropriate that this amount be paid with interest of 5% p.a. from the date of the order of the State Commission till actual payment.
10.    So far as compensation for mental agony and harassment is concerned, the State Commission has awarded Rs.4,00,000/- as compensation for mental agony and harassment to the complainants which seems on a high side.  In fact, the travel agent of the complainants had initially written to the Airlines vide e-mail dated 09.08.2011 for refund of the ticket amount only.  It gives an indication that the initial demand of the complainants was for the refund of the airfare.  As the complainants had to file the consumer complaint, they definitely deserve some compensation for mental agony and harassment apart from refund of the ticket amount.  As the interest has also been awarded on the amount paid for airfare, we deem it appropriate to award Rs.30,000/- (rupees thirty thousand only) as compensation for mental agony and harassment to the complainants and to cover incidental expenses.
11.    Based on the above discussion, the First Appeal No.94 of 2013 is partly allowed and the order dated 08.01.2013 of the State Commission is modified to the extent that the appellant Airlines shall refund the amount of Rs.4,24,280/-  alongwith interest @5% per annum from the date of order of the State Commission i.e. from 08.01.2013 till actual payment to the respondent No.2 along with a compensation of Rs.30,000/-(rupees thirty thousand only).

  For the Appellant     :Mr. Rajesh Mahale, Advocate. 
  For the Respondent      :
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent agreed to purchase a residential flat from the appellant in a project namely Alta Vista Residential Complex for a consideration of Rs. 32 lakhs and executed an agreement with the appellant in this regard on 09.12.2010.  As per the agreement, the apartment was to be completed, in all respects, on or before 31.07.2011.  Clause 2.1 of the agreement specifically provided for delivery of possession to the complainant by 31.07.2011.  The possession having not been delivered to him the complainant approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint seeking refund of the amount which he had paid to the appellant.
2.        The complaint was resisted by the appellant primarily on the ground that the complainant had failed to pay the balance amount of Rs.213500/- and the appellant had already completed the construction in all respects besides obtaining the completion certificate.
3.        The State Commission vide order dated 08.07.2019 directed the appellant to refund the principal amount of Rs. 29,86,500/- received by the appellant from the complainant along with interet @ 12% p.a. and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs. 10,000/-.  Being aggrieved the appellant is before this Commission by way of this appeal.
4.        The first submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that the construction was completed and even the requisite occupancy certificate was obtained by the appellant on 25.09.2013.
5.        The occupancy certificate filed by the appellant and available at pages 77-78 of the paper book is in respect of Blocks No. 1 and 2 comprising GF+08UF & Club House GF+FF with 196 dwelling units. The agreement executed between the parties does not disclose the number of the block in which the flat allotted to the complainant was to be located.  In the absence of such particulars it cannot be verified whether the occupancy certificate dated 07.12.2013 obtained by the appellant covered the flat allotted to the complaint or not.
6.        Even if it is assumed that the above-referred occupancy certificate dated 07.12.2013 did cover the flat allotted to the complainant, there is no evidence of the appellant having offered possession of the allotted flat to the complainant at any time after 07.12.2013.  I have perused the written version to the consumer complaint.  There is no averment in the written version that on receipt of the occupancy certificate dated 07.12.2013 the possession of the allotted flat was offered by the appellant to the complainant.  No letter offering possession of the allotted flat to the complainant after 07.12.2013 was filed by the appellant.  Therefore, it would be difficult to say that the appellant had offered possession of the allotted flat to the complainant before institution of the consumer complaint which came to be instituted on 13.06.2014.
7.        As noted earlier the possession was to be delivered to the complainant by 03.07.2011.  Even if it is assumed that the occupancy certificate dated 07.12.2013 covered the flat offered to the complainant, it is evident that the said occupancy certificate was obtained after delay of about 2 years and five months from the date by which possession was to be delivered to the complainant.  Considering the extent of the delay and in the absence of any explanation for the said delay the complainant was not under an obligation to take possession of the allotted flat even after it is assumed that it was offered to her after obtaining the occupancy certificate on 07.12.2013.  A reference in this regard can be made to the recent decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. Vs. Govindan Raghavan & Connected Matters, (2019) 5 SCC 725.
In Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. (supra), the builder submitted before this Commission itself that since the construction of the apartment was complete and Occupancy Certificate had been obtained, the flat purchaser must be directed to accept the possession instead of directing refund of the amount deposited.  In that case, there was a delay of about three years in offering possession and the flat purchaser had submitted that he was not interested in taking possession after delay of about three years.  He also stated that he had taken an alternative property in Gurgaon.  This Commission having allowed refund to the complainant/respondent, the appellant before the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia contended that as per the terms of the agreement executed between the parties, the flat purchaser could claim refund only after expiry of twelve months from the grace period by terminating the agreement but the Consumer Complaint had been filed even before the said twelve months period after the grace period had come to an end.  It was also submitted on behalf of the builder that this Commission had erred in granting interest at the rate of 10.7% per annum to the complainant when the agreement between the parties provided for payment of interest @ 6% per annum in case of delay in handing over possession.  Rejecting the contentions advanced by the builder, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter-alia held as under:
6.1. In the present case, admittedly the Appellant – Builder obtained the Occupancy Certificate almost 2 years after the date stipulated in the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement. As a consequence, there was a failure to hand over possession of the flat to the Respondent – Flat Purchaser within a reasonable period. The Occupancy Certificate was obtained after a delay of more than 2 years on 28.08.2018 during the pendency of the proceedings before the National Commission.
In Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta,2 this Court held that when a person hires the services of a builder, or a contractor, for the construction of a house or a flat, and the same is for a consideration, it is a “service” as defined by Section 2 (o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The inordinate delay in handing over possession of the flat clearly amounts to deficiency of service.
In Fortune Infrastructure & Anr. v. Trevor D’Lima & Ors.,3 this Court held that a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the flat allotted to him, and is entitled to seek refund of the amount paid by him, along with compensation.
6.2. The Respondent – Flat Purchaser has made out a clear case of deficiency of service on the part of the Appellant – Builder. The Respondent – Flat Purchaser was justified in terminating the Apartment Buyer’s Agreement by filing the Consumer Complaint, and cannot be compelled to accept the possession whenever it is offered by the Builder. The Respondent – Purchaser was legally entitled to seek refund of the money deposited by him along with appropriate compensation.
8.        It is next submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant that out of the amount paid by the complainant only Rs. 27,73,000/- were paid  as principal amount and the balance amount to Rs. 2,37,602/- was paid towards service tax which the appellant has also deposited with the concerned authorities.  There is no evidence of the tax having been deposited by the appellant with the concerned authorities.  In any case nothing prevents the appellant from recovering the tax from the person to whom it would be entitled to sale the flat which it had allotted to the complainant or seeking refund of the said tax on the ground that the transaction with the complainant had not materialized.
9.        The learned Counsel for the appellant lastly submits that no interest at all should have been awarded to the complainant, since the money had been utilized for construction of the apartment.  I, however, find no merit in the contention.  The appellant having used the money received from the complainant and thereby the complainant having deprived of the said money the directions for payment of interest would be fully justified.
10.      No other submission is made by the learned Counsel for the appellant.
","11.      From the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellant, no ground is made out to set aside the order passed by the State Commission.  The appeal is dismissed with no orders as costs.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:

It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

                                                Mr. Niladri Banerjee, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","1.       This appeal is directed against the order of the West Bengal State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Commission, Kolkata (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission) dated 02.12.2019 in CC/149/2018.
2.       Case of the Complainants is that by way of a tripartite agreement of nomination dated 12th December, 2011, Pallak Fashion Pvt. Ltd. nominated the Appellants/Complainants for one unit measuring 506.83 sq. ft. super built up area in tower “Prakiti Plaza” at Godrej Prakiti, Kolkata. The due date of possession of unit was 28th February, 2013. Though the Appellants paid Rs.13,18,697/-, about 77% of the total cost of the flat by 28th February, 2013, the Respondents failed to hand over the unit within the time stipulated. Rest of the payment due was made by the Appellants and got the conveyance deed registered on 9th October, 2017. For taking possession of the unit, Respondent No.1 insisted on signing of a waiver clause to compensate for delay in giving possession. Aggrieved by this action of the Respondents, the Appellants preferred Complaint before the State Commission praying the following reliefs:-
i.        An order directing the opposite parties to handover vacant and peaceful possession of the said unit in favour of the complainants;
ii.      An order directing the opposite parties to compensate the complainants with payment of interest for delayed delivery of possession of the residential unit No.01 on the ground floor of the complex known as “GODREJ PRAKRITI” lying and situated at the municipal holding no.187F/1, B.T. Road, Kolkata 700115 for the period from 1st March, 2013 to 31st March, 2017 @ 9% per annum amounting to Rs.4,74,730/- alongwtih further interest on Rs.4,74,730/- for the period from 10th October, 2017 till the actual date of payment @ 18% per annum;
iii.     An order directing the opposite parties to provide the complainants water connection to the said unit, completion certificate, electricity supply at the said unit and provide each and every common facility and amenity in terms of the deed of conveyance dated 9th October, 2017 read with the agreement for sale dated 13th June, 2011 and in accordance with the promises and assurances given by the opposite parties at the time of publicity of the project and invitation for booking of the said unit;
iv.      An order directing the opposite parties to pay Rs.5,00,000/- (Rs. Five Lakhs only) as compensation to complainants for deficiency of service and negligence on the part of the opposite parties in not providing the facilities and amenities and completion certificate as detailed in prayer (c) above immediately upon execution of the deed of conveyance dated 9th October, 2017 read with the agreement for sale dated 13th June, 2011 and in accordance with the promises and assurances given by the opposite parties at the time of publicity of the project and invitation for booking of the said unit;
v.       An order directing the opposite parties to pay Rs.3,00,000/- (Rs. Three Lakhs only) as compensation to complainants for causing mental harassment and agony;
vi.      An order directing the opposite parties to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) for legal expenses and other incidental costs;
vii.     An ad-interim order in terms of prayer (a) above;
viii.    Such other and/or further orders(s)/directions as this Hon’ble Commission may deem fit and proper.
","3.       After hearing the case, alongwith all the interlocutory applications, the State Commission dismissed the Complaint allowing IA/919/2018 and IA/1131/2019 finding that the Appellants/Complainants were not consumers in terms of Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
4.       Heard the Learned Counsel for the Appellants and also carefully perused the record. The Complainants have booked one unit measuring 506.83 sq. ft. super built up area in tower “Prakiti Plaza” in the complex Godrej Prakiti, Kolkata. Conveyance deed was also executed by Opposite Party No.1 in favour of the Complainants but for want of certain conditionalities attached for delivery of possession, the Appellants/Complainants filed a Complaint before the State Commission.
5.       The Opposite Parties contended before the State Commission that the Complainants purchased the unit in question for commercial purpose and therefore could not be termed as “Consumer” within the meaning of Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Counsel for the Complainants could not give satisfactory explanation denying the contention of the Opposite Parties. No averment was made before the State Commission that the Complaints intended to purchase the commercial space for earning livelihood by means of self-employment. As the Appellants/Complainants failed to prove that they had purchased the space for the purpose of earning livelihood by means of self-employment, the State Commission held that the Complainants cannot be categorized as “Consumers” and thereby allowed IA/919/2018 and IA/1131/2019 and rejected the Complaint as not maintainable.
6.       During the course of arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants could not also provide any plausible explanation as to how they are covered by the definition of Consumer as provided in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines a consumer as under:-
(d)     ""consumer"" means any person who—
(i)  buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly prom­ised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services other than the person who 'hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person who avails of such services for any commercial purposes;
Explanation.— For the purposes of this clause, “commercial purpose” does not include use by a person of goods bought and used by him and services availed by him exclusively for the purposes of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment;
7.       The Appellants are father and son. Learned Counsel for the Appellant stated that the father is a retired person and the son works in Tata Consultancy Services. No proof or evidence could be furnished of their being engaged in any business or profession where the space could be used for self-employment and earning their livelihood. In the absence of any record/evidence to prove that the commercial space was purchased for earning livelihood by means of self-employment, the Complainants cannot seek refuge under the explanation provided under Section 2 (1) (d) of the Act.
8.       In view of the above, I find no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the State Commission. The Complainants not being Consumers under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, the State Commission had rightly rejected the Complaint as being not maintainable. In the result, the Appeal is dismissed in limine as not maintainable.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. PREM NARAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Appellant     :Mr. R.N.Mishra, Auth. Rep. 
  For the Respondent      :Mr. Vishnu Mehra, Advocate with 
			    Ms. Simran Mehotra, Advcoate 
","These appeals have been filed by the appellant M/s. Shyama Rama Structural & Power Pvt. Ltd. against the order dated 23.12.2014 passed in three separate Complaint Case Nos.12 of 2010, 13 of 2010 & 14 of 2010.  These three complaint cases relate to three different incidents of fire, which resulted in loss of machinery at different occasions.  Three separate insurance claims were filed, which were repudiated leading to filing of these complaints by the complainant.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the complainant is a manufacturing unit that manufactures the M.S. Ingot in its production furnace division and Re-rolled products in its Re-rolling Mill division. The complainant had purchased 2 “Fire and Special Perils” policy from the OP. First, policy no. 152308/11/2010/138 for all the plant & machinery of Induction Furnace & Crucible division for a sum assured of Rs.1,50,00,000/- and second, policy no. 152308/11/2010/137 for plant & machinery of Rolling Mill division for a sum assured of Rs.45,00,000/- for the period from 21.05.2009 to 20.05.2010. The first accident of fire occurred on 27.9.2009 and second accident of fire took place on 1.10.2009 during the currency of these policies.  As nature of these two accidents is similar, the discussion will concentrate on the accident occurred on 1.10.2009. On 01.10.2009 when the induction furnace crucible no. 1 was running, a fire accident occurred due to an explosion from the charging of M.S. Scrap and sponge iron in the furnace. The complainant intimated regarding the said incident to the Police Station, the OP, and the Andhra Bank on the same day. Subject incidents of FA 35 and FA 36 of 2015 are covered under these policies.  These appeals relate to CC No.12 and CC No.13 of 2010 filed by the complainant before the State Commission.
3.      The complainant had renewed 2 Fire and Special Perils policies from the OP. First, policy no. 191300/11/2011/123 for all the plant & machinery of Induction Furnace & Crucible division for a sum assured of Rs.2,35,00,000/- and second, policy no. 191300/11/2011/122 for plant & machinery of Rolling Mill division for a sum assured of Rs.1,35,00,000/- for the period from 24.05.2010 to 23.05.2011.  There was a fire accident on 4.10.2010 and FA 56 of 2015 deals with this accident.  In this case, CC No.14 of 2010 was filed by the complainant before the State Commission.
4.      These complaints were resisted by the Insurance Company by filing the written statement on the ground that the surveyor had not found that there was any explosion resulting in the fire and no peril under the policy was attracted in the present cases.  Hence, the claims were not payable.  The State Commission vide its order dated 23.12.2014 has allowed claims of Rs.3,92,868/- in CC No.12 of 2010, Rs.2,65,036/- in CC No.13 of 2010 and CC No.14 of 2014 has been dismissed.
5.      Not satisfied with the award of the State Commission, these three appeals have been filed by the appellant/complainant.  Heard AR of the appellant and learned counsel for the respondent Insurance Company and perused the record.
6.      The AR of the appellant stated that the State Commission has not accepted the peril of explosion on the ground that explosion does not find any mention in the FIR lodged on behalf of the complainant. It was incumbent upon the State Commission to have decided the cause of loss, but the State Commission has not decided the cause of loss.  In the claim form, it was clearly submitted that the fire was caused due to explosion and even in the preliminary survey, the surveyor in his report dated 30.09.2009 has admitted that there was an explosion resulting in the fire.  However, the final surveyor has not agreed with the explosion and it has been concluded by the final surveyor that no peril under the policy was attached and the cases were not covered under the present policy.  AR of the appellant further stated that there was an annual maintenance contract with another company namely Magatherm Electronics Pvt. Ltd. and the service engineer of that company had also inspected the factory during the accident and has analysed the reasons behind the fire and has submitted report dated 07.10.2009, wherein it has been clearly mentioned that:-
“We have given to understand from the meter & operating labors that the incident was occurred due to explosion in the furnace from M.S.Scrap and Sponge iron.  In the centering (first) heat of patching cycle, after charging the scrap with sponge iron, they have switch on the system and after running the furnace of four hour, suddenly they heard blasting sound and noticed hot liquid metal draining from bottom of furnace.  Immediately incoming protection breaker tripped (disconnect) the electrical line.  Even though due to the temperature of hot metal all the listed components were damaged & destroyed in the operating furnace as well as in stand by furnace crucible no.1 because the repairing work is running nearest to crucible no.1. The chemical & Lamination of yoke of crucible no.2 have been burned due to temperature of hot metal.
The cause of blasting was due to mix up of some airtight metal container with scrap/sponge iron and charged in furnace.  After heated up the container in side air expand, resulting occurred explosion.  In such condition the in built protection systems can’t protect the furnace.  Such incident occurs very often in mini steel industries and so far no such remade takes placed”.
7.      AR argued that surveyor in his report has stated that he has considered the report of the service engineer of Megatherm Electronics Pvt. Ltd..  However, the surveyor was cross examined and it has come out that there was no interaction between the service engineer and the surveyor. The surveyor has not considered the report of the service engineer.  It was stated by the AR that the surveyor has not assessed the loss in his final survey report, though it was his duty to do so.
8.      It was further stated by the AR of the appellant that the Insurance Company had made up its mind to repudiate the claim right from very beginning and that is why the surveyor in the final report has also not assessed the loss.  When the surveyor report was presented before the State Commission, the surveyor filed affidavits in all the three cases.  In CC No.12 of 2010 & CC No.13 of 2010, the surveyor filed affidavits along with annexure which had the calculation of the assessed loss.  The State Commission has agreed with the report of the surveyor and the assessment of the loss.  The surveyor has given no basis for applying 60% depreciation on machinery particularly the furnace and 50% depreciation on other parts.  The AR stated that in the CC No.12 of 2010 (First Appeal No.35 of 2015), the surveyor in its affidavit dated 11.05.2012 has mentioned 10 machinery items as damaged.  In the annexure, the surveyor has calculated the total value of these items as Rs.16,59,000/-, whereas the fact  is that the value of these items is about Rs.32,00,000/- as given by the Service Engineer of Magatherm Electronics Pvt. Ltd.  Thus, it is not clear as to how the surveyor has arrived on valuation of these 10 items.  Had the surveyor given these details in the final survey report, the appellant could have contested these things.  Though no basis has been given for this assessment by the surveyor, still the State Commission has accepted the assessment given by the surveyor.
9.      In respect of First Appeal No.56 of 2015, the AR stated that the incident was exactly similar to other two accidents that happened on 27.9.2009 (First Appeal No.36 of 2015) and 01.10.2009 (First Appeal No.35 of 2015), but in this case the surveyor has not assessed any loss stating that it was a case of machinery break down and there was no explosion.  The State Commission has also agreed with this assertion of the surveyor without any further examination. Just because the surveyor has not assessed any loss under this item, the State Commission has also thought it convenient to dismiss the complaint otherwise the question of assessment of loss will arise.  The AR argued that there is no basis to differentiate this case from the other two cases where the surveyor has assessed the loss and the State Commission has accepted the report of the surveyor.
10.  On the other hand, the learned counsel for the opposite party/Insurance Company stated that in no incident, the fire has been seen by anybody and the surveyor has given clear observation that there was no fire in the accident. Nothing has been found as burnt. As no peril in the policy is attracted in the present cases, the complainant has put up a story of explosion. Nobody has been injured in the alleged explosion. All the circumstances indicate that there was no explosion. Moreover, the state Commission has accepted the loss assessed by the surveyor and has allowed the same to the complainant in two items FA 35 of 2015 and FA 36 of 2015. Clearly neither there was any fire nor was there any explosion, still the state Commission has granted the claim to the complainant as assessed by the surveyor in these two cases. Thus, it does not matter whether there was a fire or an explosion, and the complainant would only get the same amount which the State Commission has allowed because the report of the surveyor cannot be rejected without any cogent reasons. The surveyor has assessed the loss quite logically as mentioned in the affidavits filed by the surveyor in these two items. Thus, in a way, the complaints have been allowed in these two cases by the State Commission. The fact is that the complainant is not entitled to even these amounts which have been allowed by the State Commission because the damage to the machinery was due to breakdown of the machinery and not due to any peril mentioned in the current policies. However, the insurance company has not filed appeal against these two orders because the amount involved is not very high.
11.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the AR of the appellant and the learned counsel for the respondent Insurance Company.  So far as the accidents on 27.9.2009 and 01.10.2009 are concerned, the State Commission has accepted the report of the surveyor and the loss assessed by the surveyor.  Thus, the assertion of the AR is not correct that the State Commission has not accepted the explosion as a peril.  In fact, the State Commission has observed the following:-
“33.  In the report submitted before the Police, it is simply mentioned by the complainant that fire incident occurred.  The complainant did not mention in his report that incident occurred due to explosion from charging of M.S.Scrap and sponge iron in furnace and the cause of explosion was due to mix up of some airtight closed/molded type metal container or shock absorber of motor cycle or hollow metal ball etc., with the M.S. Scrap and charged in the furnace during operation.  After heated up the container in side air expand, resulting occurred explosion.  The surveyor specifically denied occurrence of incident of the explosion, but looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that some fire incident took place in the premises of the complainant and complainant suffered loss.”
12.    From the above observation of the State Commission, it is clear that the State Commission has accepted the peril of fire and that is why allowed the compensation in terms of the surveyor’s report.
13.    So far as the First Appeal No.56 of 2015 is concerned, this accident happened on 04.10.2010 and the State Commission has observed the following:-
“31.  Shri Utkarsh Shingwekar, Surveyor gave his affidavit in which he specifically stated that he was of the opinion that there was a failure in the furnace lining, due to which the molten metal had come into contact with the coils and flown outwards, damaging and melting the coils/yokes. Shri Utkarsh Shingwekar, specifically stated there was a failure in the furnace lining and damages caused due to machine break down.  He further stated that had there been any explosion inside the furnace crucible, the molten metal would have been thrown off heavily with great pressure in various directions damaging many surrounding items. First and foremost there would have been heavy marks on the nearby walls.  The plaster was bound to peel off.
39.        Shri Utkarsh Shingwekar, Surveyor has specifically opined that there was no explosion in the Crucible No.1 and the loss was caused due to machinery breakdown which is not covered under the insurance policy.  On the basis of above facts and circumstances of the case, loss estimate of fire accident dated 04.10.2010 given by Shri Amit Kumar is not reliable and cannot be taken into considered.  On the basis of loss estimate of Shri Amit Kumar, it is not established that the complainant suffered loss to the tune of Rs.51,00422/-.  On the contrary, the surveyor mentioned in his report that there was no explosion in the crucible no.1 and incident was not covered under the Special Fire and Perils Policy therefore, the complainant is not entitled to get any compensation from O.P.”
14.    The learned counsel for the Insurance Company has stated that there was no fire seen by anybody and there was no effort to extinguish the fire.  It was only the machinery break down that is why certain machinery has been damaged.  The complainant is trying to show that the damage has happened due to explosion so that a covered peril may be proved.  The surveyor has given other observations, which clearly reflect that there was no explosion.  The State Commission has accepted these observations.  There is no force in this appeal.  The above observations of the State Commission clearly go on to show that there was no explosion in this accident.  The surveyor has accordingly not assessed any loss for this accident as it was only a machinery break down and the complainant had not taken the machinery break down policy.  The complainant had not been able to counter any of the observations made by the surveyor and the State Commission to prove the complainant’s case.  In the absence of any counter argument, I do not have any hitch in accepting the observations of the State Commission.  Accordingly, I do not find any infirmity in the order of the State Commission in CC No.14 of 2010.
15.    In respect of accident on 27.09.2009 & 01.10.2009, I have examined the report of the surveyor and the assessment made by the surveyor which was filed along with affidavits in these two cases before the State Commission as no assessment of loss was incorporated in the final survey report given by the surveyor.  Surveyor was under obligation as per duties assigned to the surveyor to assess the loss in the final survey.  For the insured, the assessment of the loss by the surveyor is very important. Though surveyor has submitted the affidavits before the State Commission where the assessment of loss has been annexed in the annexure, but this annexure is silent on many points such as:-
(i)  On what basis the prices of the individual damaged machinery have been taken?
(ii)  On what basis the depreciation of 60% on the furnace and 50% on the other items has been applied?
16.    The complainant has further agitated about the valuation of total machinery for calculating under insurance.  The AR has stated that the total machinery was of Rs.195 lacs, whereas the surveyor has taken at Rs.255 lacs, which is not correct.  The complainant has filed the balance sheet of the year ending March, 2010 to support this assertion.  The fact is that the accidents happened on 27.09.2009 and 01.10.2009, the position of the machinery would have been clear, had the complainant filed the balance sheet of the year ending March, 2009.  Thus, I would not like to enter into the realm of under Insurance and would not like to dispute the report of the surveyor in the absence of relevant balance sheet or other evidence.
","17.    From the above examination, one thing is clear that the surveyor has not rightly acted and has not properly performed task given to him.  The surveyor has omitted the assessment of the loss in the final survey report, which is a major lapse.  Though the assessment has been filed in the form of an affidavit before the State Commission, however, there are many questions which seem unanswered as examined above.  In these conditions, I am of the view that there has been deficiency on the part of the surveyor and therefore, on the part of the Insurance Company as well.  As it is not possible to have the survey again, I deem it appropriate to enhance the compensation by Rs.3,00,000/- (rupees three lakhs only) for the accident that happened on 01.10.2009 and for Rs.2,00,000/- in First Appeal No.36 of 2015 for the incident that happened on 27.09.2009, I do not find any merit in First Appeal No.56 of 2015 and the same is dismissed.
18.    Based on the above discussion, respondent Insurance Company is directed to pay Rs.3,00,000/- (rupees three lakhs only) in First Appeal No.35 of 2015 and Rs.2,00,000/- (rupees two lakhs only) in First Appeal No.36 of 2015 to the appellant over and above the amounts granted by the State Commission. These additional amounts will be paid along with 6% interest per annum from the date of order of the State Commission i.e. from 23.12.2014. This order be complied by the respondent Insurance Company within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order.  First Appeal No.35 of 2015 and First Appeal No.36 of 2015 stand disposed of accordingly.

For the Respondent No.2 :     Nemo 
","This appeal has been filed by the appellant M/s. Desai Developers & Builders Pvt. Ltd.challenging the order dated 24.07.2014 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra (in short ‘the State Commission’) in CC No.CC/02/234.
2.      Respondent No.1 filed a consumer complaint bearing No.CC/02/234 against the appellant and respondent No.2 in the year 2002.  It is the case of the appellant that the appellant filed the written version on 12.6.2003 and ultimately the matter was adjourned sine die. When the matter was taken up after taking it out from the sine die list, respondent No.1 filed an application for taking on record the changed address of the appellant on 15.07.013.  On 15.01.2014, the State Commission proceeded ex-parte against the opponent No.1/appellant herein and the matter was finally decided by the State Commission on 24.7.2014.  The State Commission allowed the consumer complaint and passed the following order:-
“1.  Opponent No.1 is held guilty of deficiency in service.
2.  Opponent No.1 shall obtain full Occupancy Certificate from the Opponent No.2 and hand-over it to the Complainant and convey the property in favour of the Complainant Society within six months from the date of this order.  In default, Opponent No.1 should pay Rs.1,000/- per day till compliance.
3.  Opponent No.1 is directed to pay to the Complainant Society, an amount of Rs.7,02,818/- on account of water charges, an amount of Rs.54,947/- on account of forfeitable deposit, an amount of Rs.6,82,650/- on account of property-tax and Rs.14,056/- towards refund of amount paid by the Members of the Complainant Society towards formation and registration of the society within six months from the date of this order.  Thus, the Opponent No.1 shall pay to the Complainant Society, a total amount of Rs.14,54,465/- together with interest thereon @9% p.a. from the date of filing of the complaint viz. 19th July, 2002 till realization. However, it is hereby made clear that if the amount is not paid within the stipulated period then, it shall carry interest @ 12% p.a.
4. Opponent No.1 shall also pay to the Complainant costs of the complaint quantified at Rs.10,000/-.
5. No order as against the Opponent No.2 as no relief was sought as against the Opponent No.2.
3.      Hence the present appeal.
4.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the written statement was filed by the appellant/opponent no.1 on 12.06.2003 and when the matter was taken up after sine die, it seems that the written statement was not available on record and State Commission again gave opportunity to both the parties to file the copies of the written statement vide its order dated 18.11.2013, which reads as under:-
“It is brought to our knowledge that written versions are filed by the opponents, but copies of the same are not on record.  Only one compilation is before the Commission.  Two sets are to be filed by the Complainant.  Opponent No.2 is ready to file copy of written version on record.  Re-issue notice to the Opponent No.1.  On appearance of the Opponent No.1, there will be clarification about the copy of written version filed by the Opponent No.1.  Hence, adjourned for return of notice to 15/01/2014.”
5.      It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that no notice was served on the appellant as the address was got changed by the complainant.   Thus, vide order dated 15.1.2014 the State Commission ordered the complaint to proceed ex-parte against the opponent no.1/appellant herein.  As the appellant was not aware of this order, therefore, this order could not be challenged.  The State Commission finally allowed the complaint vide its order dated 24.7.2014.  Thus, the order of the State Commission dated 24.7.2014 is without considering the written statement filed by the appellant.
6.      Learned counsel stated that the order dated 14.8.2003 of the Registrar reads as under:-
“Compl; absent
OP. No.1 absent
O.P.No.2 absent.  Next Date 23/10/03
Sd.
For Registrar
Messenger Shri
Vinod Prest. He stated that Co has posted
W.S. by Courier & file in registry and taken on
Record. Next date 23/10/03
Sd.
For Registrar.”
7.      From the above order, the learned counsel states that this proves that the written statement was taken on record.  The learned counsel further stated that after that opposite party no.2 also filed their written statement on 11.03.2004.  Then on 24.6.2004 Registrar has made the following noting:-
“Mrs. Archana Kakde, Adv. For Complainant, Op 1 by Mrs. F.J.Gai for Mr. J.B.Gai, A.R. Op.2 absent.  All formalities completed except rejoinder of Complainant.  For hearing adjourned to 15/10/2004.”
8.      From the above observation of the Registrar, it is clear that all the formalities were complete and only rejoinder was to be filed by the complainant.  It implies that the written statement of opponent no.1/appellant herein was already filed. The learned counsel also argued that from the observation of the State Commission dated 18.11.2013 as mentioned earlier also, it is clear that the State Commission also agreed that the written statement was filed from the side of the appellant/opposite party No.1, but the same was not available on record and the State Commission again issued notice to both the parties to file the copies of their written statement.  This notice did not reach the appellant/opposite party no.1 as the address of opposite party no.1 was got changed by the respondent no.1/complainant.  Opposite party no.2, however, filed the copy of their written statement. Vide order dated 15.1.2014, the State Commission observed the following:-
“Opponent no.1 is duly served.  However, he failed to file written version on record.  Hence, the Complaint to proceed ex-parte against the Opponent No.1.”
9.      In the above circumstances, the appellant has been proceeded ex-parte before the State Commission and its written statement has not been considered by the State Commission.  The State Commission finally allowed the complaint vide its order dated 24.07.2014.
10.    It was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that from the record and observation of the Registrar as well as of the State Commission as mentioned above, it is clear that the written statement filed by opposite party no.1 was misplaced somewhere in the State Commission and the same has not been considered by the State Commission in adjudicating the complaint in question.  The appellant should not be allowed to suffer from any lapse on the part of the Registry of the State Commission.
11.      On merits, the learned counsel for the appellant stated that the State Commission has directed the appellant to obtain the occupancy certificate and till that time to pay Rs.1,000/- per day to the complainant.  Learned counsel informed that the occupancy certificate has been obtained.  Another direction of the State Commission is in respect of registering the conveyance deed in favour of the complainant.  The learned counsel for the appellant stated that a dispute is going on between one Mr. Jhavari and the appellant in respect of the ownership of the land.  Until this dispute is decided in the civil suit which is already pending, conveyance deed cannot be registered in favour of the complainant as the tittle should be clear over the land.  In this regard, learned counsel referred to an order of the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Appeal no.331 of 1987, Surendra C. Jhavari & Ors. Vs. Bal Krishna S. Mirashi & Ors. dated 06.03.1987 and the learned counsel stated that the complainant is also a party in that civil suit and is fully aware about the pendency of the case.  It was requested by the learned counsel for the appellant that the appellant should be allowed to file the copy of the written statement before the State Commission and the matter should be decided by the State Commission after considering the written statement filed by the appellant.
12.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent no.1/complainant stated that no written statement was filed by the appellant before the State Commission as the entry by the Registry only shows that the messenger Mr.Vinod informed the Registry that written statement was sent by courier and the same was filed in the Registry. The appellant has failed to show any receipt from the Registry in this regard.  There is no clear date of filing of the written statement by the appellant/opposite party no.1 in the Registry.  The Registrar has recorded his observation only on the basis of the statement given by the messenger Mr.Vinod. Even on the subsequent dates, there is no mention of the written statement filed by the opposite party no.1.  Moreover, when the notice was given by the State Commission to file the copy of the written statement again, the appellant failed to file the same before the State Commission and thus, there was no question of considering the written statement of the appellant by the State Commission as the same was not available on record.
13.    As the matter has been finally decided by the State Commission, no purpose would be served if the matter is remanded to the State Commission after allowing the appellant to file the copy of the written statement.  It was further argued that in the light of the judgment and order dated 04.03.2020 passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.10941-10942 of 2013, New India Assurance Company Limited Vs. Hilli Multipurpose Cold Storage Pvt. Ltd., the appellant cannot be allowed to file the written statement now.  The learned counsel for the respondent No.1/complainant further stated that part of the order of the State Commission has already been complied now as stated by the learned counsel for the appellant that occupation certificate has been received. The only part remains in respect of the conveyance deed in favour of the complainant. The learned counsel stated that the deed may be conditionally registered subject to outcome of the civil suit. The learned counsel further stated that the appellant has not filed the present position of the civil suit.
14.    We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for both the parties and examined the record.  The typed copy of the order dated 14.08.2003 though reads that written statement is taken on record (as quoted by the learned counsel for the appellant above), however, the certified copy of this order as filed by the appellant does not show the last line as this seems to be a photocopy.  As the learned counsel for the respondent has not claimed the typed copy to be untrue, we take the typed copy as correct. Further orders of the Registrar particularly the order dated 24.06.2004 of the Registrar and 18.11.2013 of the State Commission give the impression that both the opposite parties had filed the written statement.  Clearly, the written statements filed by both the opposite parties were not available on record before the State Commission when the matter was taken up after taking it out from sine die list.  Inspite of notice issued, the appellant herein/opponent No.1 could not file the copy of the written statement.  It has been alleged by the appellant that the respondent No.1/complainant got address of appellant changed by submitting specific application before the State Commission and therefore, the notice was not served on the appellant.  On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.1/complainant stated that the correct address of the opposite party no.1 was informed to the State Commission and notice was sent on the correct address.  Be that as it may, the fact is that the appellant herein could not file the copy of the written statement before the State Commission and that is why State Commission could not consider its written statement.
15.    It is seen that the respondent No. 1 submitted an application for change of address of the opposite party No.1 and the new address was informed as follows:
Desai Developers and Builders private limited
Sita building 4th floor
Ram Maruti Road Dadar (West)
Mumbai 400028.
16.    The appellant has filed a letter from the complainant dated 3rd March 2011 addressed to the opposite party No.1/appellant where the address is mentioned as follows:
M/s Desai Developers and Builders private limited
1, Vidhata,
Ram Maruti Road
Dadarr (West )
Mumbai 400028
17.    In the present appeal, the address of the appellant is mentioned as 1,Vidhata, Ram Maruti Road Dadar West Mumbai which is the same as given in the application sent by the complainant to the opposite party in the year 2011. Thus, the change of address in the year 2013 seems less probable. Though the State Commission has recorded in its order dated 15.01.2014 that opponent No.1 is duly served, but no details of service have been given in this order. From these facts, we are constrained to believe that the service was not proper and therefore, the appellant could not place its earlier written statement on record before the State Commission.
","18.    From the above discussion, it is clear that the opponent No.1/ the appellant herein had filed the written statement before the State Commission and the same was taken on record, however, it was misplaced when the matter was taken up after taking the case out of the sine-die list. The notice sent by the State Commission to the appellant to submit the copy of the earlier filed written statement again on record was not properly served. In these circumstances, it seems necessary that the State Commission should pass the order in the complaint case after considering the written statement filed by the appellant. Obviously, there would arise question of delay and the appellant may have to compensate the complainant for this delay. Clearly the appellant did not pursue the complaint filed against them. Even if notice was not received by the appellant, in the normal course, a party should monitor its case before the court where it was pending. Though the appellant has taken the plea of a civil suit pending, but the copy of the order of the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay that has been filed by the appellant is not complete. Even the present status of the civil suit has not been filed by the appellant. In these circumstances we have to remand the case for final adjudication by the State Commission after considering the written statement that was filed by the appellant in the year 2003. The appellant will file that copy before the State Commission before the date of appearance before the State Commission. Thus, the impugned order dated 24.07.2014 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the State Commission. In these circumstances, this remand order is being passed at a cost of Rs. 4 lakhs [rupees four lakhs] to be paid to the complainant by the appellant/opposite party No.1 on or before date of appearance before the State Commission. However, if expedient, the State Commission will have power to extend this period by maximum 30 days if need be. It is further made clear that if the appellant does not pay the cost to the complainant or deposit the cost with the State Commission in the stipulated period, this order shall lapse and impugned order of the State Commission shall become effective.
19.     As a long delay has happened due to keeping the case in sine-die list for about 8-9 years, the State Commission is requested to finalize the complaint case as quickly as possible. Parties to appear before the State Commission on 09.11.2020.

Vide its order dated 23.04.2018, passed in three separate Consumer Complaints, the State Commission directed refund of the amount which the complainants had paid to the appellant against allotment of residential flats to them, alongwith interest @ 12% per annum, compensation quantified at Rs.1,00,000/- for mental agony and harassment and litigation expenses.   The order passed by the State Commission was to be complied by the appellant within one month from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the order.
2.      The certified copy of the order, as per the endorsement of the State Commission, was dispatched on 06.09.2018.  The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the said certified copy was received by the appellant sometime in November 2018, though the submission of the learned counsel for the complainants is that the said certified copy would have been received within a few days from the date on which it was dispatched.  The appellant did not comply with the order of the State Commission even within one month of receiving the certified copy.  Three separate appeals were instituted by the appellant before this Commission against the order which the State Commission had 23.04.2018.  The said appeals, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, were instituted some time in December 2018 but since some defects were found by the Registry in the said appeals, they came to be listed before the Bench on 31.05.2019 when this Commission stayed the above referred order dated 23.04.2018 subject to the appellant depositing the amount payable in terms of the order of the State Commission with this Commission.  The appeals came to be finally disposed of by this Commission on 26.11.2019 and the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the copy of the order of this Commission was received by them on 11.01.2020, but even the order passed by this Commission is yet to be complied.
3.      In the meanwhile, a petition u/s 7 of the IBC was admitted against the appellant company and a moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the Code was declared against it on 24.01.2019.  The said moratorium came to be lifted on 24.03.2019.
4.      Since the order passed by the State Commission had not been complied, the said Commission, vide impugned order dated 11.03.2019, convicted the appellant company u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act and sentenced it to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- in each case.  Being aggrieved from the above referred order of the State Commission, the appellant is before this Commission by way of these three separate appeals.
5.      The submission of the learned counsel for the appellant is that a moratorium against the appellant company having been declared on 24.01.2019, the order of conviction passed on 11.03.2019, during the subsistence of the said moratorium, was illegal.  He also submits that even the execution proceedings could not have continued after 24.01.2019 when the moratorium was declared.
6.      Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, to the extent it is relevant, provides that where a person against whom a complaint is made, fails or omits to comply with any order made by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, such person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month but which may extend to three years, or with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.
7.      It is not in dispute that the order passed by the State Commission in the Consumer Complaints on 23.04.2018, was not complied by the appellant company within one month of receiving its certified copy.  Though an appeal had been preferred by the appellant company against the orders passed by the State Commission on 23.04.2018, in the absence of exact date of receipt of certified copy of the order dated 23.04.2018 by the appellant company and the exact date of institution of the appeals before this Commission against the order dated 23.04.2018, it cannot be known whether the said appeal had been preferred within one month of receiving the certified copy of the order of the State Commission dated 23.04.2018 or not.  However, the fact remains that the said order was not complied within 30 days of receiving its certified copy despite there being no stay against execution of the said order.  In my opinion, the appellant company was under a legal obligation to comply with the order passed by the State Commission on 23.04.2018 after one month of receiving its certified copy, there being no stay against the said order either by this Commission or by any other Court/Forum.  The appellant company having failed to comply with the said order dated 23.04.2018, within one month of receiving its certified copy, the offence punishable u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act stood committed by it.  A reference in this regard can be made to the decision rendered by a Three-Members Bench of this Commission on 08.01.2019 in EA/80/2016 Rajnish Kumar Rohtagi & Anr. Vs. M/s. Unitech Ltd. & Anr. & connected matters whereby the larger Bench interalia held as under:
(1)     A company, or a partnership firm, which fails or omits to comply with any order made by a District Forum, State Commission or National Commission, as the case may be, will be liable to the penalty prescribed in Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act.
(2)     The date on which the order is passed by the District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be shall be deemed to be the date on which the offence under Section 27 of the C.P. Act is committed.  The said offence will be deemed to continue till the order passed by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission is complied in all respects.
8.      The question as to whether the proceedings u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be initiated against a company in respect of whom a moratorium in respect of Section 14 of the IBC has been declared or not, came up for consideration of a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in E.A. No. 25 of 2018 Lotus Panache Welfare Association Vs. M/s Granite Gate Properties Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. decided on 06.09.2019 and the following view was taken:
(i)     The proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be instituted and continued against a corporate debtor, which has failed or omitted to comply with an order passed by a Consumer Forum and in respect of whom a moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is declared by the Adjudicating Authority;
(ii)    The proceedings under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act can be instituted and continued against the persons incharge of and responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business as well as against a person referred in Para (13) hereinabove, even after a moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is declared by the Adjudicating Authority against the corporate debtor.
9.      In a recent decision in Crl. OP(MD) No.34996 of 2019, Mr. Ajay Kumar Bishnoi Vs. M/s Tap Engineering, a petition u/s 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was filed seeking quashing of the proceedings initiated against the petitioner u/s 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act on the ground that a moratorium in terms of IBC had been declared against the concerned company namely Tecpro Systems Limited.  Relying upon the decision in Indorama Synthetics (I) Ltd. Nagpur Vs. State of Maharashtra and others reported in 2016 (4) Mh. L.J. 249 and upon the order dated 02.04.2019 in Crl OP No.8869 of 2018 (M/S. Nag Leathers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. J.L. Sobhana), the Hon’ble High Court interalia held as under:

Now, the question is whether by operation of the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, the criminal prosecution initiated under Section 138 r/w.141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 r/w. 200 of Cr.Pc, can be terminated.  The categorical answer is “No”.  In JIK Industries Limited vs. Amarlal V.Jumani (2012) 3 SCC 255, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that  sanction of a scheme under Section 391 of the Companies Act, 1956 will not lead to any automatic compounding of offence under Section 138 of the Act without the consent of the complainant. Neither Section 14 nor Section 31 of the Code can produce such a result. The binding effect contemplated by Section 31 of the Code is in respect of the assets and management of the corporate debtor.   No clause in the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Plan even if accepted by the adjudicating authority/appellate Tribunal can take away the power and jurisdiction of the criminal court to conduct and dispose of the proceedings before it in CRL OP(MD). Nos.34996  of 2019 and etc., batch accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
17.     It is true that by virtue of Section 238 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. the provisions of the Code shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. But, no provision of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code bars the continuation of the criminal prosecution initiated against the corporate debtor or its directors and officials.
10.    It would thus be seen that declaration of the moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC did not come in the way of the State Commission continuing with the proceedings which the complainant had instituted against the appellant company u/s 27 of the Consumer Protection Act on account of the appellant company having failed to comply with the order of the said Commission dated 23.04.2018.
11.    The learned counsel for the appellant relies upon an order dated 01.11.2019 passed by a single Hon’ble Member of this Commission in AE/27/2019, Emaar MGF Land Ltd. Vs. Dalwinder Singh Atwal, whereby it was held that the State Commission could not have proceeded against the appellant company, during the subsistence of the moratorium declared u/s 14 of the IBC.  The said decision being contrary to the above referred decisions rendered by the larger Benches of this Commission and Madras High Court, is per incuriam, does not constitute a binding precedent and therefore, cannot be followed.
12.    The learned counsel for the appellant submits that in view of Section 238 of the IBC, the provisions of the Code have an overriding effect upon the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act.  The said submission, in my opinion, has no bearing on the issue involved in these appeals, the matter being fully covered by the above referred decisions rendered by the larger Benches of this Commission.
13.    The learned counsel for the appellant submits that though the appellant had expressed willingness to deposit the entire amount before the State Commission subject to decision of the appeal pending before the National Commission, no order by the State Commission was passed on the aforesaid offer though it was recorded in the order of the State Commission dated 11.01.2019.  The said submission, in my opinion, has absolutely no bearing on this case, the issue involved herein being as to whether the conviction of the appellant company was justified or not.
","14.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no merit in the appeals which are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.

 BEFORE:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE V.K. JAIN,PRESIDING MEMBER
  For the Petitioner     :Ms. Meghna Sankhla, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :Ch. Leela Sarveswar, Advocate
Mr. D. Srinivas, Advocate 
","Late Shri Naga Raju Prasad, husband of the complainant who was working as Superintendent in Customs & Central Excise Department of the Government obtained two policies on his life from the petitioner company.  The insurance policies were obtained on the basis on two separate proposal forms one dated 13.09.2013 and the other dated 22.10.2013.  He having died on 16.05.2014 due to cardiac arrest, the claims in terms of the insurance policies were submitted by the complainant, she being his wife.  The claims were repudiated vide letter dated 13.05.2014 which to the extent reads as under:
“Deceased life assured filled Proposal Forms for Insurance Policies and had answered following Questions in Proposal Forms:
Question No.9.Personal Medical history of the Life to be assured:
Answer the following as Yes/NO.
C. Are you at present in good health?
Answer: “Yes""
3. Have you ever suffered from any of the following diseases?
(iii) High Blood Pressure.
Answer: “No”
The deceased life assured had suppressed the material fact by not disclosing the pre-health ailment of Hypertension and the treatment taken for the disease, while filling the Proposal forms which ought to have been disclosed.
Life insurance policies are contracts governed by the principle of “UBERRIMA FIDE” and the proposer applying for insurance is expected to correctly furnish all material information regarding the health, habits, family history, personal medical history, income etc. of the life proposed for insurance by giving correct answers to the questions in the proposal form.
In this case, had we been informed correctly about the health problems of the deceased life proposed for insurance, it would have influenced our decision in issuing the policy.  As such, the contract is void, unenforceable and not legally binding on our company and we are repudiating your claim for payment of death benefit under the policy.”
2. Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim, the complainant approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.  The complaint was resisted by the petitioners primarily on the ground on which the claims had been repudiated.
","3. The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the petitioners approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The appeal was dismissed by the State Commission, the petitioner is before this Commission by way of this Revision Petition.
4. A perusal of the proposal forms would show while filling up the said proposal forms, the insured was required to answer as to whether he was ever suffering from high blood-pressure.  The answer given by him was in the negative.  A perusal of the prescription issued by ‘Help Hospitals’ to the deceased husband of the complainant would show that he was suffering from hypertension for last six years, at the said prescription was issued and he was taking Telma H one per day.  Telma H is a drug of Telmisartan and a diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide.  This is not the case of the complainant anywhere in the consumer complaint that the deceased had not suffered from hypertension at any time in the past before the proposal form was submitted by him.  Though the learned counsel for the complainant submits that at the time of submitting the proposal form, the deceased was not suffering from hypertension, no such averment is found in the complaint.  More importantly, the question in the proposal, required to disclose if he had suffered from hypertension at any point of time in his life.  The prescription of Help Hospitals dated 10.02.2014 leaves no doubt that he had been suffering from hypertension for six years.  Therefore, it cannot be disputed that no point of time he had suffered from hypertension before the proposals were submitted by him on 13.09.2013 and 22.10.2013.  The policy was, therefore, obtained by concealment of material fact with respect to the state of health of the deceased.  It is quite possible that had the state of the health of the deceased been disclosed to the insurer, either the policy would not have been granted or the insurer would have asked the proposal to undergo further medical evaluation or to pay a higher premium considering the state of his health.
5.  In LIC of India Vs. Manish Gupta – Civil Apeal No.3944 of 2019, decided on 15.04.2019, the proposal form required a disclosure as to whether the proposer had suffered from Cardiovascular disease, he responded in negative to the said question. The complainant underwent a surgery, submitted a claim  which was repudiated on the ground that he was suffering from a pre-existing illness. Upholding the repudiation of the claim, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia held as under:-
“Moreover, non-disclosure of any health event is specifically set out as a ground for excluding the liability of the insurer.”
“A contract of insurance involves utmost good faith. In Satwant Kaur Sandhu Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd., this Court has held thus:
“...Thus, it needs little emphasis that when an information on a specific aspect is asked for in the proposal form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within his knowledge. It is not for the proposer to determine whether the information sought for is material for the purpose of the policy or not. Of course, obligation to disclose extends only to facts which are known to the applicant and not to what he ought to have known. The obligation to disclose necessarily depends upon the knowledge one possesses. His opinion of the materiality of that knowledge is of no moment.”
In Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod – Civil Appeal No.4261 of 2019, decided on 24.4.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia observed as under:-
“26.    …………..It is standard practice for the insurer to set out in the application a series of specific questions regarding the applicant's health history and other matters relevant to insurability. The object of the proposal form is to gather information about a potential client, allowing the insurer to get all information which is material to the insurer to know in order to assess the risk and fix the premium for each potential client. Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries. This allows the parties to serve their interests better and understand the true extent of the contractual agreement.
The finding of a material misrepresentation or concealment in insurance has a significant effect upon both the insured and the insurer in the event of a dispute. The fact it would influence the decision of a prudent insurer in deciding as to whether or not to accept a risk is a material fact. As this Court held in Satwant Kaur (supra) “there is a clear presumption that any information sought for in the proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurane”. Each representation or statement may be material to the risk. The insurance company may still offer insurance protection on altered terms.
29.     We are not impressed with the submission that the proposer was unaware of the contents of the form that he was required to fill up or that in assigning such a response to a third party, he was absolved of the consequence of appending his signatures to the proposal. The proposer duly appended his signature to the proposal form and the grant of the insurance cover was on the basis of the statements contained in the proposal form.  …………..”
6.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order cannot be sustained and is accordingly set aside.  The consumer complaint is consequently dismissed with no order as to costs.

  For the Respondent      :For the Improvement Trust		Mr Neeraj Sharma, Advocate 
","The revision petition No.828 of 2013 has been filed by the Improvement Trust Barnala against the order dated 30.11.2012 passed by the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in Appeal no. 527 of 2008 and revision petition No. 1378 of 2013 has been filed by Rahul Bansal and Anr., against the same order dated 30.11.2012 passed by the State Commission in Appeal no. 527 of 2008.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the complainant Rahul Bansal had booked a shop with the opposite party for a total consideration of Rs.30,50,000/- and paid the booking amount of Rs.1,25,000/-.  By way of instalments, further, Rs.7,59,500/- was also paid to the opposite party. Complainant alleged that no facilities were developed around the shop and therefore, he did not pay further instalments. Due to non-payment of instalments, the opposite party cancelled the allotment vide letter dated 30.08.2007. Accordingly, the complainant filed a consumer complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Sangrur (‘the District Forum’). The complaint was resisted by the opposite party by filing written statement. However, the District Forum allowed the complaint vide its order dated 24.04.2008 as under:
“In this view of the matter, therefore, we partly allow the complaint and direct the OPs to:
To refund to the CCs an amount of Rs.8,84,000/- which was deposited towards the part payment of the price of the shop within 45 days, failing which, OPs shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the above said amount from the date of deposit of the amount, i.e., 23.02.2006 till realisation;
Pay to the CCs a sum of Rs.2,000/- on account of mental tension and harassment; and
Pay to the Cs a sum of Rs.2,000/- on account of litigation expenses.
3.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the opposite party preferred an appeal before the State Commission being FA no. 527 of 2008. The State Commission vide its order dated 30.11.2012 has partly allowed the appeal and ordered the Improvement Trust to deduct a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- being the earnest money and to refund the remaining amount of Rs.7,59,000/- along with 7.5% per annum interest.
4.     Dissatisfied by the order of the State Commission, both the parties have filed revision petitions before this Commission.
5.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the complainant states that there is no provision in the allotment letter for deduction of any earnest money, therefore, he is entitled for refund of the total amount without any deduction. The State Commission has wrongly ordered deduction of the booking amount of Rs.1,25,000/-.
6. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the opposite party states that though it is true that there is no provision in the allotment letter for deduction of earnest money, however, the allotment was cancelled as the complainant did not pay the remaining installments and to offset the loss suffered by the opposite party, deduction of earnest money of Rs.1,25,000/- has been ordered by the State Commission. Learned counsel further stated that the complainant at the first instances defaulted by not paying the installments and therefore, even if the money deposited by the complainant has to be refunded, the same should be refunded without any interest.
7.     We have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. It is an admitted fact by both sides that there is no provision of deduction/ forfeiture of earnest money in the allotment letter, therefore, the order of the State Commission for deducting the amount of Rs.1,25,000/- as earnest money is without any basis.
8.      In these circumstances, we are of the view that the refund of the total amount to the complainant is justified. The District Forum has allowed interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of refund, however, the same has been reduced to 7.5% per annum interest by the State Commission.
9. The State Commission has given a clear finding that there was no deficiency on the part of the opposite party in respect of the provision of various facilities/ amenities around the shop. In these circumstances, it is true that the complainant had stopped payment of further installments without any proper reason.
","10.   Keeping the facts and circumstances of the case in view and also taking into consideration the fact that the opposite party is a public authority, we allow that the total amount of Rs.8,84,000/- be refunded along with 6% per annum interest to the complainant from the date of respective deposits till the actual payment. The order be complied within 45 days of receipt of the order. Accordingly, both the revision petition nos. 828 and 1378 of 2013 stand disposed of.

                                                Mr. Ashu Kansal, Advocate 
  For the Respondent      :
","For the purpose of computation of the cases filed before the National Commission, the Office is directed to register the case as First Appeal and number it accordingly.
These First Appeals, under Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as “the 2019 Act”), has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. through its Resolution Professional against the Order dated 13th March, 2020, passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Delhi at New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “the State Commission”) in Complaint Cases No. 286, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306 & 307 of 2017, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants.  The State Commission by the Impugned Order has allowed the Complaints, filed by Sanjay Ahuja and other Complainants, and directed M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) to refund the entire amount received from the Complainants, including service tax alongwith compensation in the form of simple interest @ 10% p.a. from the date of each payment till the date on which entire amount alongwith compensation is refunded, with a further direction to pay ₹10,000/- as costs of litigation to each of the Complainants.  The payment was directed to be made within three months from receipt of copy of the Order.
An Application has been filed by M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) for exemption from pre-deposit of the amount, as provided under Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, which has come into force w.e.f. 20th/24th July, 2020.
The learned Counsel appearing for M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) submitted that the Appellant is not in a position to deposit the amount as contemplated under the Second Proviso to Section 51(1) of the 2019 Act. The learned Counsel further submitted that under Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act an Appeal lies to the National Commission from an Order passed in Appeal by the State Commission, where there is no requirement of pre-deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission, whereas under the Second Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act the Appellant is required to deposit fifty  percent of the amount in terms of the Order passed by the State Commission before the National Commission so that the National Commission may entertain the Appeal.  A harmonious construction of the various provisions of Section 51 of the 2019 Act has to be made and, if that is done, then the necessary corollary is that the deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission for entertaining the appeal is not mandatory but only directory in nature.
The learned Counsel also referred to and relied upon a decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors., reported in (2014) 8 SCC 657, and submitted that it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay.
We have heard the learned Counsel for the M/s Today Homes & Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (Appellant herein) and have considered the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel.
Before adverting to the various pleas raised by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, we deem it appropriate for ready reference to reproduce Section 51 of the 2019 Act:
“51. (1) Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 47 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the National Commission shall not entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of  thirty days unless it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.
(2) Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the National Commission from any order passed in appeal by any State Commission, if the National Commission is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
(3) In an appeal involving a question of law, the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal.
(4) Where the National Commission is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that question and hear the appeal on that question:
Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the National Commission to hear, for reasons to be recorded in writing, the appeal on any other substantial question of law, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question of law.
(5) An appeal may lie to the National Commission under this section from an order passed ex parte by the State Commission.”
From a perusal of Section 51 of the 2019 Act, we find that under Sub Section (1) a right of Appeal  has been given to any person who is aggrieved by the Order passed by the State Commission in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47. Sub Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub Section (1) of Section 47 deals with the powers of the State Commission to entertain Complaints only. The Appeal has to be filed within a period of thirty days of such Order. However, the First Proviso to Sub Section (1) of Section 51 gives the discretion to the National Commission to entertain the Appeal even after the period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period meaning that it has the power to condone the delay in filing the Appeal beyond thirty days. The Second Proviso to sub Section (1) of Section 51 provides  that the Appeal shall not be entertained by the National Commission of the person who is required to pay any amount in terms of the Order of the State Commission unless fifty percent of that amount has been deposited.
Sub-Section (2) of Section 51 of the 2019 Act provides a second Appeal to be preferred before the National Commission in an order passed by the State Commission in Appeal.  However, the second Appeal should involve a substantial question of law. Sub Section 3 to 5 of Section 51 are not being referred to as they are not relevant for deciding the issue involved in these cases.
In our considered opinion the intention of the Parliament while enacting 2019 Act is that if the Complaint has been decided by any one forum then the person who has been directed to pay certain amount should deposit fifty percent of that amount if a first Appeal is being filed before the next forum.  The provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 deals with the First Appeal being filed before the National Commission against an Order passed by the State Commission in the Complaint Case and, therefore, there is a requirement of deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.
We may mention here that similar provision has been made by the Parliament in Section 41 of the 2019 Act, which provides for preferring an appeal against an order passed by the District Forum before the State Commission.  For ready reference, Section 41 is reproduced below:
“41. Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Commission may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty-five days from the date of the order, in such form and manner, as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of forty-five days, if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Commission, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed:
Provided also that no appeal shall lie from any order passed under sub-section (1) of section 81 by the District Commission pursuant to a settlement by mediation under section 80.”
Likewise, under Section 67 of the 2019 Act, a provision has been made for filing an Appeal before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against an order passed by the National Commission under Sub-Clause (i) or (ii) of Clause (a) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 58, which deals with the orders passed in the Complaint Cases.  The Second Proviso of Section 67 also requires deposit of 50% of the amount awarded by the National Commission before the Appeal can be entertained by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  For ready reference, Section 67 of the 2019 Act is reproduced below:
“67. Any person, aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission in exercise of its powers conferred by sub-clause (i) or (ii) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 58, may prefer an appeal against such order to the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of the order:
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the National Commission shall be entertained by the Supreme Court unless that person has deposited fifty per cent. of that amount in the manner as may be prescribed.”
From a reading of the aforesaid provisions, it is absolutely clear that the Parliament wanted to make it mandatory for the Opposite Party in the Complaint Case to deposit a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded by the Consumer Fora/Commissions while preferring First Appeal.
So far as the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Shreenath Corp. & Ors. Vs. Conum. Educ. & Res. Society & Ors. (Supra), relied upon by the learned Counsel, is concerned, we may mention here that in Paragraph-11 and 12 of the said decision, the Apex Court has held that unless the Appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the Appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission.  Paragraphs 11 and 12are reproduced below for ready reference:
“11. The second proviso to Section 19 of the Act mandates pre-deposit for consideration of an appeal before the National Commission. It requires 50% of the amount in terms of an order of the State Commission or 35,000/- whichever is less for entertainment of an appeal by the National Commission. Unless the appellant has deposited the pre-deposit amount, the appeal cannot be entertained by the National Commission. A pre-deposit condition to deposit 50% of the amount in terms of the order of the State Commission or Rs.35,000/- being condition precedent for entertaining appeal, it has no nexus with the order of stay, as such an order may or may not be passed by the National Commission. Condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals.
(Underlined by us)
12. It is not the case of any of the appellants that the Consumer Forum including State and National Commissions has no power to pass interim order of stay. If the National Commission after hearing the appeal of the parties in its discretion wants to stay the amount awarded, it is open to the National Commission to pass an appropriate interim order including conditional order of stay. Entertainment of an appeal and stay of proceeding pursuant to order impugned in the appeal stands at different footings, at two different stages. One (pre-deposit) has no nexus with merit of the appeal and the other (grant of stay) depends on prima facie case; balance of convenience and irreparable loss of party seeking such stay.”
(Underlined by us)
Thus, the condition for pre-deposit of 50% awarded by the State Commission in Complaint Case in an Appeal preferred before the National Commission is mandatory. As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Shreenath Corp. & Others (Supra) in paragraph 11 reproduced above condition of pre-deposit is there to avoid frivolous appeals. This Commission cannot entertain any Appeal unless the concerned Appellant has deposited 50% of the amount awarded by the State Commission.  There is no provision in the 2019 Act, empowering the National Commission to waive, relax or reduce the amount to be deposited under the Second Proviso, referred to above.  The present First Appeals are, therefore, defective for want of pre-deposit of the fifty percent of the amount directed by the State Commission in the impugned Order, which has not been made by the Appellant.
","          Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.     
Accordingly, the First Appeals cannot be entertained and are hereby dismissed.

  For the Petitioner     :MS. ROSY SHARMA 
  For the Respondent      :Mr Rakshit Jain, Advocate, Proxy Counsel for
		Mr Shubhranshu Padhi, Advocate 
","PER MR PREM NARAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER
This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner Piara Ram against the order dated 21.07.2017 passed by the Punjab State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh (‘the State Commission’) in First Appeal no. 141 of 2017.
2.     The brief facts of the case are that the vehicle (Cab Marka Tempo Traveller) of the petitioner bearing no. PB 01 5345 was insured with the respondent/ insurance company for period 14.12.2014 to 12.12.2015. During the currency of the policy (Policy no. 401803/31/14/6300009732) the said vehicle met with an accident on 11.12.2015. A surveyor was appointed by the insurance company who assessed the loss at Rs.76,065/-. Complainant submitted a bill for Rs.1,64,000/- as an insurance claim, however, the insurance company denied the claim vide its letter no. 745 dated 12.07.2016 on the ground that the policy conditions were violated.
3.     The complainant then filed a consumer complaint no.85 of 2016 before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (‘the District Forum’). The insurance company contested the complaint and stated that the claim was not payable as there was no endorsement in the driving licence of the driver for driving a commercial vehicle.
4.     The District Forum however, allowed the complaint and directed the insurance company to pay Rs.1,64,000/- with damages of Rs.5,000/- and litigation expenses of Rs.3,000/-.
5.     Aggrieved by the order of the District Forum, the insurance company preferred an appeal being FA no.141 of 2017 before the State Commission.
6.     The State Commission accepted the appeal vide its order dated 21.07.2017 and dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no endorsement on the driving licence of the driver for driving a commercial vehicle (maxicab).
7.     Hence the present revision petition.
8.     Heard the learned counsel for both the parties and perused the material on record. Learned counsel for the petitioner has stated that the State Commission has wrongly observed that an endorsement was required on the driving licence of the driver to drive a maxicab. In fact, no such endorsement is required and a normal LMV driving licence is sufficient to permit a person to drive a maxicab. The learned counsel further stated that the State Commission has relied on the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of New India Assurance Co. Ltd., vs Prabhu Lal – 2008 (1) RCR (Civil) 198 as well as the provision of Rule 7 of “Rent a Cab Scheme 1989” of the Punjab Government wherein it is mandated that the driver of a maxicab will have an endorsement on his driving licence for driving a maxicab. Learned counsel has argued that the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co. Ltd., vs Prabhu Lal (Supra) is in respect of transport vehicle and not specifically on the maxicab. Similarly, the provision of rule 7 of the scheme is against the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mukund Dewangan vs Oriental Insurance Company Limited – Civil Appeal no. 5826 of 2011 decided on 03.07.2017 wherein it has been categorically clarified that no endorsement is required on the LMV Licence for driving a maxicab. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as under:
“46. Section 10 of the Act requires a driver to hold a licence with respect to the class of vehicles and not with respect to the type of vehicles. In one class of vehicles, there may be different kinds of vehicles. If they fall in the same class of vehicles, no separate endorsement is required to drive such vehicles. As light motor vehicle includes transport vehicle also, a holder of light motor vehicle licence can drive all the vehicles of the class including transport vehicles. It was pre-amended position as well the post-amended position of Form 4 as amended on 28.3.2001. Any other interpretation would be repugnant to the definition of “light motor vehicle” in section 2(21) and the provisions of section 10(2)(d), Rule 8 of the Rules of 1989, other provisions and also the forms which are in tune with the provisions. Even otherwise the forms never intended to exclude transport vehicles from the category of ‘light motor vehicles’ and for light motor vehicle, the validity period of such licence hold good and apply for the transport vehicle of such class also and the expression in Section 10(2)(e) of the Act ‘Transport Vehicle’ would include medium goods vehicle, medium passenger motor vehicle, heavy goods vehicle, heavy passenger motor vehicle which earlier found place in section 10(2)(e) to
(h) and our conclusion is fortified by the syllabus and rules which we have discussed. Thus we answer the questions which are referred to us thus:
(i) ‘Light motor vehicle’ as defined in section 2(21) of the Act would include a transport vehicle as per the weight prescribed in section 2(21) read with section 2(15) and 2(48). Such transport vehicles are not excluded from the definition of the light motor vehicle by virtue of Amendment Act No.54/1994.
(ii) A transport vehicle and omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of either of which does not exceed 7500 kg. would be a light motor vehicle and also motor car or tractor or a road roller, ‘unladen weight’ of which does not exceed 7500 kg. and holder of a driving licence to drive class of “light motor vehicle” as provided in section 10(2)(d) is competent to drive a transport vehicle or omnibus, the gross vehicle weight of which does not exceed 7500 kg. or a motor car or tractor or road-roller, the “unladen weight” of which does not exceed 7500 kg. That is to say, no separate endorsement on the licence is required to drive a transport vehicle of light motor vehicle class as enumerated above. A licence issued under section 10(2)(d) continues to be valid after Amendment Act 54/1994 and 28.3.2001 in the form.
(iii) The effect of the amendment made by virtue of Act No.54/1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 while substituting clauses (e) to (h) of section 10(2) which contained “medium goods vehicle” in section 10(2)(e), medium passenger motor vehicle in section 10(2)(f), heavy goods vehicle in section 10(2)(g) and “heavy passenger motor vehicle” in section 10(2)(h) with expression ‘transport vehicle’ as substituted in section 10(2)(e) related only to the aforesaid substituted classes only. It does not exclude transport vehicle, from the purview of section 10(2)(d) and section 2(41) of the Act i.e. light motor vehicle.
(iv) The effect of amendment of Form 4 by insertion of “transport vehicle” is related only to the categories which were substituted in the year 1994 and the procedure to obtain driving licence for transport vehicle of class of “light motor vehicle” continues to be the same as it was and has not been changed and there is no requirement to obtain separate endorsement to drive transport vehicle, and if a driver is holding licence to drive light motor vehicle, he can drive transport vehicle of such class without any endorsement to that effect”.
9.     On the other hand the learned counsel for the respondent insurance company stated that the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mukund Dewangan vs Oriental Insurance Company Limited (supra) is now being reviewed by a larger Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s Bajaj Alliaance General Insurance Co. Ltd., vs Rambha Devi and Ors., in Civil Appeal no.841 of 2018 as would be clear from the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 03.05.2018 wherein the following has been observed:
“While the counsel have referred to various other provisions of the Act and the Rules, we have only referred to a few, very significant submissions. Since, the prayer is for the reconsideration of Mukund Dewangan (supra), we are of the view that it is only appropriate that the prayer itself, in light of some of the submissions we have noted above, be considered by a larger Bench of three Judges”.
10.   Learned counsel for the respondent has further stated that if the claim of the petitioner is allowed, the same can only be allowed to the extent of loss assessed by the surveyor which is Rs.76,065/-. The District Forum has wrongly allowed the total claim submitted by the complainant and has ignored the report of the surveyor without any basis. The surveyors are appointed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938 and their report cannot be brushed aside without any cogent reasons. No reasons have been given by the District Forum for not accepting the report of the surveyor. Hence, if the claim has to be settled the same can only be settled on the basis of the report of the surveyor.
11.   I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined the record. The question of the endorsement has been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Mukund Dewangan vs Oriental Insurance Company Limited (Supra). This is the currently ruling judgment even though the review by a larger bench has been recommended. Learned counsel for the respondent/ insurance company has informed that there is no stay of the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Mukund Dewangan vs Oriental Insurance Company Limited (Supra). Hence, in the interest of speedy justice, I would like to rely on the above judgment in the case of Mukund Dewangan vs Oriental Insurance Company Limited. As per this judgment, there is no requirement of endorsement for driving a maxicab on the LMV licence. The objection of the State Commission on the basis of the provisions of the “Rent a Cab Scheme” is also not valid, once, there is no legal requirement for having the endorsement on the LMV Licence for driving a maxicab.
12.   Clearly, on the basis of the above discussion, the petitioner/ complainant is entitled to get the insurance claim. When the surveyor has been appointed by the insurance company and the surveyor has submitted his report wherein damage has been assessed at Rs.76,065/-, the insurance claim is to be settled on the basis of the surveyor’s report only unless there are cogent reasons to reject the same. The District Forum has not considered the report of the surveyor and has not given any specific reason for not considering or rejecting the same even though the opposite party had mentioned in their written reply submitted before the District Forum that if the Forum reaches to a conclusion to allow the insurance claim, the liability of the insurance company should be limited to a maximum of Rs.76,065/- which is the loss assessed by the surveyor. In my view, the petitioner’s claim can only be settled at Rs.76,065/- which is the loss assessed by the surveyor.
13.   Based on the above discussion, the revision petition no. 3377 of 2017 is partly allowed and the respondent insurance company is directed to pay Rs.76,065/- along with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of District Forum’s order, i.e., 09.01.2017 till the actual payment.

FA/263/2014
The complainant company is engaged in the business of selling gold and diamond jewellery and the company had taken an insurance policy from the appellant which interalia covered theft of jewelley belonging to the complainant / respondent. An FIR was lodged by Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta,  Director of the complainant company on 23.12.2004 alleging therein that when he came to his showroom at Gurudwara Road, Karol Bagh, New Delhi at about 11.55 a.m.  in his Scorpio car accompanied by  his employees namely, Chetan Sharma and Dharmender, he was carrying two briefcases, the colours of which were Grey and Maroon. He got down from the car carrying grey briefcase with him. Marron colour briefcase containing jewellery was left in the car. His employees started opening the showroom of the company, whereas his driver Ram Khiladi who had come driving another car and his Manager  Neeraj Gupta stood near the car . The complainant then asked his employee  Ishwar Chand Sharma to bring briefcase from the car. When Ishwar Chand reached the car, the briefcase of Maroon colour containing jewellery was found missing.
2.      On the same day, Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta  gave a handwritten letter to the concerned SHO at about 6.15 p.m. in which he alleged theft of two briefcases both containing jewellery from the car. It was stated in the said letter that when the informant was standing outside the shop/showroom, and the employee was opening the shop/showroom, a tall person blocked his view and on enquiry he made some useless queries  to justify his presence. At the same time, another person engaged his driver by enquiring about a post office and a third person pushed his broker Neeraj away. When the informant asked his employees to take out the briefcases, both the briefcases were found stolen.
3.      It would thus be seen that there are following material contradictions  between the versions given in the FIR and the version given in the letter, though both the FIR as well as the letter emanated from the same person, namely,  Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta:-
In the FIR, it was clearly stated that the Grey briefcase was carried by Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta with him when he got down from the car. On the other hand, in the letter given at 6.15 p.m. on the same day, he claimed that both the briefcases i.e. Grey briefcase as well as the Maroon briefcase were left in the car.
Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta specifically alleged theft of only Maroon briefcase in the FIR. On the other hand, he alleged theft of both Grey as well as Maroon briefcases in the letter given in the evening.
Mr. Neeraj was described as Manager in the FIR whereas he was described as a broker in the letter given in the evening.
The FIR gives an impression as if the articles of jewellery were kept only in the Maroon briefcase whereas in the letter given in the evening, it was claimed that both the briefcases contained jewellery.
In the FIR, there is no allegation that a second person had diverted the attention of the driver by asking him about the post office and the third person had pushed Mr. Neeraj. These averments find mention only in the letter given in the evening. However, the averment regarding a tall person being present near the shop/showroom of the complainant finds mention in both the FIR as well as the letter.
4.            I have carefully perused the consumer complaint. No explanation has been given by the complainant for the material  contradictions as noted hereinabove, between the FIR and the letter given in the evening. The learned counsel for the complainant/respondent submits that the FIR was lodged as per the dictation  of the police officer. However, no such averment is found either in the letter given in the evening or in the consumer complaint. Therefore, the oral submission made by the learned counsel cannot be accepted.
5.            In my opinion, had the two briefcases both containing jewellery are stolen as is the case made out in the letter given in the evening, Mr. Sachin Vijay Gupta would not have alleged theft of only one briefcase in the FIR lodged by him at the police station. The police officer had nothing to gain by persuading the informant to claim theft of jewellery kept in one briefcase since FIR was duly registered by the concerned police station, it would make no difference to them whether the jewellery was kept in one briefcase or it was kept in two briefcases. Either way the offence made out  would be one and the same.
6.            Therefore, I am unable to accept the version given by the complainant in the letter given by him in the evening of the incident. It appears to me that the letter given in the evening was an after thought, given after due planning and was motivated in order to make a higher claim and seek  a higher compensation from the insurer. The aforesaid material contradiction between the FIR and the letter given in the evening which go to the root of the material was conveniently ignored  by the surveyor without even asking the complainant to give an explanation for those variations. In my opinion, the theft of the second bag from the case does stand duly proved. The Insurer therefore was justified in paying only a sum of Rs.15 lakhs to the complainant.
7.           Though this is also the submission of the learned counsel for the Insurer that having voluntarily executed the Discharge Voucher of Rs.15 lakhs before receiving the said amount from the insurer, the complainant is estopped  from claiming any further amount from the Insurer, I need not go into this question. On merits the complainant has not been able to substantiate the claim to the extent it has not been paid. The learned counsel for the petitioner relies upon the decision in M/s. K N Resourses Pvt. Ltd. Versus  Divisional Manager/Regional Manager, Oriental Insurance co. Ltd., - Consumer Case No. 1247 of 2016 decided on 01/03/2019, United India Insurance Vs. Ajmer Singh Cotton & General Mills & Ors., [II (1999) CPJ 10 (SC)] & New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Genus Power Infrastructure Ltd., [(2015) 2 SCC 424]. However, I need not examine those judgements since the case of complainant with respect to the theft of the second bag does not stand otherwise proved.
","8.           For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned order is set aside and the consumer complaint is consequently dismissed with no order as to costs.
9.           The amount of statutory deposit be refunded to the appellant alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount. The amount, if any, deposited by the appellant with the State Commission  shall also be refunded to the appellant alongwith interest which may have accrued on that amount.

  For the Respondent      :
","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The case of the complainant in nutshell is that it purchased a pre-owned Audi Car for a consideration of Rs.61,50,000/- for the use of its Directors. This is also the case of the complainant that though the car had been manufactured in the year 2015, it was represented to it in the documents that the car had been manufactured in the year 2016. The complainant, therefore, engaged the services of a valuer M/s Vision Squad Service Pvt. Ltd. who assessed the valuation of the said car at Rs.44 lakhs. The complainant, therefore, suffered a loss of Rs.17,50,000/-. The complainant thus approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.
2.      The petitioner did not appear before the District Forum and its right to file the written version, therefore, was closed. The District Forum  having allowed the consumer complaint, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission way of an appeal. Vide impugned order dated 20.2.2020,  the State Commission dismissed the appeal thereby maintaining the order of the District Forum  directing the petitioner to pay the difference in the value of the car, i.e., Rs.17,50,000/- alongwith interest @ 9% p.a. and also awarded compensation of Rs.20,000/-. Being dissatisfied, the petitioner is before this Commission.
3.      The submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner are twofold. His first submission is that the complainant company was engaged in the business of purchasing and selling pre-owned cars as would be evident from the legal notice which the complainant had sent. His second submission is that the car was purchased from another company, namely, M/s Land Mark Pre-owned Cars Pvt. Ltd.  which is an  entity different from the petitioner company.
4.      As far as his first submission is concerned, the case of the complainant is that the car in question was purchased by it for the use of its Directors. If the car was purchased for the personal use of the Directors of the company it  cannot be said to be that it was purchased for the commercial purpose. A reference in this regard can be made to the decision of a Three-Member Bench of this Commission in CC No. 51/2006 Crompton Greaves Ltd. and Anr. Vs. Daimler Chrysler India Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. and the following view was taken:-
“Noticing an apparent conflict in the decisions rendered by this Commission in Controls and Switchgear Company Ltd. Vs. Daimler Chrysler India Pvt. Ltd. and T and T Motors Ltd. IV (2007) CPJ 1 (NC) and General Motors Pvt. Ltd. Vs. G.S. Fertilizers Pvt. Ltd. [First Appeal No. 723 of 2006] decided on 07.02.2013, both rendered by Benches comprising two Members, the following issue was referred to this larger Bench, for decision:-
Whether the purchase of a car or any other goods by a company for the use/personal use of its Director amounts to purchase for a commercial purpose, within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, or not.
11.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, the issue referred to the larger Bench is answered as follows:-
(a) If a car or any other goods are obtained or any services are hired or availed by a company for the use/personal use of its directors or employees, such a transaction does not amount to purchase of goods or hiring or availing of services for a commercial purpose, irrespective of whether the goods or services are used solely for the personal purposes of the directors or employees of the company or they are used primarily for the use of the directors or employees of the company and incidentally for the purposes of the company.
(b) The purchase of a car or any other goods or hiring or availing of services by a company for the purposes of the company amount to purchase for a commercial purpose, even if such a car or other goods or such services are incidentally used by the directors or employees of the company for their personal purposes.
5.      The broader issue was re-examined by another Three-Member Bench of this Commission recently in CC No. 349 of 2017 Springdale Core Consultants Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Pioneer Urbandland and Infrastructure Ltd.  and the following view was taken:-
8.     It would thus be seen that the legal status of the buyer be it a company, a partnership firm, a society, an Association of Persons or an individual is not relevant for deciding whether the buyer is a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act or not, the relevant factor being the purpose for which the residential plot / house is bought or booked by the buyer.  If a house / residential plot is booked or purchased by a company for the personal residential use of the employees of the company, the purchase / booking is not linked to the regular profit generating business activities of the company, and therefore it cannot be said that the residential plot/house is bought or booked by the company for a commercial purpose.  A company purchasing or booking a residential plot / house will be out of the purview of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act only if there is a close and direct nexus between the purchase / booking of the house / residential plot and the regular business activities of the said company.  The view taken by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in respect of the purchase of residential house by a Trust for its employees working in a Hospital being run by a Trust as a part of its commercial activities shall equally apply to the residential plot / house purchased / booked by a company for the residential use of its Directors, the determining factor being the purpose behind such purchase / booking and the legal status of the purchaser being immaterial.  Though, a company is not obliged by law to provide residential accommodation to its Directors, the same being the legal position with respect to its employees, it would be wholly immaterial whether the residential plot / house is intended to be used for the residence of the employees or of the Directors of the company.
The acquisition of a residential plot or house by a company, for being used as a residence of its directors or employees does not have a close and direct nexus with the regular business activities of the company, is not essential for the business activities of the company, does not aid, assist or promote its business and does not generate any business revenue or profit for the corporate. It is only a perquisite provided by the company to its Directors or employees, and may or may not form an integral part of their terms of employment or appointment, as the case may be.
9.     However if a residential plot / house is purchased / booked by a company as a part of its regular profit generating commercial activities and not for being used as the residence of its Directors / or employees such a purchase / booking would be for a commercial purpose and therefore, the company would not be a consumer, as far as such a purchase / booking is concerned.
10.   For the reasons stated hereinabove, and in view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Lilavati Kirtilal Mehta Medical Trust (supra), the reference is answered as follows:
1.     It is the purpose for which the residential plot / house is booked / purchased, which is material for determining whether the purchaser is a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The legal status of the purchaser, be it an individual, a partnership, an Association of Persons, a Trust, a Society or a Company is immaterial for such determination.
2.     If a house / residential plot is booked / purchased by a company for the residential use of its Directors / employees the company will be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, as far as such a booking / purchase is concerned.
3.    If a house / residential plot is bought / booked by a company as a part of its business activities and such purchase / booking has a close and direct nexus with the regular profit generating activities of the company, it will not be a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act as far as such a purchase / booking is concerned.”
The view taken by this Commission in Springdale Core (Supra) would equally apply to the purchase of a vehicle by a company or a partnership firm.”
5.      As regards the second submission, admittedly the petitioner is a group company since two shareholders of the petitioner company are stated to be also the shareholders of other company, namely, M/s Land Mark Pre-owned Cars Pvt. Ltd.  The petitioner having not filed any written version and having not taken any objection in this regard, I am not inclined to entertain this plea at the stage of revision petition. In any case, nothing prevents the petitioner from paying to the complainant and then recovering the money from the other company, both of them being a company belonging to the same group.
6.      The seller of the car misrepresented to the complainant by claiming that the car had been manufactured in the year 2016 whereas it was manufactured in the year 2015. Obviously, the complainant would not have paid the same price for the car had it known that the car had been manufactured in the year 2015 and not in the year 2016.  A valuer had thereafter assessed the value of the car sold to the complainant and the said valuation has gone unrebutted, the petitioner having not contested the consumer complaint by filing the written version.
","6.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, I find no merit in the revision petition which is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs.

","This review application has been filed by the opposite party for the review of the order dated 29.03.2019 passed in CC no. 683 of 2016. The following is operative portion of the order:
“The opposite parties shall refund the amount of Rs.1,14,77,831/- to the complainant along with 9% per annum interest from the date of respective deposits till actual payment. The order be complied by the opposite parties within 3 months from the date of receipt/ service of the order.”
2.     Heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record.
3.     Learned counsel for the review applicant/ opposite party states that the amount mentioned in the order as Rs.1,14,77,831/- is not the amount that has been deposited by the complainant with the opposite party, as this amount includes the amount of Rs.25 lakh in respect of return on investment. Therefore, the amount of Rs.25 lakh should be deducted from this amount. On the other hand the learned counsel for the complainant states that this amount has been accepted by the opposite party vide their e-mail dated 04.03.2014 wherein statement of account was sent by the opposite party to the complainant. This statement of account clearly shows that the total amount paid was Rs.1,14,77,831/-. There is no reason to modify the order.
4.     I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the record. It seems that both the parties have agreed for the amount of Rs.1,14,77,831/- that has been taken on the basis of the statement of account given by the opposite party which was sent by e-mail by the opposite party dated 04.03.2014. In this statement of account, Rs.25 lakh has been mentioned as return of investment and this amount has been given by the builder as adjustment in the statement of account. Clearly this amount was actually not paid by the complainant to the opposite party and this amount is not required to be refunded as per the order of this Commission. Accordingly, the order dated 29.03.2019 is modified to the extent that the amount of Rs.1,14,77,831/- will be substituted by Rs.89,77,831/-.
5.     Earlier, three months’ time was given for making payment, as sometime has already passed and the opposite party has not deposited the amount of Rs.90,00,000/- (Rupees ninety lakh only) which was ordered to be deposited on 24.05.2019 passed by this Commission, therefore, now 30 days’ time is granted to make the payment of Rs.89,77,831/- (rupees eighty nine lakh seventy seven thousand eight hundred thirty one only) as per the order of this Commission along with 9% per annum interest as ordered by this Commission on 29.03.2019.
","6.     This order will be part of the order dated 29.03.2019 passed in CC no. 683 of 2016. Accordingly, the review application stands disposed of.

The present appeal has been filed by Shri Rajendra Singh and Usha, who were opposite party nos. 1 & 2 in the complaint filed by respondent no.1 Smt. Neela, the complainant.  During the pendency of the present appeal, appellant no.1, namely, Rajendra Singh (opposite party no.1 before the State Commission) had settled the matter with the
-2-
complainant and vide IA No. 15055 of 2019 has made a prayer that settlement deed be brought on record.
2.      Vide impugned order dated 09.08.2018 in CC No.1/2014, the State Commission has held both the appellants i.e. Rajendra Singh and Usha jointly and severally liable.  Since Rajendra Singh has settled its liability qua the complainant and does not press his appeal, the appeal qua him stands dismissed as withdrawn.
3.      This Commission, therefore, now deals with this appeal as if it has been filed by OP No.2, namely, Usha.
4.      The admitted facts of the case are that complainant is widow of Shri Suresh Nair who had expired in the year 2008. She wanted to purchase the house and was offered flat at ground floor in the proposed building Shri Balaji Apartments situated at plot No.16, Mouza Zingbai Takali in the layout of Utkarsha Griha Nirman Sahakari Santhan Ltd., Ward No.61, Nagpur.  Opposite parties no.1 & 2 initially sold this flat to opposite parties no. 3 & 4 vide agreement to sell dated 29.12.2007. It is interesting to note that opposite party no.3 is sister of Rajendra Singh and opposite party No.4 is her husband.  No sale deed was executed in favour of opposite parties no.3 & 4 by them. Despite the fact that already
-3-
an agreement to sell had been executed with opposite party nos. 3 & 4 relating to ground floor flat in the said apartment, the same flat was offered for sale to the complainant.  The reason that opposite parties no. 3 & 4 refused to enter into a sale deed was that they on inquiry had found that no sanction was given for the construction of the ground floor by the appropriate authority and was meant to be used for meter room and as parking space. It was also represented to the complainant that property was free from encroachment, attachment, right in favour of any third party etc.  Since there was no sanction of the ground floor, ground floor was demolished by the concerned authorities.  Complainant felt cheated and, thereafter, filed complaint.  The defence taken by Usha before the State Commission was that before the execution of the sale deed, complainant had verified all the documents relating to the ground floor premises and after being satisfied, she had executed the sale deed.
5.      It is argued by the Appellant that complaint was barred by limitation since sale deed was executed in favour of the complainant / respondent no.1 in the year 2010 and possession was handed over to her and she continued to occupy the said ground floor for 3 ½ year and all of a sudden had filed the present appeal. It is further argued that i-impugned order is liable to be set aside.  It is further submitted that
-4-
respondent nos. 2 & 3 ( opposite parties no. 3 & 4 before the State Commission) are also jointly and severally liable since they were the consenting parties and had entered into an agreement with appellant no.2.  It is argued that they have been wrongly exonerated by the State Commission.
6.      Parties led their evidences before the State Commission and after hearing the arguments of learned counsel for the parties, impugned order had been passed whereby respondent nos. 2 & 3 (opposite parties nos. 3 & 4 ) were exonerated of any liability and liability was fixed on the appellants.
7.      I have heard the arguments and perused the relevant record.  The admitted facts are that construction of the ground floor in the building named Balaji Apartments was in violation of the sanctioned plan.  This fact is not disputed by any of the appellant.  It is also an admitted fact that initially this floor was offered for sale and agreement to purchase was entered into between the appellants and respondent nos. 2 & 3 (opposite parties nos. 3 & 4 ) but respondent  nos. 2 & 3 (opposite parties nos. 3 & 4 ) refused to enter into any sale deed on finding out that ground floor was an illegal construction.  All of them thereafter d-5-uped   the  complainant  and  sold that  illegal   construction  to  the
-5-
complainant for consideration.  Even sale deed was executed in her favour and she continued occupying it  till the time she received a notice from the concerned authorities on 18.03.2013 informing  her that since construction was an illegal construction, it was to be demolished.  Subsequent to that notice, ground floor was demolished by the appropriate authorities.  Cause of action thus arose on the date when complainant received the notice of demolition by the appropriate authorities and again on the date when the property in dispute was demolished. This happened in the year 2013 and the complaint was filed in 2014. Therefore, complaint was within period of limitation.  As regards the deficiency in service is concerned, it is apparent from the above facts which remains duly proved on record and are undisputed that there was gross deficiency on the part of the appellants.  They despite the fact that property was unauthorised, sold it to the complainant for consideration.
8.      It is also apparent that opposite party nos. 3 & 4 had signed the concerned document executing in favour of the complainant as a consenter and they had not sold the property to her.  They were also not the owner of the said property. They were required to give consent to the sale of property to the complainant since initially an agreement for sale was executed by appellant with them.  It is clear that they were also
-6-
duped in by the appellants as agreement to sale was also executed with them.  It was only when they learnt that property was unauthorised they refused to buy it. The State Commission, therefore, has rightly exonerated them as there was no privity of contract between the complainant and them.
","9.      From the above discussion, it is apparent that present appeal  has no  merit. Same is dismissed qua appellant no.2 i.e. Usha.   Order of the State Commission dated 09.08.2018 qua appellant no.2 i.e.  Usha stands confirmed.  Since appellant no.1 Mr. Rajendera Singh has entered into a settlement with the complainant and had  filed a settlement deed, which is confirmed by the complainant who is present in person in the Commission,  the impugned order of the State Commission can be said to stand satisfied qua Mr. Rajendra Singh.
10.    With these observations, present appeal stands disposed of.

This revision petition is directed against the order of the State Commission dated 27.09.2010 whereby the appeal preferred by the respondents against the order of the District Forum was allowed and consequently the consumer complaint filed by the petitioner was dismissed.
2.      The petitioner/complainant had purchased a shop in Sector 13-17 of Panipat in an open auction.  His grievance before the District Forum was that the possession had been offered to him without completing all the development work in the area.
3.      The District Forum allowed the complaint with the following order:-
“For the reasons recorded above, we accept the present complaint and direct the OPs not to charge any possession interest from the petitioner with respect of the (DS) Shop No. 10, Sector 13-17, HUDA, Panipat till the completion of the basic amenities at the spot and further we direct to the OPs to withdraw the letter bearing no. 3617 dated 25.10.2005 as the petitioner is not liable to pay the possession interest till the completion of the basic amenities at the spot.  The Ops are further directed to pay Rs. 10000/- as compensation for mental harassment and Rs. 3300/- as litigation expenses. The OPs shall make the compliance of this order within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order.  Parties concerned be communicated of the order accordingly and file be consigned to the records after due compliance.”
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the District Forum, the respondent approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal and submitted that the complainant was not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.  The said contention was accepted by the State Commission and consequently the consumer complaint was dismissed.
5.      This Commission vide its order dated 28.02.2011 agreed with the view taken by the State Commission in this regard and held that having purchased the shop in an auction the petitioner was not a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  Reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in UT Chandigarh Administration & Anr. Vs. Amarjeet Singh & Ors. – (2009) 4 SCC 660.
","6.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by this Commission, the petitioner approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court by way of Civil Appeal No. 1121 of 2012.  The appeal was disposed of by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 30.10.2018 which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:-
1. We do not consider it necessary for the purpose of disposal of the case to go into the correctness of the view expressed by a two-judge Bench of this Court in UT Chandigarh Administration and another Vs. Amarjeet Singh and others.   According to us, the matter is capable of resolution on a shorter point.
2. The grievance of the appellants is with regard to the completion of the development works which the  Authority issuing the allotment i.e. HUDA, under the terms of the allotment letter, is obliged to complete. While there is an assertion on the part of the respondent – HUDA that development works have been carried out, the said fact is being disputed.
3. In the aforesaid circumstances, without creating a precedent and without entering into any discussion on the correctness of the views expressed in UT Chandigarh Administration and another Vs. Amarjeet Singh and others (supra)  we permit the appellants to raise the aforesaid controversy, if they are so advised, before the jurisdictional Consumer Forum which will answer the question as and when raised.
7.      In view of the above-referred order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court it will be for the District Forum to decide whether the development work is complete in all respects or not.
8.      The order passed by both the Fora below are, therefore, set aside and the matter is remitted back to the District Forum to adjudicate solely on the question as to whether the development work is complete in all respects or not and decide the complaint afresh.  The parties are directed to appear before the District Forum on 07.04.2020.
9.      Considering the age of the petitioner/complainant the District Forum shall decide the complaint afresh within 3 months of the parties appearing before it.  It shall be open to the parties to produce such additional evidence as they may seek to produce before the District Forum, on the issue which the District Forum has to adjudicate upon.
MA No. 151/2019 and the RP No. 4640 of 2019 both stand disposed of accordingly.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN, PRESIDING MEMBER (ORAL)
No one is present for the respondents despite service.  I have therefore, heard the learned counsel for the complainants/appellants and have considered the record.
2.      The complainants/appellants booked small commercial spaces with the respondents in a project namely ‘KST Metropolitan Shopping Arcade’, which the respondent was to develop in Sector-89 of Faridabad.  On allotment of commercial spaces to the complainants, they executed Memorandum of Understanding with the respondents incorporating the respective rights and obligations of the parties in respect of the commercial spaces allotted to the complainants/appellants.  As per clause 5 of the Memorandum of Understanding, commercial spaces were to be constructed and completed within 36 months thereof subject to force majeure circumstances.  The project having not even started by the opposite parties despite payment having been made by them, they approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Consumer Complaints seeking refund of the amount which they paid to the respondents alongwith compensation etc.
3.      No one appeared for the respondents before the District Forum and no written version was filed.  The respondents were therefore, proceeded ex-parte.
4.      Vide impugned order dated 01.02.2018, the State Commission dismissed the complaints solely on the ground that the complainants/appellants had failed to prove that the commercial spaces were booked by them for the purpose of earning their livelihood by way of self-employment.
5.      The question as to when a person buying goods or hiring or availing service, can be said to be a consumer, came up for the consideration of a Three-Members Bench of this Commission in Tosoh India Pvt. Ltd. (Formerly Lilac Medicare Pvt. Ltd.) Vs. Ram Kumar & Ors. RP/2833/2018 decided on 06.01.2020 and the following view was taken:
(a)     Only a person engaged in large scale commercial activities for the purpose of making profit is not a consumer;
(b)     There should be a direct nexus between the large scale commercial activities in which a person is engaged and the goods purchased or the services hired or availed by him, before he can be excluded from the purview of the term ‘consumer’.  Therefore any goods purchased or the services hired or availed even by a person carrying on business activities on a large scale for the purpose of making profit will not take him out of the definition of the term ‘consumer’, if the transaction of purchases of goods or hiring or availing of services is not intended to generate profit through the large scale commercial activity undertaken by him and does not contribute to or form an essential part of his large scale commercial activities.
(c)     What is crucial for the purpose of determining whether a person is a ‘consumer’ or not is the purpose for which the goods were purchased or the services were hired or availed and not the scale of his commercial activities.
(d)    The explanation below Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act is clarificatory in nature.
(e)     A person purchasing goods or hiring or availing services for a consideration, for the purpose of earning his livelihood by way of self-employment is a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
6.      On a perusal of the record, I find that though the complainants had specifically averred in the Consumer Complaint that they had booked commercial spaces in order to earn their livelihood, they did not specify in the complaints as to for what specific purpose, the commercial space were booked by them nor did they disclose as to what business or profession they would have carried out in the aforesaid commercial spaces after taking their possession.  In fact, they did not even say in the Consumer Complaint that they would have personally worked in the commercial premises which they had booked with the respondents.  However, I am in agreement with the learned counsel for the appellant that they should be given opportunity to satisfy the State Commission by filing an additional affidavit or otherwise that they had booked commercial spaces with the respondents for the purpose of earning their livelihood by way of self-employment.  If the appellants state so on oath, that should, in the absence of any rebuttal, be sufficient to prove their case in this regard provided that the complainants/appellants also disclose in their affidavit the specific business/profession in which they wanted to engage after taking the possession of the commercial spaces from the respondents.  They will also be entitled to file additional documents with their respective affidavits, if they so desire.
7.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the impugned orders are set aside and the Consumer Complaints filed by the appellants/complainants are remitted back to the State Commission to decide the same afresh after considering the affidavit in terms of the liberty granted to the appellants/complainants by this Commission.

On behalf of the appellants this matter was argued on 24.02.2020.  The matter has been argued today on behalf of the respondent though; no-one is present for the appellants / complainants.
2.      The complainants / appellants applied to the respondent Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Housing Building Societies Ltd., which is a State Agency engaged in construction of houses and flats in the State of Punjab and disbursal of loan to its members for construction of houses in the Rural and Urban areas of the State, for allotment of residential flats in a Scheme ‘Super Deluxe Flats’, which the respondent was to construction in Section 79 of SAS Nagar, Mohali.  Allocations were made to the complainants / appellants and the cost of the flat was also paid by them in due course.  No specific timeframe for delivery of possession of the flats was committed by the respondent.  The possession to the complainants / appellants however, came to be offered on 14.7.2014.
3.      The respondent had also collected excess amount towards stamp duty from the complainants which the respondent later refunded to them, without any interest on that amount.  After taking possession of the flats, the complainants / appellants approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate consumer complaints, seeking interest on the amount which they had paid for the flats as well as on the excess stamp duty which the respondent had collected from them, along with compensation etc.
4.      The complaints were resisted by the respondent, which inter-alia stated in its reply that the possession of the land came to be delivered to them only on 24.2.2010 and therefore, they could not be faulted for the delay in completion of the construction.  According to the respondent, though, two land sites had been allotted to it by Punjab Urban Planning & Development Authority (PUDA) for construction of residential flats of different categories and the possession of the said sites was delayed by PUDA.
5.      The State Commission vide impugned orders directed the respondent to pay interest to the complainant @ 12% per annum on the amount of the excess stamp duty with effect from the date the said amount was taken till its refund.  The respondent was also directed to pay compensation quantified at Rs.55,000/- to each set of complainants for the mental agony and harassment suffered by them.  The said compensation also included the litigation expenses.  Being aggrieved the appellants are before this Commission.
6.      In FA/1484/2018 Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd. Vs. Chander Pal Tyagi, decided on 14.5.2019 a similar matter came to be considered by this Commission, in that case, the State Commission had directed the respondent to pay interest for delay in possession of the flats by way of interest @ 9% per annum with effect from 07.9.2010, along with compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.  Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission in that case, the respondent had approached this Commission by way of the above referred appeal.  Modifying the order passed by the State Commission in that case, this Commission inter-alia held as under:
","“4.           It is not in dispute that the appellant is not a private builder but an instrumentality of the State of Punjab, having been set up interalia for the purpose of construction of houses and providing financial assistance to its members for the said purpose. A perusal of the affidavit filed by the appellant in compliance of the direction of this Commission dated 7.5.2019 would show that whatever amount the appellant receives from the members/allottees is deposited in a account from which all payments are made by it. The said account is stated to be a savings bank account. Therefore, at best the appellant earned interest  on the amount received from the complainant, for the period for which interest @ 9% p.a. has been awarded to him by the State Commission. Considering that the appellant is not engaged in the business of constructing houses, is not actuated by any profit motive and is primarily helping the residents of the State by constructing houses for them on self-finance basis and giving financial assistance to them for construction of houses, the appellant in my opinion should not be burdened with interest to the extent awarded by the State Commission. The appellant in my opinion should pay compensation in the form of simple interest at the savings bank rate for the period the interest has been awarded by the State Commission. Therefore, the impugned order is modified to the extent that instead of awarding interest and compensation in terms of the order of the State Commission, the appellant shall pay compensation in the form of simple interest @ 4% per annum to the complainant within six weeks from today. The order passed by the State Commission is modified accordingly and appeal stands disposed of.”
7.      In the present case, the State Commission has awarded interest @ 12% per annum to the complainants / appellants on the amount of the excess stamp duty, which it had collected from the complainants / appellants.  Though, the impugned order has not been challenged by the respondent, the aforesaid direction, in my opinion can be suitably modified by this Commission, while considering the appeal of the complainants on the quantum of compensation for the delay in offer of possession of the allotted flats to them, both the reliefs being part of the same consumer complaints.  In my opinion, considering the interest rates prevailing at the relevant time, the direction for payment of interest @ 12% per annum by a State Agency would not be justified.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, including the interest rates prevalent at the relevant time, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest @ 9% per annum to the complainants / appellants on that amount.  Ordered accordingly.
8.      Coming to the compensation for the delay in possession of the allotted flats, though no specific timeframe was committed by the respondent to the complainants / appellants, the respondent could not have delayed the possession of the flats for an indefinite period.  Even if the possession of the land on which the flats were to be constructed by the respondent was given late to it by PUDA, the respondent invested or utilized for its own purposes, the amount which it had collected from the complainants / appellants before receiving possession of the land form PUDA.  The said amount would have been spent by the respondent on the construction of the houses only after possession of the land had been received by it from PUDA.  Considering all the facts and circumstances, the respondent, in my opinion should pay interest to the complainants with effect from the period of three years from the date on which allocation was made to them.  In terms of the order passed by this Commission in Chander Pal Tyagi (supra), the respondent should pay interest @ 4% per annum to the complainants / appellants with effect from three years from the date of allocation till the date on which the possession was offered by it to the complainants / appellants.  No separate compensation for the mental agony and harassment needs to be paid by the respondent.
9.      The compensation by way of interest @ 4% per annum in terms of this order, shall be payable only on the amount, which the complainants / appellants had paid to the respondent till the date on which possession of the land was received by it. The order passed by the State Commission therefore, stands modified accordingly.
10.    The payment in terms of this order shall be made within eight weeks from today.
The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.

","JUSTICE V. K.  JAIN (ORAL)
1.      Smt. Rashmi Motani, who was carrying business under the name of Maruti Impex on Shed No.F-157, Sitapura Industrial Area, Jaipur, had let out the said shed along with office block to the Complainant, Marutinandan Handicrafts Pvt. Ltd.. Her husband, Shri Ramesh Motani was a Director in the Complainant Company. One of the terms of the Rent Deed executed between Smt. Rashmi Motani and the Complainant stipulated that if there was any damage to the building during the tenancy period, the cost of such damage to the building would be borne by the Complainant.
2.      The Complainant obtained a Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy from New India Assurance Company Ltd. whereby the above referred building was insured to the extent of Rs.20,00,000/-, the plant & machinery installed therein was insured to the extent of Rs.8,00,000/- and the stock was insured to the extent of Rs.30,00,000/-.
3.      During subsistence of the Insurance Policy, a fire broke out in the oil depot of Indian Oil Corporation situated in Sitapura Industrial Area which, inter alia, caused damage to the adjoining industrial units. The factory of the Complainant as well as the stock of furniture kept therein got damaged. The plant & machinery installed in the factory was also damaged to some extent. On intimation being given to the Insurer, one Shri K.C. Sharma was appointed as the Surveyor to inspect the factory and assess the loss. Vide his Report dated 10-03-2010, Shri K. C. Sharma assessed the net loss to the Complainant at Rs.7,76,127.83/- comprising loss on account of damage to the building, the damage to the plant & machinery and the damage to the stock. The gross loss to the Complainant was assessed by him at Rs.10,92,351.21/-. After making deduction on account of under insurance, depreciation, salvage and policy excess, he arrived at the net payable amount of Rs.7,76,127.83/-.
4.      The Insurer, vide its letter dated 15-03-2010 sent to the Surveyor, sought to know how he had made assessment for loss to the stock when the furniture had got only loosened and opened as a result of the impact. It was also pointed out in the letter that the Surveyor had assessed the stock on the basis of selling price whereas it ought to have been assessed on cost basis.
5.      The Surveyor vide his letter dated 20-04-2010 informed the Insurer that the pressure waves were so intense that they had developed cracks on the walls, detached the doors and windows from the walls, broken glasses as well as roof structure of the factory which was within 500 meters from IOC Depot. He further stated in his reply that pressure waves badly vibrated the items, causing cracks on wood and loosening the joints as a result of which the stock of furniture came to be rejected by the exporters. However, it was admitted by the Surveyor that the profit margin had not been deducted by him. The Insurer was asked to deduct 10.05% as profit margin.
6.      The Insurer offered a sum of Rs.3,54,573/- to the Complainant which they refused to accept. A Consumer Complaint was then instituted by the Complainant with the concerned District Forum.
7.      The Complaint was resisted by the Insurer which, inter alia, stated in its reply that this shed was owned by Maruti Impex which had let it out to the Complainant and under an umbrella policy issued by them to Indian Oil Corporation, Smt. Rashmi Motani, owner of Maruti Impex who was the original allottee of Property No.F-157, Sitapura Industrial Area, was paid a compensation of Rs.1,95,711/- through RIICO.
8.      The District Forum, vide its Order dated 28-02-2014, directed the Insurer to pay a sum of Rs.7,76,127/- to the Complainant along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the Complaint. Compensation quantified at Rs.51,000/- was also awarded to the Complainant.
9.      Being aggrieved from the Order passed by the District Forum, both the parties approached the concerned State Commission by way of separate Appeals. Vide impugned Order dated 08-04-2015, the State Commission partly accepted the Appeal filed by the Insurer and directed it to pay a sum of Rs.5,70,650/- to the Complainant along with interest awarded by the District Forum. The Appeal filed by the Complainant was dismissed. Being dissatisfied with the Order of the State Commission, both the parties are before this Commission by way of these Revision Petitions.
10.    It is an admitted position that the shed where manufacturing of furniture was being carried by the Complainant is the shed allotted by RIICO to Smt. Rashmi Motani who was carrying business under the name and style of Maruti Impex. The said shed was let out by Smt. Rashmi Motani to the Complainant Company for a period of two years. Though the loss to the shed on account of impact from the fire which broke out in IOC Depot was of Smt. Rashmi Motani, the Complainant having agreed, in terms of the Rent Deed executed with her, to bear the loss on account of any damage to the building, the Complainant became liable to reimburse her for the loss due to the said damage to the building. The Complainant having undertaken to bear the loss on account of damage to the building, it had an insurable interest in the shed and that is why the shed was insured in the name of the Complainant. Therefore, it would not be correct to say that the Complainant Company was not entitled to any reimbursement on account of damage to the shed.
11.    The Surveyor assessed the gross damage to the shed at Rs.4,94,701.21/-. The Surveyor obtained the Valuation Report from one Engineer, Shri Giriraj Prasad Nagar, who assessed the value of the shed at Rs.27,18,000/-. Since the shed had been got insured only for Rs.20,00,000/- there was obviously an under insurance as far as the shed is concerned. Therefore, the Surveyor, in my opinion, was justified in making deduction on account of under insurance of the shed. The Surveyor also applied depreciation on the factory shed as well as the office building. The submission of the Learned Counsel for the Complainant is that there is no justification for applying depreciation when under insurance had already been applied based upon the current market value of the building. I, however, find myself unable to accept the contention. The current value of the building is usually assessed after application of depreciation. The current value does not necessarily mean the value of the new construction as on the date of valuation. Though the Report of Shri Giriraj Prasad Nagar was not produced before the District Forum, the fact remains that no request was made by the Complainant to the District Forum to direct the Insurer to produce the Valuation Report of Shri Giriraj Prasad Nagar. The correctness of the said Report was not challenged in the Consumer Complaint. No Valuer was produced by the Complainant to prove that the assessment made by Shri Giriraj Prasad Nagar with respect to the prevailing value of the building was not correct. Therefore, I see no reason to reject the valuation taken by the Surveyor on the basis of the Report of Shri Giriraj Prasad Nagar, which I presume was made after applying the depreciation.
12.    After application of depreciation, salvage and under insurance the net amount payable to the Complainant came to Rs.2,69,095/- as far as the building is concerned. The detailed calculation in this regard have been given on page F of the Synopsis & List of Dates in Revision Petition No.1654 of 2015 filed by New India Assurance Co. Ltd..
13.    As noted earlier, the shed was allotted by RIICO to Smt. Rashmi Motani and not to the Complainant. The building, therefore, belongs to her and not to the Complainant which was only to bear the loss on account of damage to the building resulting from some natural calamity. Admittedly, Smt. Rashmi Motani has already received Rs.1,95,711/- through RIICO on account of damage to the building. Therefore, the Complainant will have to compensate her only to the extent she has already not been compensated by RIICO.
14.    The submission of the Learned Counsel for the Complainant is that in a meeting held at the Head Office of Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. on 25/26-02-2010 it had been agreed that no deduction will be made for the ex gratia payment made by RIICO at the behest of the State Government of Rajasthan to the various parties affected by the fire since such payments were made as a matter of grace. A perusal of the receipt issued by Smt. Rashmi Motani, while receiving Rs.1,95,711/- shows that the said payment was received by her as ad hoc relief against the damage due to IOC fire at her industrial shed on the basis of an assessment made by RIICO/IRDA Approved Surveyor.
15.    The minutes of the meeting held on 25/26-02-2010 would show mean that while making payment in terms of the Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy and the Liability Policy, which Indian Oil Corporation had taken, the payments made by RIICO at the behest of Rajasthan Government were not to be deducted. But, this would not mean that the said payment will also not be deducted while assessing the claim under a Standard Fire & Special Perils Policy, which the Complainant had taken from New India Assurance Company Ltd.. If no deduction is made on account of the payment received by Smt. Rashmi Motani through RIICO, it would result in a situation where she gets compensated for the loss suffered by her through New India Assurance Company Ltd., since the payment which the Complainant receives on account of damage to the building has to be transferred by the Complainant to her and she would also be able to retain the amount of Rs.1,95,711/-. An Insurance Policy is meant to reimburse a person for the actual loss suffered by him and cannot be used as a bounty. Therefore, the amount which Smt. Rashmi Motani received through RIICO on account of damage to the building has to be deducted out of the assessment made by the Surveyor as far as loss on account of damage to the building is concerned. On deducting the aforesaid amount of Rs.1,95,711/- from the amount of Rs.2,69,095/-, the balance amount payable to the Complainant on account of damage to the building comes to Rs.73,384/-. The Insurer is required to pay the aforesaid amount to the Complainant, alongwith interest.
16.    As far as plant & machinery is concerned, there is no dispute between the parties, the loss having been assessed at Rs.27,000/-.
17.    As far as stock is concerned, though the Surveyor, Shri K. C. Sharma had assessed the loss at Rs.5,70,650/- before deduction of profit margin, the case of the Insurer is that the said stock had not become useless and could be repaired at the cost of Rs.68,478/-, the cost of repair being 12% of the value of the stock. As noted earlier, Shri K.C. Sharma informed the insured that as a result of the impact, the pressure waves had caused cracks on the wood and loosened their joints, resulting in the furniture not remaining of the accepted standard and was rejected by the exporters. No evidence was led by the Insurer to prove that the report given by Shri K. C. Sharma in this regard was not correct. No evidence was led by the Insurer before the District Forum to prove that the stock of furniture was repairable and could be exported after the necessary repairs. The Learned Counsel for the Insurer submits that in his Preliminary Report dated 06-11-2009, the Surveyor had assessed the probable loss to the furniture only at Rs.15,000/-. This, in my opinion, would be of no consequence since a detailed report was later given by him on inspection of all the items of furniture. More importantly, even the Insurer did not make any attempt to get the furniture examined from a third party and obtain an assessment that the furniture was repairable despite the damage caused to it and it could be exported after carrying out the requisite repairs. If the Insurer felt that the furniture could be easily repaired it ought to have either made some furniture manufacturer or expert inspect the said furniture and give a report stating therein that the items of furniture could be repaired and then exported or it ought to have ascertained the market value of the damaged furniture. If the furniture worth Rs.5,70,000/- was easily repairable on incurring expenditure to the extent of about 12% of the cost of the furniture, it would have fetched a much higher price in the market as compared to the salvage value of Rs.36,000/- assessed by the Surveyor. The furniture worth Rs.5,70,650/- cannot have salvage value of only Rs.36,000/- if the said furniture is easily repairable and can be exported after carrying out the said repairs at the cost of 12% of the value of the furniture. In any case, nothing prevents the Insurer from retaining the salvage of the furniture and paying the salvage value of Rs.36,000/- to the Complainant.
","18.    For the reasons stated herein above, the Complaint and the Revision Petitions are disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      the Complainant shall be entitled to a sum of Rs.73,384/- on account of damage to the building along with interest on that amount at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of Consumer Complaint till the date of payment;
(ii)      for the stock of furniture, the Insurer shall be entitled to deduct 10.05% as profit margin from the amount of Rs.5,70,650/- and will be further entitled to deduct policy excess of Rs.10,000/- and salvage value of Rs.36,000/- and shall pay the balance amount to the Complainant, if the salvage is retained by the Complainant. If the Insurer wants to retain the salvage it shall be entitled to do so but in that case it shall not make deduction of Rs.36,000/- on account of salvage. The balance amount in that case shall be paid to the Complainant along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of institution of the Complaint till the date of payment.
It has been noted by the State Commission in the impugned Order that the Complainant had agreed to retain the salvage at Rs.1,21,600/-. If this was so with the consent of the Insurer, then the Insurer shall be entitled to deduct a sum of Rs.1,21,600/- and not Rs.36,000/- on account of value of the salvage of the furniture. If it is found that the Complainant had not agreed to retain the salvage at Rs.1,21,600/-, it shall return the entire salvage as found by the Surveyor to the Insurer and in that case no deduction on account of salvage shall be made. If it transpires that neither the Complainant has agreed to retain the salvage at Rs.1,21,600/- nor is the Insurer interested in retaining the salvage in that case deduction of only Rs.36,000/- towards salvage value of the furniture shall be made.
The Orders passed by the Fora below stand merged in this Order.

","JUSTICE V.K.JAIN (ORAL)
The complainant/respondent purchased plywood from the petitioner for the purpose of using the same in making furniture meant, for being used in a photo studio, which the complainant  is running in a place namely Tilak Path, Talab Chowk, Khargone, Madhya Pradesh. The plywood purchased by the complainant allegedly had stamp of a brand name Dynora and also had ISI mark on it. The case of the complainant is that since the plywood sold to him  was of inferior quality the furniture which he got made using that plywood developed defects, the plywood having started peeling off. The complainant, therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking refund of the price which he had paid for the plywood, along with compensation.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the petitioner which maintained that the plywood sold by them to the complainant was of good quality and in fact the complainant was yet to pay the balance amount of Rs.28549/-.
3.      The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. Vide impugned order dated 22.02.2013 the State Commission dismissed the Appeal filed by the petitioner. Being still dissatisfied the petitioner is before this Commission.
4.      A perusal of the consumer complaint would show that it was specifically alleged in the complaint that the plywood sold to the complainant had the mark of Dynora on it besides having Impressions of ISI mark. This would mean that the petitioner represented to the complainant that the plywood being sold to him was of the making  Dynora, and had been manufactured as per ISI standards. This is also the case of the complainant in the consumer complaint itself that the ISI stamp on the plywood was fake meaning thereby that the manufacturer of the plywood did not have ISI registration for the said plywood. In its written version the petitioner did not specifically refute the allegation that the plywood sold to the complainant had mark of Dynora as well as ISI mark on it. If the plywood sold by the petitioner to the complainant had genuine ISI mark on it the petitioner ought to have proved the same by examining the manufacturer of the plywood and should also prove the ISI registration granted to the manufacturer for the aforesaid plywood. That having not been done, the inevitable inference is that the plywood sold by the petitioner to the complainant did not have a genuine ISI mark on it and, therefore, did not confirm to the prescribed standard. If a product with a fake ISI mark is sold to a consumer that by itself would be an act of selling defective goods to the consumer, besides being use of unfair means. In fact, such an act may also constitute cheating the consumer.
5.      The Ld. counsel for the petitioner submits that they are the authorised dealer of Dynora plywood. That, however, would make no difference since they led no evidence to prove that the plywood manufactured under the brand name Dynora had a valid ISI mark on it. Therefore, the case of the defect in the goods sold to the complainant is clearly made out.
6.      The next submission of the Ld. Counsel is that the plywood was purchased by the complainant for commercial purpose. The plywood was used for making furniture which the complainant was to use in his photo studio, the complainant being a photographer by profession. It is not known what was the size of the studio and what was the scale of the business of photography which the complainant was carrying in the said studio. It is also not known whether the complainant had engaged any employee and if so, what was the number of the employees engaged by him. The finding on the question as to whether the complainant was a consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act or not would depend primarily upon the scale of the business/profession which the complainant was carrying in the studio in which the furniture was to be used. Since no evidence on the said issue was led by either party it becomes imperative to remit the matter back to the District Forum to decide the complaint afresh after recording a clear-cut finding on this issue. For this purpose the District Forum shall give an opportunity to the parties to lead such evidence as they may deem appropriate on this limited issue.
","7.      If the District Forum after giving opportunity to the parties to lead evidence on this limited issue comes to the conclusion that the complainant was a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, he would be entitled to the compensation awarded by the State Commission along with interest at the rate of 9% p.a. from the date of the order of the State Commission. If the District Forum comes to the conclusion that the complainant was not a ‘consumer’ within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, the consumer complaint will be liable to be dismissed with liberty to the complainant to avail such remedy other than a consumer complaint as may be open to him in law. The parties shall appear before the District Forum on 21.09.2020. The District Forum shall decide the consumer complaint afresh within three months of the parties appearing before it. The revision petition stands disposed of.

3.       The matter relates to repudiation of a postal life insurance policy claim re one late Raj Singh. The respondent complainant Mrs. Poonam Devi is the widow of the said insured deceased Raj Singh.
4.       The District Forum vide its Order dated 04.07.2019 had allowed the complaint on contest. The operative paragraph of the District Forum’s Order is reproduced below:
5. In view of aforesaid observations and findings, we allow the present complaint of complainant with the directions to the OPs to release the assured amount as per policy document Ex. C-2 to the complainant within a period of 30 days after receiving the copy of this order, failing which said amount will carry an interest @9% p.a. from the date of filing the present complaint till its realization. As the OPs have repudiated the claim on vague and flimsy grounds for which  the complainant has to undergo mental harassment and agony, we also award a compensation of Rs. 21,000/- to the complainant on account of such mental agony and harassment so suffered by the complainant on account of negligent and deficient act of the OPs. We further direct the OP No. 1 to pay a further sum of Rs. 5500/- to the complainant on account of litigation expenses for the present unwanted and unwarranted litigation only due to the deficiency in service on the part of the OPs. The complaint stands disposed of accordingly.
(as per the translated copy furnished by the Postal Department)
5.       In first appeal, the State Commission passed an interim Order dated 06.03.2020, which is reproduced below:
Learned counsel for the respondent has placed on record the Power of Attorney.
Adjourned to 03.09.2020 for arguments.
In the meantime, the appellants shall deposit the awarded amount with the learned District Forum within 45 days from today. The said amount be thereafter disbursed to the respondent on her furnishing adequate security to the satisfaction of the learned District Forum.
(as per the certified copy furnished by the Postal Department)
6.       The instant revision petition has been filed against the said interim Order dated 06.03.2020 of the State Commission accompanied with an application for condonation of delay.  The number of days of delay has been left blank in the said application. However, in the interest of justice, to settle the case brought before this Commission on merit, the delay in filing the revision petition is condoned.
7.       It is noted that the State Commission has as yet to adjudicate on the first appeal filed before it. The impugned Order dated 06.03.2020 is but an interim order, a plain reading of which shows that the State Commission has but directed that the amount awarded by the District Forum shall be deposited by the Postal Department with the District Forum and that the District Forum shall disburse the same to the complainant on her furnishing adequate security to the satisfaction of the District Forum.
8.       It goes without saying that if the litigation by the Postal Department succeeds, the Postal Department would be free to recover the said amount from the complainant against the security furnished and/or by taking recourse to execution proceedings (‘enforcement’ and ‘penalties’, both), as per the law.
9.       Learned counsel for the petitioner Postal Department was specifically requested to provide any judgment of the Hon’ble Apex Court or of this Commission, which proscribes such type of interim order(s) in a case of such texture and specificities. No such judgment was forthcoming from the learned counsel.
10.     In the light of the above (paras 7, 8 and 9), this Commission is not inclined to interfere, in this particular case, with the interim order dated 06.03.2020 of the State Commission, no jurisdictional error or legal principle ignored or miscarriage of justice is visible.
11.     It is made explicit that this Commission has consciously refrained from entering into or commenting on the merits in the case, since the first appeal before the State Commission has as yet to be adjudicated by the State Commission, on the facts and the law, on merit, and this Commission does not in any way want to colour the vision of the State Commission.
","12.    With the above discussion, this petition is dismissed.
13.    Let a copy each of this Order be sent by the Registry to the State Commission and to the complainant within three days without fail.

","JUSTICE V.K. JAIN (ORAL)
No one is present for the petitioner when this matter is called.  A letter has been sent by Sh. N.K. Bhalla, Advocate who appears to be the husband of the complainant/petitioner, enclosing a copy of the order of the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana  dated 6.9.2019 and requesting that the matter may be decided on merits in his absence. I have, therefore, considered the record.
2.      Shri Nirmal Kumar Bhalla  husband of the complainant / petitioner obtained a Mediclaim Policy from the respondent for the period from 10.8.2017 to 13.2.2018. The complainant was admitted in a hospital on 11.9.2017 and was treated there, incurring an expenditure of Rs.197660/-. The claim for reimbursement in terms of the Mediclaim Policy taken by him was rejected by the respondent vide letter dated 28.6.2018 which to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
“The company shall not be liable to make any payment under this policy in respect of any expenses whatsoever incurred by any Insured person in connection with or in respect of:
4.9 Convalescence, general debility; run-down condition or rest cure, Obesity treatment and its complications including  morbid obesity, congenital external disease/defect or anomalies, treatment relating to all psychiatric and psychosomatic disorder, infertility, Sterility, Venereal disease intentional self injury and use of intoxication drugs/alcohol.”
3.      Being aggrieved, she approached the District Forum by way of a consumer complaint seeking payment of the aforesaid amount with compensation etc.
4.      The complaint was resisted by the insurer primarily on the ground that since the complainant had taken treatment for infertility, the claim was not admissible in view of the Exclusion Clause contained in the insurance policy.
5.      The District Forum having dismissed the consumer complaint, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal. The said appeal also having been dismissed, she is before this Commission by way of this revision petition.
6.      Clause 4.9 of the Medilciam Policy, which comes under the head ‘Exclusions’ reads as under:-
“4. Exclusions : The company shall not be liable to make any payment under this policy in respect of any expenses whatsoever incurred by any Insured person in connection with or in respect of:
4.1    xxxx           xxxx                      xxxx                      xxxx
xxxx            xxxx                      xxxx                      xxxx “4.9 Convalescence, general debility; run-down condition or rest cure, Obesity treatment and its complications including  morbid obesity, congenital external disease/defect or anomalies, treatment relating to all psychiatric and psychosomatic disorder, infertility, Sterility, Venereal disease intentional self injury and use of intoxication drugs/alcohol.”
It would thus been seen that the Mediclaim Policy taken by the husband of the complainant did not cover any treatment relating to infertility.
7.      This is not the case of the petitioner that the treatment taken by her was not related to infertility. Therefore, the said treatment is clearly excluded in terms of Clause 4.9 of the Mediclaim Policy taken by her husband. The view taken by the Fora below, therefore, does not call for any interference by this Commission in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction.
8.      The petitioner had filed a writ petition before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana which came to be withdrawn on 6.9.2019 with liberty to the complainant to avail her remedy against the order passed by the State Commission. A  Consumer Forum such as this Commission cannot go into the legality  or otherwise of the terms of an insurance policy. If the petitioner/complainant has a grievance with respect to Clause 4.9 of the terms and conditions of the policy, the Consumer Forum is not the appropriate Forum for this purpose. The Consumer Forum has to decide a consumer complaint on the basis of the contract of insurance executed between the parties and in terms of Clause 4.9 of the said contract, the condition for which treatment was taken by her was excluded from the benefits available under the Mediclaim Policy taken by the husband of the complainant.
","9.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the revision petition is dismissed with no order as to costs. One copy of this order be sent to the petitioner for information.

","Late Shri Mohan Lal, husband of the complainant took an insurance cover under group cover life of the petitioner company.  He having died on 07.10.2015 within two years of taking the policy, a claim for payment in terms of the said insurance policy was lodged by the complainant with the petitioner bank.  The claim was rejected vide letter dated 11.02.2016, which to the extent it is relevant reads as under:
“Late Mohan Lal, while applying for enrolment under the SBI Rin Raksha Home Loan Scheme had agreed ‘Declaration of Good Health’ when mentions that he was of sound health and was not suffering or had never suffered from any Critical Illness or any condition requiring medical treatment for illness, as on date of enrolment.
As per the medical treatment papers dated May 2014 available with us, Late Mohan Lal was suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia prior to the date of enrolment of  policy.
The deceased Life Assured had given a false Good Health, Declaration and had not disclosed material fact at the time of entry it to the scheme the claim has repudiated.”
Being aggrieved from the repudiation of the claim, the complainant approached concerned District Forum by way of a consumer complaint.
2. The complaint was resisted by the petitioner primarily on the ground that while taking the insurance cover, the complainant had suppressed material fact with respect to the state of his health since he didn’t disclose that he was suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia before he had applied for the insurance cover on his health.
3. The District Forum having allowed the consumer complaint, the petitioner approached the concerned State Commission by way of an appeal.  The State Commission having dismissed the appeal, the petitioner is before this Commission by way of this Revision Petition.
4. A perusal of discharge summary issued by Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar in respect of late Sh. Mohan Lal then aged 56 years would show that he was admitted in the said hospital on 14.05.2014 with complaint of breathlessness for 3 months, knee pain and abdominal fullness.  His ailment was diagnosed as COPD Pneunonitis.  He was treated symptomatically while in hospital and was fit at the time he was discharged.  Several medicines were prescribed to him at the time he was discharged from the hospital.  The prescriptions issued by the doctors of the Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar would show that late Sh. Mohan Lal was under treatment of the said doctors and had been prescribed medication from time to time.  A large number of medical prescriptions issued prior to the submission of the proposal for obtaining the insurance cover have been filed by the petitioner company.
5. The submission of the learned counsel for the respondent/complainant is that no doctor having been examined from the hospital, the medical record relied upon by the petitioner was not duly proved.  As noted earlier, the claim was repudiated vide letter dated 11.02.2016.  In the repudiation letter, it was clearly stated that as per the medical treatment, papers of May, 2014, Sh. Mohan Lal was suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia prior to the date of enrolment of policy and that he had given a false good heath declaration and had not disclosed his past history.  Despite that, the complainant who is none other than the wife of deceased didn’t even claim that the deceased had not suffered from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia.  Therefore, the ground on which the claim was repudiated was not specifically controverted in the consumer complaint filed by the respondent.
6. In its written version to the consumer complaint, the petitioner company specifically referred to the treatment of the deceased in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar.  It was expressly stated in Para-6 of the written version that Sh. Mohan Lal was suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia prior to the date of enrolment into the insurance cover.  The discharge sheet of Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar was specifically referred in Para-7 of written version filed by the opposite party.  The certificate of hospital treatment issued by Dr. Tarun Aggarwal was referred in Para-8 and 9 of the written version.  The leave taken by him on medical grounds was referred in Para-10 of the written version.  Despite detailed averments with respect to the treatment of the deceased Mohan Lal in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar having been given in the written version, the said illness was not disputed either by way of a rejoinder or by way of an affidavit.  Thus, the ailments on account of which the deceased was admitted in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar and was treated in the said hospital were not disputed by the complainant.  If she was disputing the record of medical treatment relied upon by the petitioner, she ought to have done so by filing a rejoinder or an affidavit by way of evidence, after the said written version had been filed by the petitioner company.  From whatever angle I look at it, the facts remain the complainant did not dispute the allegations of admission of late Sh. Mohan Lal in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar and his treatment in the said hospital, at any point of time, since the consumer complaint was instituted.  In fact, this was not her stand even during arguments before the State Commission that the deceased was never admitted in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar.  Therefore, I am unable to accept the contention that the petitioner company cannot rely upon the medical record with respect of the treatment of the deceased in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar.
7. While submitting the proposal late Sh. Mohan Lal was required to answer several questions with respect to the state of his health.  Some of the question required to be answered by him were as under:
i. Have you consulted any doctor for surgical operations or have been hospitalised for any disorder other than minor cough, cold or flu during the last 5 years?
ii. Have you ever had any injury, major surgical operation or received any treatment for any medical conditions for a continuous period of more than 14 days? (except for minor cough, cold, flu, appendicitis & typhoid).
iii. Have you suffered from any other diseases not mentioned above.
The answers given by the deceased were in negative to all the above referred questions.  Since he had suffered from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Pneumonia, he had been hospitalised for about one week and had also been under regular treatment of the doctors as is evident from the medical prescriptions filed by the petitioner, he ought to have disclosed the said ailment as well as his hospitalisation in Sacred Heart Hospital, Jalandhar.  The ailment from which the deceased was suffering cannot be said to be minor cough, cold and flu.  Therefore, the said ailment was required to be disclosed at the time of submitting the proposal for obtaining insurance cover on his life.  That having not been done, there is no escape from the conclusion that the deceased insured had concealed facts with respect to the state of his health which had influenced the decision of the insurer on the question as to whether the insurance cover should be granted to him or not.  It is quite possible that had his past ailment and treatment been disclosed by the deceased, insurance cover would have been refused to him and he would have been asked to undergo further medical investigation.
8. In a recent decision, LIC of India Vs. Manish Gupta – Civil Apeal No.3944 of 2019, decided on 15.04.2019, the proposal form required a disclosure as to whether the proposer had suffered from Cardiovascular disease.  He responded in negative to the said question. The complainant underwent a surgery and submitted a claim which was repudiated on the ground that he was suffering from a pre-existing illness. Upholding the repudiation of the claim, the Hon’ble Supreme Court inter alia held as under:-
“Moreover, non-disclosure of any health event is specifically set out as a ground for excluding the liability of the insurer.”
“A contract of insurance involves utmost good faith. In Satwant Kaur Sandhu Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd., this Court has held thus:
“...Thus, it needs little emphasis that when an information on a specific aspect is asked for in the proposal form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within his knowledge. It is not for the proposer to determine whether the information sought for is material for the purpose of the policy or not. Of course, obligation to disclose extends only to facts which are known to the applicant and not to what he ought to have known. The obligation to disclose necessarily depends upon the knowledge one possesses. His opinion of the materiality of that knowledge is of no moment.”
……….The documentary material indicates that there was a clear failure on the part of the respondent to disclose that he had suffered from rheumatic heart disease since childhood. The ground for repudiation was in terms of the exclusions contained in the policy. The failure of the insured to disclose the past history of cardiovascular disease was a valid ground for repudiation.”
In another recent decision, Reliance Life Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rekhaben Nareshbhai Rathod – Civil Appeal No.4261 of 2019, decided on 24.4.2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court interalia observed as under:-
“26.    …………..It is standard practice for the insurer to set out in the application a series of specific questions regarding the applicant's health history and other matters relevant to insurability. The object of the proposal form is to gather information about a potential client, allowing the insurer to get all information which is material to the insurer to know in order to assess the risk and fix the premium for each potential client. Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries. This allows the parties to serve their interests better and understand the true extent of the contractual agreement.
The finding of a material misrepresentation or concealment in insurance has a significant effect upon both the insured and the insurer in the event of a dispute. The fact it would influence the decision of a prudent insurer in deciding as to whether or not to accept a risk is a material fact. As this Court held in Satwant Kaur (supra) “there is a clear presumption that any information sought for in the proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurane”. Each representation or statement may be material to the risk. The insurance company may still offer insurance protection on altered terms.
29.     We are not impressed with the submission that the proposer was unaware of the contents of the form that he was required to fill up or that in assigning such a response to a third party, he was absolved of the consequence of appending his signatures to the proposal. The proposer duly appended his signature to the proposal form and the grant of the insurance cover was on the basis of the statements contained in the proposal form.  …………..”
","9. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the order passed by the State Commission cannot be sustained and same is hereby set aside.  Consequently, the Consumer Complaint is dismissed, with no order as to costs.

","Revision petition No. 1231 of 2016 has been filed by the petitioner Jalandhar Improvement Trust  against the order dated 23.02.2016 passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Punjab, (in short ‘the State Commission’) in Appeal No.1166 of 2015.  Similarly Revision Petition Nos.1669 of 2016 and 1670/2016 have been filed by the petitioner Jalandhar Improvement Trust  against the order dated 04.03.2016 of the State Commission, passed in Appeal Nos.730 of 2015 & 1070 of 2015.
RP 1231 of 2016
2.      Brief facts of the case are that in the original complaint, the complainant is Krishan Lal Kukreja, to whom residential plot no.98-D measuring 250 sq.yards was allotted as per allotment letter dated 02.04.2012 for total consideration of Rs.44,20,950/- inclusive of cess charges and fee.  Out of total consideration, complainant has paid 25% of the amount i.e. Rs.8,08,450/- on 02.05.2013 and the remaining 75% of the amount which was to be paid in 5 installments, is yet to be paid by the complainant.  Hence, the total amount deposited is Rs.12,33,450/- (including earnest money).  The complainant issued a legal notice dated 09.01.2015 demanding to deliver the possession or give the interest on amount already deposited with OPs.  District Forum decided the complaint No.148/2015 filed by the complainant vide its order dated 21.09.2015 and directed OPs to refund an amount of Rs.12,33,450/- along with interest @9% p.a. from the date of deposit + Rs.3,000/- as litigation expenses to the complainant.  State Commission vide its order dated 23.02.2016 dismissed the appeal of the OPs.
3.      Hence the revision petition.
RP 1669/2016 & RP 1670/2016
4.      Brief facts of the case are that in the original complaint, the complainant is Baldeep Singh, to whom residential plot no.145-D measuring 250 sq.yards was allotted as per allotment letter dated 23.12.2011 for total consideration of Rs.44,20,950/- inclusive of cess charges and fee.  Out of total consideration, complainant has paid 25% of the amount i.e. Rs.10,62,500/- as per the scheme and the remaining 75% of the amount which was to be paid in 5 installments, is yet to be paid by the complainant.  Hence, the total amount deposited is Rs.14,87,500/- (including earnest money).  The trust issued a public notice dated 20.01.2016 asking allottees to obtain the possession.  Further, the trust sent a letter dated 02.05.2016 to obtain the demarcation of the allotted plot after depositing the balance amount.  The complainant issued a legal notice demanding to deliver the possession or give the interest on amount already deposited with OPs. The complainant then filed complaint.  District Forum vide its order dated 01.06.2015 allowed the complaint No.449 of 2014 and directed OPs to refund the deposited amount along with interest @9% p.a. from the date of deposit + Rs.3,000/- as litigation expenses to the complainant. State Commission vide its order dated 04.03.2016 dismissed the appeal of the OPs (FA 730/2015), whereas, partly allowed the appeal of the complainant and directed OPs to pay an amount of Rs.50,000/- as compensation apart from the relief allowed by the District Forum (FA/1070/2015).
5.      Hence the revision petitions.
6.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
7.      The learned counsel for the Jalandhar Improvement Trust ( JIT) stated that once an applicant under a scheme becomes successful in the lottery draw, then there is no provision of refund of deposited amount  under the rules of the Trust. In fact, the respondents/complainants are seeking refund because the real estate market has gone down and the complainants may not be seeing their investment growing up as rapidly as they had thought when they booked the plots. In fact, the plots are ready and the Trust is ready to hand over the possession immediately to the complainants. Even all the development works are complete in the scheme. If the complainants were the genuine seekers of plots for the residential purpose, then they should have come forward to take the possession. The fact is that these complainants were basically investors and had booked these plots for commercial purpose with a view to earn profit. Thus, these complainants cannot be considered as consumers under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. When the Trust is ready to hand over the possession of developed plots, there should be no question of refund to the complainants. The fora below have not considered this aspect and have ordered the refund to these complainants along with heavy interest.
8.      It has been further stated by the learned counsel for the JIT that it was in respect of only a small portion of project land that the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana had ordered a status quo, but there was no stay in respect of most of the plots and there was no hindrance in taking the possession. The fora below have considered status quo as operating for all such complainants also.
9.      The learned counsel for the JIT further stated that in fact, after the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana on 22nd December 2015, a general resolution was passed by the Trust that Trust will proceed with the project and the possession would be given to the allottees soon. In the public notice, it was mentioned that the development work will start soon and possession may be taken by the allottees in January 2016. The Trust also gave individual notices to all the complainants to come and take possession, however, complainants did not come to take possession.
10.    On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent stated that there was no development work on the ground as the same was halted due to the ‘status quo’ order of the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana.  The petitioner has admitted that they issued the general public notice clearly stating that development work will start soon.  This only means that till the end of 2015 there was no development work on the project site.  It is not correct to say that the plots are developed and the opposite party is in a position to hand over the position.  The fact is that the plots even cannot be demarcated properly on the site.  Moreover, complainants cannot wait for indefinite period to get the possession as their money would be blocked.  Therefore, complainants are justified in seeking refund.
11.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by both the sides and have examined the record of each case. The common issue is whether the complainants are entitled to get refund. In a similar case of the same project, this commission in consumer complaint no. 172 of 2016 Raj Kumar Goyal versus Jalandhar Improvement Trust has observed the following:-
“10.       The question whether stay was on the part of the land or on the whole land is immaterial because, the public notice wherein it has been stated that the development work will start soon and possession may be taken in January 2016 was issued for all the allottees. The plot of the complainant was also covered under the stay as no offer letter for possession was issued to the complainant before the date of order of the Hon’ble High Court. Even the individual letter of offer of possession was only issued on 23.02.2016.  The public notice clearly shows that before the order of the Hon’ble High Court, there was no development work going on in pursuance of the order dated 08.03.2011 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh. Therefore, there is force in the contention of the learned counsel for the complainant that the complainant wanted refund as he did not want to engage in any form of litigation as the land was in dispute.
11.   Moreover it is seen that the letter dated 23.02.2016 which is being called as offer letter for possession by the OPs is really not an offer letter of possession as it is only a letter of demand and to get the allotted plot demarcated as would be clear from the contents of this letter which reads as under:
“You were allotted the plot in the above noted Surya Enclave Extension. As you are that some of the land owners had filed a case in the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana in which they had obtained the stay on some portion of the acquired land because of which great difficulties were being faced to undertake the development works simultaneously. After the decision in favour of the Trust on 22.12.2015, the development works such as Roads, Water Supply and Sewerage are being carried out at a great speed. You are requested to come to the Trust Office and deposit the balance amount/ after the execution of the agreement, obtain the demarcation of your plot”.
12.   It is also true that once there was a status quo order dated 08.03.2011 from the Hon’ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh, the scheme floated should have been stayed by the OPs, however, they accepted the booking amounts and also allotted plot numbers to different allottees. In fact, the further amounts were also received.
13.   In my view, these activities of the OPs amount to unfair trade practice and thus, deficiency in service on the part of the OPs is evident. Otherwise also, as possession was to be delivered in the year 2014 as per the scheme, however, the same was allegedly offered in February 2016. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.12238 of 2018 titled as “Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. versus Govindan Raghavan” has observed that if the possession is highly delayed, the complainant cannot be compelled to accept the property in question and the complainant has every right to seek refund. The order reads as follows:
“3.8. The National Commission vide Final Judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018 allowed the Consumer Complaint filed by the Respondent - Flat Purchaser, and held that since the last date stipulated for construction had expired about 3 years before the Occupancy Certificate was obtained, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession at such a belated stage. The grounds urged by the Appellant - Builder for delay in handing over possession were not justified, so as to deny awarding compensation to the Respondent - Flat Purchaser. The clauses in the Agreement were held to be wholly one - sided, unfair, and not binding on the Respondent - Flat Purchaser. 6 The Appellant - Builder was directed to refund Rs. 4,48,43,026/- i.e. the amount deposited by the Respondent - Flat Purchaser, along with Interest @10.7% S.I. p.a. towards compensation.
9. We see no illegality in the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Commission. The Appellant - Builder failed to fulfill his contractual obligation of obtaining the Occupancy Certificate and offering possession of the flat to the Respondent - Purchaser within the time stipulated in the Agreement, or within a reasonable time thereafter. The Respondent - Flat Purchaser could not be compelled to take possession of the flat, even though it was offered almost 2 years after the grace period under the Agreement expired. During this period, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser had to service a loan that he had obtained for purchasing the flat, by paying Interest @10% to the Bank. In the meanwhile, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser also located an alternate property in Gurugram. In these circumstances, the Respondent - Flat Purchaser was entitled to be granted the relief prayed for i.e. refund of the entire amount deposited by him with Interest.
","10. The Civil Appeals are accordingly dismissed, and the Final Judgment and Order dated 23.10.2018 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission is affirmed.”
12.    As the facts of these cases are more or less similar to the above referred case, the observations of this Commission in the above referred case are fully and equally applicable in these cases.
13.    From the observations made in the judgment of this Commission in Raj Kumar Goyal versus Jalandhar Improvement Trust (Supra), the assertion of the learned counsel for the JIT that the JIT is ready with the possession and therefore refund should not be ordered cannot be considered because after the sufficient gap after due date of possession, a complainant cannot be compelled to take possession as per the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in  Civil Appeal No.12238 of 2018 titled as “Pioneer Urban Land & Infrastructure Ltd. versus Govindan Raghavan” which has been already referred in the Raj Kumar Goyal’s case (supra)
14.    The learned counsel for the JIT has also vehemently argued that under the rules of the JIT,  once an allottee has become successful in the lottery then his money cannot be refunded and if the same is refunded, the JIT would be entitled to forfeit the earnest money. The complaints have been filed under the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and the consumer forum has power to order refund under section 14 (1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986. Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the JIT cannot be sustained. It is just a presumption of the learned counsel for the JIT that the complainants are seeking refund as they are not hopeful of getting expected returns on their investment as no proof has been filed in this regard. The complainants had booked the plots with the JIT and therefore they are definitely the consumers.
15.    In the circumstances of the cases, I do not see this breach of the agreement as resulting into the forfeiture of their earnest money. Moreover, the earnest money can only be forfeited if the opposite party has suffered any loss as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in M/s. Kailash Nath Associates Vs. Delhi Development Authority & Anr., Civil Appeal No.193 of 2015, decided on January 09, 2015, wherein the following has been observed:-
“29.        Based on the facts of this case, it would be arbitrary for the DDA to forfeit the earnest money on two fundamental grounds. First, there is no breach of contract on the part of the appellant as has been held above. And second, DDA not having been put to any loss, even if DDA could insist on a contractual stipulation in its favour, it would be arbitrary to allow DDA as a public authority to appropriate Rs.78,00,000/- (Rupees Seventy Eight Lakhs) without any loss being caused. It is clear, therefore, that Article 14 would apply in the field of contract in this case and the finding of the Division Bench on this aspect is hereby reversed.”
16.    In the present cases, the plots have been developed now as per the assertion of the JIT and therefore they will most likely sell at a higher price than the prices when the plots were originally booked. Thus, there seems to be no chances of suffering any loss by the opposite party. Accordingly in the light of the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Kailash Nath Associates versus DDA (Supra) no justification is made out for forfeiture of the earnest money.
17.    On the basis of the above discussion, in RP No.1669 of 2016 & RP No.1670 of 2016, it is seen that the State Commission has awarded a compensation of Rs.50,000/- over and above the relief granted by the District Forum. As the interest is also in the form of compensation, no separate compensation is justified.
18.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any illegality, material irregularity or jurisdictional error in the order dated 23.02.2016 of the State Commission passed in Appeal No.1166/2015 which calls for any interference from this Commission.  Accordingly, the revision petition No.1231 of 2016 is dismissed.
19.    In respect of RP No.1669 of 2016 & RP No.1670 of 2016, the order of the State Commission awarding compensation of Rs.50,000/- to the complainant is set aside and the order of the District Forum dated 01.06.2015  is upheld.  Accordingly, RP No.1669 of 2016 & RP No.1670 of 2016 stand disposed of.

  For the Appellant     :MR. BHARAT SWAROOP SHARMA 
  For the Respondent      :MR. MAIBAM N. SINGH 
","JUDGEMENT
The complainants who are appellants in FA/685/2013 and respondent in FA/91/2014 obtained an insurance policy from the  United India Insurance Co. Ltd. which is the respondent in FA/685/2013 and appellant in FA/91/2014, which covered the building of the complainants to the extent of Rs.45 lakhs, plant and machinery to the extent of Rs.20 lakhs and the stock of goods to the extent of Rs.35 lakhs. During subsistence of the insurance policy, the stock of Tuver Dal and Tuver Chuni  kept in the mill of the complainants got damaged on 30.6.2005 due to heavy rain and flooding. On intimation being given to the insurer, R.M Sheth & Associates were appointed as the surveyors to assess the loss to the complainants. Vide their report dated 11.11.2005 they assessed the gross loss to the complainants at Rs.2645484.24. However, holding that there was under insurance to the extent of 76.65%, the surveyor recommended deduction of Rs.2025118.18 alongwith policy excess of Rs.31018.30 and recommended payment of Rs.589347.76. The said amount when offered by the insurer was not accepted by the complainants who approached the concerned State Commission by way of a consumer complaint, claiming that they had suffered loss to the extent of Rs.3311998/-.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the insurer, primarily on the ground that there was huge under insurance and the surveyor had rightly assessed the value of the affected stock after making deduction on account of under insurance and policy excess.
3.      The State Commission vide impugned order dated....directed the insurer to pay a sum of Rs.2645484/- to the complainants alongwith interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of the complaint,  compensation quantified at Rs.25,000/- and the cost of litigation quantified at Rs.20,000/-.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, the insurer is before this Commission by way of FA/91/2014. Since the complainants are also dissatisfied with the compensation awarded to them by the State Commission, they are also before this Commission by way of FA/685/2013.
5.      It is an admitted position that the stock kept in the mill of the complainants was insured only to the extent of Rs.35 lakhs. The case of the complainants is that they were keeping stocks valued at not more than Rs.35 lakhs in the mill whereas the rest of the stock was being stored by them in a godown which they had taken on rent from Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills.
6.      On a perusal of the inspection report, I find that the surveyor had assessed the total value of the stock of the complainants at Rs.14929863/- on the basis of the stock register and the balance sheet of the previous years. The report of the surveyor shows that the balance of the stock was Rs.17235027.30 in the year 2004-05 and Rs.10979574/- in the year 2003-04. The complainants were not maintaining separate stock registers one in respect of the stock kept in the mill and the other in respect of the stock alleged to have been kept in the godown taken on rent.
7.      The survey report does not indicate that the surveyor had  physical counted the entire stock kept in the mill of the complainants and the quantity derived by it was based upon the said physical inspection. The survey report clearly shows that the quantity of the total stock was derived on the basis of the stock register and support from the balance sheet of the previous years was taken by the surveyor in making such an assessment.
8.      In responds to the Questionnaire served upon him by the complainants, the surveyor clearly stated that he had not visited the rented godown for physical verification. He did not claim while responding to the Questionnaire that the total quantity of stock was assessed by him on the basis of the physical inspection and not on the basis of the stock register and the balance sheet of the previous years.
9.      As per the report of the surveyor, when he visited the mill of the complainants, he found water level at 2 ft. from the floor level of the godown and he had counted physically the entire affected stock kept in the godown. He inspected Tuver Dal and Tuver Chuni  kept in 3510 bags and the total quantity of the Tuver Dal and Tuver Chuni  so inspected by him was found to be 1274 quintal and 497 quintal respectively. He, however, segregated the affected stock from the stock which had not been affected due to flood water and found that the quantity of the affected Tuver Dal  was 1054.60 quintals and the quantity of the affected Tuver Chuni was 416.5 quintals. On the other hand, the total quantity of the stock as per the stock register was 175950 + 497 + 1275 + 298 + 12.60 + 3163.95 quintals. The surveyor does not even claim to have actually seen that much stock in the mill of the complainants. The inevitable inference would be that instead of physically counting the stock, he chose to assess the total quantity of the stock on the basis of the stock register alone.
10.    This is the not the case of the complainants that as per the stock register, it was not having stock quantified by the surveyor. The case of the complainants is that the said stock had been kept at two places, part of the stock having been kept in the mill and the part having been kept in the godown taken on rent from Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills. The complainants did tell the surveyor that the remaining stock had been kept by them in the godown which they had taken on rent w.e.f. 1.4.2005. Despite that, the surveyor chose not to visit the godown at Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills to verify the quantity of the stock kept in the said godown.
11.    The written synopsis filed by the complainants would show that they had filed before the State Commission the documents evidencing taking a godown on rent at Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills on Anand-Sojitra Road in Anand. They claim to have produced letters  dt. 1.4.2005 and 27.9.2005 from Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills. They also claim that they had filed a copy of the rent note which they executed with Mahalaxmi Pulse Mills. Therefore, the surveyor, in my opinion, was not justified in making deduction on account of the alleged under insurance without he having physically found stock worth more than Rs.35 lakhs in the mill of the complainants. Therefore, the deduction on account of the alleged under insurance has rightly been disallowed by the State Commission.
12.    As regards the appeal filed by the complainants who are disputing the assessment made by the surveyor with respect to the value of the affected stock, I find that though the complainants had claimed damage to the stock admeasuring 497 quintal of Tuver Chuni  and 1274 quintal of Tuver Dal, the surveyor on the basis of physical inspection found that quantity actually affected due to floods was found to be 1054.6 quintal of Tuver Dal and 416.50 quintal of Tuver Chuni. He valued the said stock at Rs.2645484.24 on the basis of the rates given in an annexure to the report. The said annexure give all the required details including the applicable rates, freight, labour charges  and processing charges. Therefore, the assessment made by the surveyor, in my opinion, cannot be disputed.
","13.    For the reasons stated hereinabove, I hold that the order passed by the State Commission after disallowing the under insurance was justified except that the policy excess amounting to Rs.31018.30 is also required to be deducted from the amount awarded by the State Commission. The appeals are, therefore, disposed of with the following directions:-
(i)      The insurer shall pay a sum of Rs.2614465.94  (Rs.2645484.24 – Rs.31018.30) to the complainants alongwith interest at the rate awarded by the State Commission.
(ii)      The complainants shall also be entitled to the cost of litigation awarded by the State Commission but there is no justification for awarding compensation over and above the interest awarded to the complainants and therefore, the direction for payment of Rs.20,000/- as compensation is set aside.
(iii)     The payment in terms of this order shall be made within three months from today.

Ms. Poonam Atey, Advocate
For Hansa H. Agarwal          :         Mrs. K. Radha, Advocate
The complainant who is the respondent in FA/680/2013 and appellant in FA/722/2013, entered into an agreement with the appellant in FA/680/2013 who is the respondent in FA/722/2013 for purchase of a residential flat admeasuring 850 sq. ft. of built-up area (inclusive of the balcony area).  The possession, as per the agreement executed between the parties on 11.11.1995, was to be delivered to the complainant by December 1995.  The possession however, was not delivered by December 1995 whereupon a police complaint was lodged by the complainant against the builder.  The parties then executed a supplementary agreement dated 02.01.1997 whereby the builder agreed to deliver possession by 30.06.1997 and also agreed to reimburse rent with effect from 01.01.1997.  The possession of the flat was delivered to the complainant on 27.11.1997.  The case of the complainant is that the actual built-up area of the flat, on measurement, was found out only 704 sq. ft. and thus, the area actually provided was less by 146 sq. ft.  The complainant also alleged that the builder had not provided municipal water nor had he provided adequate sewerage facilities as a result of which, he was incurring expenditure of Rs.150/- per month on obtaining potable water from outside and the flat buyers had to incur expenditure of Rs.5,00,000/- for overhauling sewerage system and for getting the water connection which resulted in every flat owner contributing Rs.20,000/- for this purpose.  The complainant therefore, approached the concerned District Forum by way of a Consumer Complaint claiming (i) the compensation for the short area delivered to him (ii) compensation for the delay in delivery of possession as well as the compensation for not providing potable water and adequate sewerage.
2.      The complaint was resisted by the builder which denied any shortage in the built-up area of the flat delivered to the complainant.  It was also stated that as per the supplementary agreement, the possession was to be delivered by 30.06.1997 and since possession could not be delivered by that date, alternative accommodation was duly provided to the complainant.  As regards sewerage facility, it was stated in the written version filed by the builder that since unauthorized construction was carried out by the flat owners, the builder could not get the requisite Occupancy Certificate as well as regular water and sewerage connection.
3.      The State Commission partly allowed the Consumer Complaint and directed as under:
Opponent/Builder is hereby directed to pay to the Complainant an amount of 1,67,900/- together with interest thereon @ 18% p.a. with effect from 27th November, 1999 till its realization.
Rest of the claims of the Complainant stands dismissed.
Opponent/Builder shall bear its own costs and pay costs of 25,000/- to the Complainant.
4.      Being aggrieved from the order passed by the State Commission, both the parties are before this Commission by way of these cross-appeals.
5.      As regards the delay in delivery of possession, it is not in dispute that as per the original agreement executed between the parties on 11.11.1995, possession was to be delivered by December 1995.  It is also not in dispute that the possession was not delivered by December 1995 and therefore, a supplementary agreement was executed whereby the complainants agreed to grant extension till 30.06.1997.  A perusal of clause 4 of the supplementary agreement would show that on the request of the builder, the complainant agreed to the extension of time on the condition that the builder would reimburse her rent for the period from 01.01.1997 until the date of delivery of possession.  Thus, the complainant, while granting extension till 30.06.1997, did not insist upon any compensation for the period from January 1996 to December 1996 and agreed to grant such extension if rent for the period from January 1997 till the date of delivery of possession was paid to him.  The learned counsel for the complainant submits that the complainant had no option but to agree to the aforesaid term since the possession was not being delivered to him by the builder.  However, I find no such averment in the Consumer Complaint.  In para 2(g) of the complaint, it was specifically stated that a representative of the builder was summoned to the Police Station where he agreed to deliver possession on or before 30.06.1997.  It is thus evident that the time till 30.06.1997 for delivery of the possession was given in a Police Station where the builder was not in a position to exert any kind of pressure upon the complainant.  In any case, there is no averment in the Consumer Complaint that the complainant was coerced into signing the supplementary agreement or that the possession having been delayed, he was left with no option but to agree to the terms dictated by the builder.  Therefore, it would be difficult to say that the supplementary agreement was executed under any kind of pressure or coercion.  The complainant therefore, was entitled to rent only for the period from January 1997 as per the supplementary agreement executed between the parties.  I have no hesitation in holding that the complainant had given up his right to claim compensation for the delay in delivery of possession for the period from January 1996 to December 1996 and had agreed to take such compensation or an alternative accommodation from the builder only for the period from 01.01.1997.
6.      As far as shortfall in the area is concerned, a perusal of the report of the Consultant would show that the Consultant, on measurement, found that the built-up area of the flat was only 704 sq. ft.  No evidence in rebuttal having been led, I see no ground to disbelief or reject the report of the Consultant and accordingly, hold that the built-up area of the flat delivered to the complainant was only 704 sq. ft.  The learned counsel for the builder submits that the built-up area measured by the Consultant does not include balcony area whereas, as per the agreement between the parties, the built-up area was to include the balcony area.  My attention has been drawn to the Certificate of Area dated February 28, 2000.  It is not possible to verify from this Certificate as to whether the built-up area reported by the Consultant namely Best Mulyankan Consultants Ltd. included the balcony area or not though the learned counsel for the builder submits that the lay-out plan prepared by the Consultant would itself show that the balcony area was not included in the built-up area.  It is not possible for this Commission to go into this detail in the absence of the Consultant.  Therefore, this is a matter which, in my opinion, needs to be dealt with by the State Commission in execution proceedings.  If the State Commission, on examining the Consultant and considering his report after such examination, finds that the balcony area is not included in the built-up area reported by the Consultant, the balcony area will be ascertained and added to the built-up area reported by the Consultant.  If there is no shortfall in the built-up area so arrived at by the State Commission, the complainant will be entitled to proportionate refund of the price of the flat paid by him to the builder alongwith interest on that amount @ 9% per annum from the date of institution of the Consumer Complaint till the date on which the payment in terms of the calculation made by the State Commission is actually made.
7.      As far as the sewerage and potable water supply are concerned, it is evident from the written version filed by the builder that neither the sewerage nor potable water was provided.  There is no evidence of any unauthorized construction having been made by the flat owners or such unauthorized construction having prevented the concerned authorities from issuing the requisite sewerage and water connection for the complex constructed by the builder.  Therefore, the complainant, in my opinion, is entitled to the amount of Rs.20,000/- which he has claimed to be his share in the expenditure incurred on augmenting the water and sewerage facilities.
","8.      For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeals are disposed of with the following directions:
(i)      The complainant shall not be entitled to any compensation for the delay in delivery of possession.
(ii)      The complainant shall be entitled to refund of the proportionate price of the flat if the State Commission, after examining the Consultant in terms of this order, comes to a conclusion that the actual built-up area of the flat delivered to the complainant inclusive of balcony area, is less than 850 sq. ft.
(iii)     The complainant shall be entitled to compensation quantified at Rs.20,000/- towards reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by him in augmenting the sewerage and water facilities.
(iv)    The complainant shall also be entitled to interest on the amount found payable to him @ 9% per annum from the institution of the Consumer Complaint till the date of payment.
No order as to costs.

","1.   Heard learned counsel for the appellants.
Learned proxy counsel is present for the respondent. Learned arguing counsel is not available.
2.   Perusal of the record shows that FA no. 1621 of 2019 has been moved against an interlocutory Order dated 09.07.2019 of the State Commission and F.A. No. 1969 of 2019 has been moved against an earlier interlocutory Order dated 26.11.2018 of the State Commission.
3.   The F.A. no. 1621 of 2019 has been filed within limitation.
The F.A. no. 1969 of 2019 has been filed with reported delay of 55 days. Perusal of the reasons for delay, as stated in paras 2 to 14 of the application for condonation of delay, point towards managerial inefficiency and perfunctory and casual attitude to the law of limitation, they are illogical and unpersuasive in explaining convincingly and cogently the delay in filing the appeal. Sufficient cause to explain the delay is not visible.
However, in the interest of justice, to settle the matter on merit, the delay in filing F.A. No. 1969 of 2019 is condoned, subject to reasonable cost of Rs. 10,000/- to be paid by the appellants / opposite parties to the respondent / complainant on or before the next date of hearing before the State Commission, which, as submitted by learned counsel for the appellants, is 17.03.2020.

  For the Respondent      :Mr. Rajesh Kr. Bhawnani, Advocate 
","This revision petition has been filed by the petitioner New India Assurance Co. Ltd. against the order dated 20.11.2015 of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chhattisgarh, (in short ‘the State Commission’) passed in Appeal No.FA/15/100.
2.      Brief facts of the case are that the respondent/complainant had taken an insurance policy for Jai Sriram Paddy Parboiling unit plant and machinery from the petitioner/opposite party (in short OP) for Rs.60,00,000/- and another policy of Rs.58,50,000/- for Jai Sriram Rice Mill for the period from 29.12.2012 to 20.12.2013. On 3.7.2013 a fire broke out in the parboiling unit causing huge loss to the machinery of plant and 40 tonnes paddy valued at Rs.6,00,000/- was turned to ashes. The incident was informed to OP and police station. Complainant incurred a sum of Rs.15,27,000/- to replace the machinery in the plant along with fitting labour charges. Complainant sent the duly filled claim form along with all the documents to the OP on 27.7.2013.  Surveyor appointed visited and examined the place of occurrence as well as took photograph of the same. On 27.8.2013 OP sent a letter stating that assessment of damage by surveyor is not possible on account of non-availability of the damaged machine and the claim could not be satisfied.
3.      Complainant filed complaint praying to direct OP to pay the cost of burnt machinery i.e. Rs.13,56,000, cost of 40 tonne paddy i.e. Rs.6,00,000/- along with fitting charges and labour cost totalling to 19,77,000 along with 12% p.a. interest and Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation. District Forum vide its order dated 19.12.2014 allowed the complaint and directed OP to pay Rs.15,27,000/- incurred in replacing the machinery in place of the damaged machinery, Rs.50,000/- as compensation and Rs.3,000/- towards cost. OP filed an appeal wherein State Commission vide its order dated 20.11.2015 partly allowed the appeal. State Commission observed that the complainant filed the claim only to the tune of Rs.19,77,000/- by waiving amount of Rs.1,50,000/-, however, the waived amount was not adjusted by the District Forum. Hence, State Commission modified the order and directed OP to pay Rs.13,77,000/- within one month otherwise be liable to pay interest @ 9% p.a. to the complainant. The remaining of the order was just and proper and did not call for any interference.
4.      Hence, revision petition has been filed by opposite party.
5.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.  Learned counsel for the petitioner stated that the paddy was not covered under the policy and therefore, no claim can be granted for the loss of paddy.  The State Commission has also not allowed this claim for loss of paddy.
6.      Coming to the loss of machinery, it has been claimed by the complainant that Heat Exchanger was totally damaged due to fire, however, the damaged Heat Exchanger was never shown to the surveyor, though the surveyor started visiting the insured since the day of fire.  In this regard, the learned counsel pointed out towards the following observations of the surveyor:-
“INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION:  On 03.07.2013 at about 4 p.m. undersigned visited to insured’s premises along with branch manager of the insurer and inspected the paddy parboiling unit and damaged stock, Much of the paddy got burnt and found in lumps form.  Heat exchanger was covered with sheets in shell form so unable to inspect without dismantling.  The cause of discussed with insured and found that due to excessive super saturated steam in the dryer/heat exchanger the paddy temperature got rised and it caught fire.
The damages to the heat exchangers are not cleared until it was not dismantled.  Undersigned requested insured to call while the repairer will come for inspection of damages to the heat exchanger.
In the mean while after 15 days insured asked over cell phone that said heat exchanger was already inspected by repairer and we have replaced the heat exchanger and damaged one was shifted to M/s. Bhagat Industries, Industrial area, Dhamtrari.
Undersigned visited to Dhamtari and asked the representative of Bhagat Industries for producing the damaged heat exchanger of M/s. Jai Shree Ram Paddy parboiling unit but he was unable to show the same and told that they have no such damaged heat exchanger.
Again undersigned contact with insured but he was always telling that the damaged heat exchanger was shifted to Dhamtari.
Lastly undersigned conclude that the loss occurred in the paddy is not covered under the policy and insured has not informed while dismantling of heat exchanger nor shown the damaged heat exchanger so without inspection of damaged heat exchanger undersigned unable to assess the loss.  Insurer may close the claim as NO CLAIM.”
7.      On the basis of the above observation of the surveyor, the Insurance Company has repudiated the claim as the claim cannot be granted for any machinery for which the surveyor has not assessed the loss.  The machinery was never produced before the surveyor for assessing the loss.  The State Commission has accepted the claim in respect of Heat Exchanger on the basis that later on the complainant wrote a letter on 03.09.2013 to the Insurance Company that the damaged Heat Exchanger has been brought back and the same may be inspected.  However, the machine was not inspected by the surveyor after that time.  It has been argued that the surveyor was required to see the damaged machine on the spot and no purpose would have been served, even if the surveyor was to visit the damaged machine after it was brought from Bhagat Industries as there was no guarantee that the same damaged machine was produced or the quantum of damage was the same.  The State Commission has relied on the letter dated 03.09.2013 of the complainant and the deficiency in the service has been attributed to the Insurance Company for not assessing the loss by visiting the site again.  There was no compulsion to shift the machine when the surveyor had asked the complainant to inform him as and when the repairer comes and the machine is dismantled so that the damaged machinery could have been inspected by the surveyor at the site.  No permission was given to shift the machinery to the repairer.  The claim has been lodged on the basis of the bills submitted by the Bhagat Industries whereas, the surveyor has categorically stated in the above observation that complainant informed that Heat Exchanger has been replaced and the damaged Heat Exchanger was sent to the Bhagat Industries for repair.  If the Heat Exchanger was already replaced by the complainant, then there should have been no need for the repair of the Heat Exchanger.  The complainant has violated the basic rules of insurance that the surveyor has to be allowed to inspect the damaged machinery on the site or if it is required to be shifted then the Insurance Company or the surveyor should have been informed.  Thus, the claim in respect of Heat Exchanger is not payable and both the fora below have passed erroneous order in this regard.
8.      On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/complainant stated that both the fora below have given concurrent finding so far as the fact of damage to the Heat Exchanger and its eligibility under the fire insurance policy is concerned.  Against the concurrent finding of fact, the scope under the revision petition is quite limited.
","9.      Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant further argued that to minimise loss, the damaged Heat Exchanger was urgently sent for repair to Bhagat Industries and the surveyor was informed that damaged Heat Exchanger was sent to Bhagat Industries for repairs.  When the surveyor was not satisfied, the complainant got the damaged Heat Exchanger back to the site and Insurance Company was informed on 03.09.2013 to get the damaged Heat Exchanger inspected.  However, nobody was sent for any inspection and the surveyor finalised his report by stating that damaged machine was not shown by the insured and therefore, loss could not be assessed. The surveyor recommended closure of the claim.  The Insurance Company without taking cognizance of the letter dated 03.09.2013 repudiated the claim on the basis of the surveyor’s report.  Complainant had no wrong intention for not showing the damaged machine to the surveyor.  The fact is that the insured machine had been damaged and the same was repaired by making payment to the repairer.  Both the fora below have only allowed the claim of repair as per the bills submitted by the complainant.  Thus, there is no merit in the revision petition and the same needs to be dismissed.
10.      I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined record.  Heat Exchanger was allegedly damaged in the fire, which occurred on 03.07.2013.  The surveyor was immediately appointed and he reached the spot on 03.07.2013 itself.  On that day the  surveyor could not inspect as the Heat Exchanger was covered with sheets in shell form as the same could not have been inspected without dismantling.  The complainant dismantled the machine and sent the Heat Exchanger for repair to Bhagat Industries without informing the surveyor or the Insurance Company.  As per the report of the surveyor, when he contacted the Bhagat Industries, he was told that no such Heat Exchanger machine was with them.  This whole sequence of events creates a doubt whether there was any damage to the Heat Exchanger.  No proof of damage to the Heat Exchanger has been recorded by the surveyor who was duly authorised to survey and to assess the loss.  It may be true that the complainant later on got the damaged Heat Exchanger and wrote to the Insurance Company for getting the same inspected.  It is also true that the surveyor may have inspected the same after letter dated 03.09.2013 before finalising the report.  However, the Insurance Company sent its reply explaining the position to the complainant on 11.09.2013.  The insurance is a matter of utmost trust and if a party creates any suspicion or doubt by its act then the whole process of insurance gets vitiated.  As per the report of the surveyor, when the surveyor contacted Bhagat Industries to inspect the damaged Heat Exchanger, he was informed that there was no damaged Heat Exchanger with them, whereas by that time as per the complainant’s version, Heat Exchanger was already sent to Bhagat Industries for repairs.  It was open to the complainant, to take the surveyor to Bhagat Industries and should have shown the damaged Heat Exchanger. The complainant had sent the Heat Exchanger without any permission from the surveyor or the Insurance Company and where the Heat Exchanger was sent, it was not available there, so either Heat Exchanger was not sent to Bhagat Industries or it was shifted to some other place or it was with the complainant itself.  Complainant has not given any explanation for removing the damaged Heat Exchanger from the site without giving information to the surveyor. In this background, none of the bills submitted by Bhagat Industries  can be considered as genuine and claim submitted in respect of damaged Heat Exchanger, is not payable as the surveyor was not able to verify and inspect the damaged Heat Exchanger due to smart moves by the complainant.
11.    Based on the above discussion, I find merit in the revision petition.  Accordingly, the revision petition No.483 of 2016 is allowed and order dated 19.12.2014 of the District Forum and the order dated 20.11.2015 of the State Commission are set aside and the complaint is also dismissed.

  For the Respondent      :For the Respondent No.1: Mr. Ayush Sariyar, Advocate
For the Respondent No.2: Mr. Kiran U.Patil, Advocate 
","This first appeal has been filed by the appellant Samuel Dorman challenging the order dated 14th August 2015 passed by the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission Mumbai (in short “the State Commission”) in consumer complaint No. CC/03 /183.
2.      The Complainant had booked a residential flat no.404 in Friends Co-op. Housing Society building with OP1 in or about the month of July 1995.  The total consideration of the flat as agreed by OP1 was Rs.7,59,225/- against which complainant made the payment of Rs.8,00,000/- i.e. excess amount of Rs.40,775/- to the OP1. However, despite making payment of entire amount of consideration, complainant was not given possession of the said flat as assured to be given in January 1998. Complainant from time to time, made enquiries with OP1 about the construction of the flat however, OP1 kept on giving false promises that he will complete the construction of the building and hand over possession of the flat.  It is further contended that in or about the first week of March 2003, complainant came to know that the opponent no.1 has entered into an agreement with the opponent no.2 for the construction of the incomplete work of the said building.  Therefore, complainant issued a legal notice dated 17.03.2003 to the OP1 calling upon to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the flat no.404 forthwith and to refund excess amount of Rs.40,775/- paid over and above the price of Rs.7,59,225/- and further Rs.10,000/- per month for each and every month’s delay from January 1998 but no positive response was made.  Therefore the complainant filed the consumer complaint before State Commission seeking alternate directions to the OP1 i.e.,
(i)  To hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the flat no.404.  In addition, OP1 be directed to pay to the complainant a sum of Rs.40,775/- towards refund of excess amount along with interest @24% p.a. Or
(ii)  In alternative, Refund an amount of Rs.8 lacs along with interest @24% p.a. from the date of payments till its realization.
(iii)  OP1 be directed to pay a sum of Rs.6,60,000/- to the complainant for the delay in handing over the flat @Rs.10,000/- per month from January 1998 till possession of the flat, a sum of Rs.5 lacs as compensation towards mental torture and Rs.1 lac towards costs of the complaint.
3.      The complaint was resisted by the respondent No.1/opposite party No.1 by filing the written statement stating that they have received only Rs.5 lakhs and allegation that Rs.3 lakhs were given in cash by the complainant is not correct. It was also mentioned that the total consideration of the flat was Rs.12,65,375/- instead of Rs.7,59,225 as alleged by the complainant. The opposite party No.1 stated that complainant did not pay the remaining amount by way of installments and therefore there was no question of handing over the possession to the complainant. Accordingly it was requested to dismiss the complaint.
4.      The State Commission, however, partly allowed the complaint and directed the opposite party No.1 to refund Rs.5 lakhs along with interest at the rate 12% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint till actual payment along with a compensation of Rs. 20,000 and cost of litigation as Rs.5,000/-. If the order was not complied within 30 days, the rate of interest will be 15% till realization.
5.      Aggrieved by the order of the State Commission, the complainant has filed the present appeal.
6.      Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. The learned counsel for the appellant stated that there was no reason why the State Commission should not have admitted the receipt given by the opposite party for Rs.3 lakhs in cash. In fact, the receipt is signed by a partner of the opposite party No. 1and there is seal of the opposite party No1. The opposite party has wrongly denied the receipt of Rs.3 lakh in cash. Moreover, the State Commission has not considered the request of the complainant to grant possession of the flat which was the main prayer of the complainant in the complaint. When the complainant has paid the total consideration, why should the complainant accept the refund? As  there has been rise in the  price of the flat, the opposite party does not want to sell the flat at the old price and therefore the opposite party is not interested in selling flat to the complainant.
7.      Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the State Commission, Mumbai, ought to have allowed the prayer of the complainant in respect of the possession of the flat; there is sufficient evidence on record to pass such order in favour of the complainant as the agreement entered between the parties is still existing, subsisting and not at all cancelled by any competent authority at any point of time.
8.      Learned counsel for the appellant stated that the State Commission, Mumbai, failed to appreciate the fact that the OP No.1 has received Rs.3,00,000/- cash from the appellant which was not considered by the State Commission and mechanically passed the impugned order without going into the merit of the case and conveniently ignored the provisions of the MOFA in respect of handing over the possession of the booked flat.  From the record, it is crystal clear that the opposite parties have contravened the provisions of Maharasthra Ownership of Flats Act, 1963.  Therefore, the opp. Parties are not entitled to take benefit of the same.
9.      Learned counsel for the appellant further stated that the State Commission, did not consider handing over the possession of the flat booked by the complainant and has given unnecessary importance to the documents filed by the opposite parties which are also not genuine.  When there was clear-cut evidence against the opposite parties of their committing unfair trade practice and deficiency in service and thereby contravening the provisions of MOFA by taking undue advantage of the rise in prices of the flats which should not have been allowed by the State Commission, and the flat booked by the complainant ought to have been handed over to the complainant as per the agreement for sale.
10.    On the other hand, the learned counsel for respondent No.1/ opposite party No.1 stated that the complainant did not pay the remaining amount of the consideration for the flat and meanwhile the cost of the flat also increased to about Rs.17 lakhs and the complainant did not pay any further amount except Rs.5 lakhs, therefore possession could not be given to the complainant. In these circumstances, the State Commission has passed a right order for refund of the amount given by the complainant. The complainant has forged the receipt for Rs.3 lakhs in cash and the State Commission has rightly rejected that receipt. It was requested to dismiss the appeal having no merits.
11.    The learned counsel for respondent No.2/ opposite party No.2 has stated that the work of the building has been given to respondent No.2 now and they are not concerned with the dispute between the respondent No.1 and the complainant.
12.    I have carefully considered the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and examined record. The State Commission has observed the following in respect of the receipt for Rs.3 lakhs allegedly given in cash and on the aspect of agreement between the parties:-
“As to Issue No.3:
It is the contention of the complainant that the total consideration of the flat as agreed upon with the opponent no.1 is Rs.7,59,225/-.  As against the total amount of consideration, complainant has claimed to have paid total sum of Rs.8 lacs as detailed below:-
(i) Rs.4 Lacs through receipt no.559 dated 16/07/1995 [by cheque]
(ii) Rs.1 lac through receipt no.606 dated 10/01/1996 [by cheuqe]
(iii) Rs.3 lacs [by cash]
However, opponent no.1 has admitted to have received only Rs.5 lacs, but has denied to have received Rs.3 lacs in cash.  From the perusal of said receipt of Rs.3 lacs, it reveals that it is in hand written and is without any date.  Though there is a stamp of the opponent no.1, the name of the signatory is not mentioned.  Therefore, this receipt of Rs.3 lacs as produced by the complainant is doubtful and therefore the same cannot be accepted.  According to the complainant, total consideration of the flat as mentioned above Rs.7,59,225/- to be paid by the complainant to the opponent no.1.  As per the contention of the complainant, possession of the flat was agreed to be handed over by opponent no.1 on or before January 1998 as stated in Clause No.11.  In fact, the complainant has placed agreement on record executed with the said Friends Co-operative Housing Society and said society is not party to the complaint.  There is no agreement produced on record as executed between the complainant and opponent no.1. Even if, there is no agreement, opponent no.1 had further agreed to hand over the possession of the flat by last week of June 2004 subject to verifying and ascertaining the position of payment of consideration as revealed from roznama dated 12/3/2004 in the delay proceedings i.e MA./03/2165.  However, as the complainant failed to make balance payment of the consideration of the said flat, he cannot be said to be entitled for the possession of the said flat. In fact, as revealed from the evidence filed by the opponent no.1[1(c)] that the construction of the building is yet incomplete and for completion of the incomplete work, society has already entered in to an agreement with the opponent no.2.  Therefore, question of making balance payment by the complainant to the opponent no.1 does not arise.  In view of this position, the complainant cannot be said as entitled for the possession.  However, it has become clear that amount of Rs.5 lacs is paid to the opponent no.1 and complainant has not been given possession.  Therefore, the complainant is entitled to get refund of Rs.5 lacs with reasonable interest from the opponent no.1.  Hence, we have given our findings as partly affirmative.”
13.    It is surprising to see that the complainant has not made the cooperative housing society as a party in the complaint case even though the main agreement is with the society. The State Commission has recorded that there is no agreement between the respondent No.1 and the complainant as nothing has been filed by the complainant either before the State Commission or before this commission. The appellant has not mentioned in the appeal that the appellant is ready to take the possession on the increased price of the flat. Clearly, if the price of the flat was Rs.12,65,375 which increased to Rs.17,20,075 and the complainant is not ready to pay even the original price of Rs.12,65,375, then, there can be no question of handing over possession to the complainant. Had cooperative society been a party in the case, the issue of cost could have been clarified by the society. In respect of the receipt for Rs.3 lakhs given in cash, the State Commission has correctly observed that the receipt does not bear any date and it is not in the format on which other receipts were issued to complainant. Had this amount been given by cheque or draft, the same could have been verified from other documents, however, it is not possible to verify any transaction of Rs.3 lakhs given in cash in the summary proceeding under the Consumer Protection Act 1986. If the complainant wants to pursue this matter, liberty can be granted to the complainant to approach the civil court where proper evidence can be adduced by both the parties and the matter could be decided by the civil court in respect of the payment of Rs.3 lakhs in cash.
","14.    Based on the above discussion, I do not find any infirmity in the order dated 14th August 2015 of the State Commission so far as it relates to the refund of Rs.5 lakhs to the complainant. However, it is seen that the State Commission has allowed interest at the rate 12% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint and not from the date of payment to the opposite party. When the amount paid by the complainant is being refunded, the complainant is entitled to interest from the date of respective deposits with the opposite party. In the present case, the amount of Rs.4 lakh was paid on 16th July 1995 and the amount of Rs.1 lakh has been paid on 10th January1996, therefore the interest should be paid from these dates and not from the date of filing of the complaint. Accordingly, the order of the State Commission dated 14th August 2015 stands modified to this effect only. The order of the State Commission as modified by this order be complied by the responded No.1/ opposite party No.1 within a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of this order, failing which 15% per annum interest Shall be chargeable instead of 12% per annum from the date of this order till actual payment. Liberty is also granted to the complainant to approach the civil court for recovery of Rs.3 lakhs that has been allegedly paid by the complainant to the respondent No.1/ opposite party No.1 in cash. The appeal is accordingly disposed of.
